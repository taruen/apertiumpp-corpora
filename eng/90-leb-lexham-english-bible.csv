GEN.1.1	In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth— 
GEN.1.2	Now
GEN.1.3	And God said, “Let there be light!” And there was light. 
GEN.1.4	And God saw the light, that it was good, and God caused there to be a separation between the light and between the darkness. 
GEN.1.5	And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day. 
GEN.1.6	And God said, “Let there be a vaulted dome
GEN.1.7	So
GEN.1.8	And God called the vaulted dome
GEN.1.9	And God said, “Let the waters under heaven
GEN.1.10	And God called the dry ground “earth,” and he called the collection of the waters “seas.” And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.11	And God said, “Let the earth produce green plants that will bear seed—fruit trees bearing fruit in which there is seed
GEN.1.12	And the earth brought forth green plants bearing seed according to its
GEN.1.13	And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. 
GEN.1.14	And God said, “Let there be lights
GEN.1.15	and they shall be as lights
GEN.1.16	And God made two lights,
GEN.1.17	And God placed them in the vaulted dome
GEN.1.18	and to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate light from darkness.
GEN.1.19	And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. 
GEN.1.20	And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly over the earth across the face of the vaulted dome
GEN.1.21	So
GEN.1.22	And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.” 
GEN.1.23	And there was evening, and there was morning, a fifth day. 
GEN.1.24	And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kind: cattle and moving things, and wild animals
GEN.1.25	So
GEN.1.26	And God said, “Let us make humankind in
GEN.1.27	So
GEN.1.28	And God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of heaven,
GEN.1.29	And God said, “Look—I am giving to you every plant that bears seed which is on the face of the whole earth, and every kind of tree that bears fruit.
GEN.1.30	And to every kind of animal of the earth and to every bird of heaven,
GEN.1.31	And God saw everything that he had made and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning, a sixth day. 
GEN.2.1	 And heaven
GEN.2.2	And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. 
GEN.2.3	And God blessed the seventh day, and he sanctified
GEN.2.4	These are the generations
GEN.2.5	before any plant of the field was
GEN.2.6	but a stream would rise from the earth and water the whole face of the ground—
GEN.2.7	when
GEN.2.8	And Yahweh God planted a garden in Eden in the east, and there he put the man
GEN.2.9	And Yahweh God caused to grow every tree that was pleasing to the sight and good for food. And the tree of life was in the midst of the garden, along with
GEN.2.10	Now
GEN.2.11	The name of the first is the Pishon. It went around all the land of Havilah, where there is gold. 
GEN.2.12	(The gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stones are there.) 
GEN.2.13	And the name of the second is Gihon. It went around all the land of Cush. 
GEN.2.14	And the name of the third is Tigris. It flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. 
GEN.2.15	And Yahweh God took the man
GEN.2.16	And Yahweh God commanded the man,
GEN.2.17	but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat
GEN.2.18	Then
GEN.2.19	And out of the ground Yahweh God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky,
GEN.2.20	And the man
GEN.2.21	And Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man.
GEN.2.22	And Yahweh God fashioned the rib which he had taken from the man
GEN.2.23	And the man
GEN.2.23	“She is now
GEN.2.23	and flesh from my flesh; 
GEN.2.23	she
GEN.2.23	for she was taken
GEN.2.24	Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cling to his wife, and they shall be as one flesh. 
GEN.2.25	And the man
GEN.3.1	Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal
GEN.3.2	The woman said to the serpent, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat, 
GEN.3.3	but from the tree that is in the midst of the garden, God said, ‘You shall not eat from it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die’.” 
GEN.3.4	But the serpent said to the woman, “You shall not surely die. 
GEN.3.5	For God knows that on the day you both eat from it, then your eyes will be opened and you both shall be like gods,
GEN.3.6	When
GEN.3.7	Then
GEN.3.8	Then
GEN.3.9	And Yahweh God called to the man
GEN.3.10	And he replied,
GEN.3.11	Then he
GEN.3.12	And the man
GEN.3.13	Then
GEN.3.14	Then
GEN.3.14	“Because you have done this, 
GEN.3.14	you will be cursed 
GEN.3.14	more than any domesticated animal 
GEN.3.14	and more than any wild animal.
GEN.3.14	On your belly you shall go 
GEN.3.14	and dust you shall eat 
GEN.3.14	all the days of your life. 
GEN.3.15	And I will put hostility 
GEN.3.15	between you and between the woman, 
GEN.3.15	and between your offspring
GEN.3.15	he will strike you on the head, 
GEN.3.15	and you will strike him on the heel.” 
GEN.3.16	To the woman he said, 
GEN.3.16	“I will greatly increase 
GEN.3.16	your pain in childbearing;
GEN.3.16	in pain you shall bear children. 
GEN.3.16	And to your husband shall be your desire. 
GEN.3.16	And he shall rule over you.” 
GEN.3.17	And to Adam
GEN.3.17	the ground shall be cursed on your account. 
GEN.3.17	In pain you shall eat from it 
GEN.3.17	all the days of your life. 
GEN.3.18	And thorns and thistles shall sprout for you, 
GEN.3.18	and you shall eat the plants of the field. 
GEN.3.19	By the sweat of your brow
GEN.3.19	you shall eat bread, 
GEN.3.19	until your return to the ground. 
GEN.3.19	For from it you were taken; 
GEN.3.19	for you are dust, 
GEN.3.19	and to dust you shall return.” 
GEN.3.20	And the man
GEN.3.21	And Yahweh God made for Adam
GEN.3.22	And Yahweh God said, “Look—the man has become as one of us, to know good and evil. What if
GEN.3.23	And Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. 
GEN.3.24	So
GEN.4.1	Now Adam knew
GEN.4.2	Then she bore
GEN.4.3	And in the course of time
GEN.4.4	and Abel also brought an offering from the choicest firstlings of his flock.
GEN.4.5	but to Cain and to his offering he did not look with favor. And Cain became very angry, and his face fell. 
GEN.4.6	And Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why is your face fallen? 
GEN.4.7	If you do well will I not accept you?
GEN.4.8	Then
GEN.4.9	Then
GEN.4.10	And he said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground. 
GEN.4.11	So now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive the blood of your brother from your hand. 
GEN.4.12	When you till the ground it shall no longer yield its strength to you.
GEN.4.13	And Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is greater than I can bear. 
GEN.4.14	Look, you have driven me out today from the face of the ground, and from your face I must hide. I will be a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth, and it will happen that whoever finds me will kill me.” 
GEN.4.15	Then
GEN.4.16	And Cain went out from the presence of Yahweh, and he settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden. 
GEN.4.17	And Cain knew
GEN.4.18	And to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech. 
GEN.4.19	And Lamech took to himself two wives.
GEN.4.20	And Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and those who have livestock. 
GEN.4.21	And the name of his brother was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and wind instruments. 
GEN.4.22	Then
GEN.4.23	Then
GEN.4.23	“Adah and Zillah, listen to my voice; 
GEN.4.23	O wives of Lamech, hear my words. 
GEN.4.23	I have killed a man for wounding me, 
GEN.4.23	Even a young man for injuring me. 
GEN.4.24	If Cain is avenged sevenfold, 
GEN.4.24	Then Lamech will be avenged seventy and seven times. 
GEN.4.25	Then
GEN.4.26	And as for Seth, he also fathered a son, and he called his name Enosh. At that time he
GEN.5.1	This is the record of the generations
GEN.5.2	Male and female he created them. And he blessed them. And he called their name “Humankind” when
GEN.5.3	And when Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he fathered a child in his likeness, according to his image. And he called his name Seth. 
GEN.5.4	And the days of Adam after he fathered Seth were eight hundred years. And he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.5	And all the days of Adam which he lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died. 
GEN.5.6	When
GEN.5.7	And after Seth had fathered Enosh he lived eight hundred and seven years, and fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.8	And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died. 
GEN.5.9	When
GEN.5.10	And after Enosh fathered Kenan he lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.11	And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, and he died. 
GEN.5.12	When
GEN.5.13	And after Kenan had fathered Mahalalel, he lived eight hundred and forty years, and fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.14	And all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died. 
GEN.5.15	When
GEN.5.16	And after Mahalalel had fathered Jared, he lived eight hundred and thirty years, and fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.17	And all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died. 
GEN.5.18	When
GEN.5.19	And after Jared had fathered Enoch, he lived eight hundred years, and fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.20	And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died. 
GEN.5.21	When
GEN.5.22	And Enoch walked with God after he fathered Methuselah three hundred years, and fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.23	And all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years. 
GEN.5.24	And Enoch walked with God, and he was no more, for God took him. 
GEN.5.25	When
GEN.5.26	And after Methuselah had fathered Lamech, he lived seven hundred and eighty-two years, and fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.27	And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died. 
GEN.5.28	When
GEN.5.29	And he called his name Noah, saying, “This one shall relieve us
GEN.5.30	And after Lamech had fathered Noah he lived five hundred and ninety-five years, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.31	All the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died. 
GEN.5.32	When
GEN.6.1	And it happened that, when humankind began to multiply on the face of the ground, daughters were born to them. 
GEN.6.2	Then
GEN.6.3	And Yahweh said, “My Spirit shall not abide with humankind forever in that he is also flesh. And his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.” 
GEN.6.4	The Nephilim were upon the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God went into the daughters of humankind, and they bore children to them. 
GEN.6.5	And Yahweh saw that the evil of humankind was great upon the earth, and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was always
GEN.6.6	And Yahweh regretted that he had made humankind on the earth, and he was grieved in his heart.
GEN.6.7	And Yahweh said, “I will destroy humankind whom I created from upon the face of the earth, from humankind, to animals, to creeping things, and to the birds of heaven,
GEN.6.8	But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh. 
GEN.6.9	These are the generations
GEN.6.10	And Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
GEN.6.11	And the earth was corrupted before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 
GEN.6.12	And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth. 
GEN.6.13	And God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth was filled with violence because of them. Now, look, I am going to destroy them along with the earth. 
GEN.6.14	Make for yourself an ark of cypress wood; you must make the ark with rooms, then
GEN.6.15	And this is how you must make it: the length of the ark, three hundred cubits; its width fifty cubits; its height, thirty cubits. 
GEN.6.16	You must make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above.
GEN.6.17	And I, behold, I am about to bring the flood waters over the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life from under the heaven;
GEN.6.18	And I will establish my covenant with you, and you must go into the ark—you, and your sons, and your wife, and the wives of your sons with you. 
GEN.6.19	And of every living thing, from all flesh, you must bring two from every kind into the ark to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female. 
GEN.6.20	From the birds according to their
GEN.6.21	And as for you, take for yourself from every kind of food that is eaten. And you must gather it to yourself. And it shall be for you and for them for food.” 
GEN.6.22	And Noah did according to all that God commanded him; thus he did. 
GEN.7.1	 Then
GEN.7.2	From all the clean animals you must take for yourself seven pairs,
GEN.7.3	as well as from the birds of heaven
GEN.7.4	For within seven days
GEN.7.5	And Noah did according to all that Yahweh commanded him. 
GEN.7.6	Noah was six hundred years old
GEN.7.7	And Noah and his sons and his wife, and the wives of his sons with him, went into the ark because of the waters of the flood. 
GEN.7.8	Of clean animals, and of animals which are not clean, and of the birds, and everything that creeps upon the ground, 
GEN.7.9	two of each
GEN.7.10	And it happened that after seven days the waters of the flood came over the earth. 
GEN.7.11	In the six hundredth year of the life of Noah, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month—on that day all the springs of the great deep were split open, and the windows of heaven were opened. 
GEN.7.12	And the rain came upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 
GEN.7.13	On this same day, Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and the wife of Noah and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark, 
GEN.7.14	they and all the living creatures according to their
GEN.7.15	And they came to Noah to the ark, two of each,
GEN.7.16	And those that came, male and female, of every living thing, came as God had commanded him. And Yahweh shut the door behind him. 
GEN.7.17	And the flood came forty days and forty nights upon the earth. And the waters increased, and lifted the ark, and it rose up from the earth. 
GEN.7.18	And the waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth. And the ark went upon the surface
GEN.7.19	And the waters prevailed overwhelmingly
GEN.7.20	The waters swelled fifteen cubits above the mountains, covering them.
GEN.7.21	And every living thing that moved on the earth perished—the birds, and the domesticated animals, and the wild animals, and everything that swarmed on the earth, and all humankind. 
GEN.7.22	Everything in whose nostrils was the breath of life,
GEN.7.23	And he
GEN.7.24	And the waters prevailed over the earth one hundred and fifty days. 
GEN.8.1	And God remembered Noah and all the wild animals, and all the domesticated animals that were with him in the ark. And God caused a wind to blow
GEN.8.2	And the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens
GEN.8.3	And the waters receded from the earth gradually,
GEN.8.4	And the ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat. 
GEN.8.5	And the waters continued to recede
GEN.8.6	And it happened that at the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made. 
GEN.8.7	And he sent out a
GEN.8.8	And he sent out a
GEN.8.9	But the dove did not find a resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the earth. And he stretched out his hand and took her, and brought her to himself into the ark. 
GEN.8.10	And he waited another seven days, and again he sent out
GEN.8.11	And the dove came to him in the evening,
GEN.8.12	And he waited seven more days,
GEN.8.13	And it happened that, in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the waters dried up from upon the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked. And behold, the face of the ground was dried up. 
GEN.8.14	And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry. 
GEN.8.15	And God spoke to Noah, saying: 
GEN.8.16	“Go out from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons, and your sons’ wives with you. 
GEN.8.17	Bring out with you all the living things which are with you, from all the living creatures—birds, and animals, and everything that creeps on the earth, and let them swarm on the earth and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.” 
GEN.8.18	So
GEN.8.19	Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, and everything that moves upon the earth, according to its families, went out from the ark. 
GEN.8.20	And Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and he took from all the clean animals and from all the clean birds, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 
GEN.8.21	And Yahweh smelled the soothing fragrance, and Yahweh said to himself,
GEN.8.22	As long as the earth endures,
GEN.9.1	And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. 
GEN.9.2	And fear of you and dread of you shall be upon every animal of the earth, and on every bird of heaven,
GEN.9.3	Every moving thing that lives shall be for you as food. As I gave the green plants to you, I have now given you everything. 
GEN.9.4	Only you shall not eat raw flesh with blood in it.
GEN.9.5	And
GEN.9.6	“As for the one shedding the blood of humankind, 
GEN.9.6	by humankind his blood shall be shed, 
GEN.9.6	for God made humankind in his own image. 
GEN.9.7	“And you, be fruitful and multiply, swarm on the earth and multiply in it.” 
GEN.9.8	And God said to Noah and to his sons with him, 
GEN.9.9	“As for me, behold, I am establishing my covenant with you and with your seed after you, 
GEN.9.10	and with every living creature that is with you—the birds, the animals, and every animal of the earth with you, from all that came out of the ark to all the animals of the earth. 
GEN.9.11	I am establishing my covenant with you, that never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, nor will there ever be a flood that destroys the earth.” 
GEN.9.12	And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant that I am making between me and you, and between every living creature that is with you for future generations. 
GEN.9.13	My bow I have set in the clouds, and it shall be for a sign of the covenant between me and between the earth. 
GEN.9.14	And when I make clouds appear over the earth the bow shall be seen in the clouds. 
GEN.9.15	Then
GEN.9.16	The bow shall be in the clouds, and I will see it, so as to remember the everlasting covenant between God and between every living creature, with all flesh that is upon the earth.” 
GEN.9.17	And God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant which I am establishing between me and all flesh that is upon the earth. 
GEN.9.18	Now
GEN.9.19	These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated.
GEN.9.20	And Noah began to be a man of the ground, and he planted a vineyard. 
GEN.9.21	And he drank some of the wine and became drunk, and he exposed himself in the midst of his tent. 
GEN.9.22	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and he told his two brothers outside. 
GEN.9.23	Then
GEN.9.24	Then
GEN.9.25	And he said, 
GEN.9.25	“Cursed be Canaan, 
GEN.9.25	a slave of slaves he shall be to his brothers.” 
GEN.9.26	Then
GEN.9.26	“Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem, 
GEN.9.26	and let Canaan be a slave to them. 
GEN.9.27	May God make space for Japheth, 
GEN.9.27	and let him dwell in the tents of Shem, 
GEN.9.27	and let Canaan be a slave for him.” 
GEN.9.28	And Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood. 
GEN.9.29	And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died. 
GEN.10.1	These are the generations
GEN.10.2	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 
GEN.10.3	And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 
GEN.10.4	And the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 
GEN.10.5	From these the coastland peoples spread out through their lands, each according to his own language by their own families, in their nations. 
GEN.10.6	And the sons of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan. 
GEN.10.7	And the sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. 
GEN.10.8	And Cush fathered Nimrod. He was the first on earth to be a mighty warrior.
GEN.10.9	He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. Therefore it was said, “Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Yahweh.” 
GEN.10.10	Now,
GEN.10.11	From that land he went out to Assyria, and he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, 
GEN.10.12	Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city. 
GEN.10.13	And Egypt fathered Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 
GEN.10.14	Pathrusim, and Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim. 
GEN.10.15	Canaan fathered Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth, 
GEN.10.16	and the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, 
GEN.10.17	the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 
GEN.10.18	the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad. 
GEN.10.19	And the territory of the Canaanites was from Sidon in the direction of
GEN.10.20	These are the descendants
GEN.10.21	And to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the older brother of Japheth, children were also born. 
GEN.10.22	The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. 
GEN.10.23	And the sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 
GEN.10.24	And Arphaxad fathered Shelah, and Shelah fathered Eber. 
GEN.10.25	And to Eber two sons were born. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided, and the name of his brother was Joktan. 
GEN.10.26	And Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
GEN.10.27	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
GEN.10.28	Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
GEN.10.29	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan. 
GEN.10.30	And their dwelling place extended from
GEN.10.31	These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands, and according to their nations. 
GEN.10.32	These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations
GEN.11.1	Now
GEN.11.2	And as people migrated
GEN.11.3	And they said to each other,
GEN.11.4	And they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower whose top reaches to the heavens. And let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth.” 
GEN.11.5	Then
GEN.11.6	And Yahweh said, “Behold, they are one people with one language,
GEN.11.7	Come, let us go down and confuse their language there, so that they will not understand each other’s language.”
GEN.11.8	So Yahweh scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth, and they stopped building the city. 
GEN.11.9	Therefore its name was called Babel, for there Yahweh confused the language of the whole earth, and there Yahweh scattered them over the face of the whole earth. 
GEN.11.10	These are the generations
GEN.11.11	And Shem lived five hundred years after he fathered Arphaxad, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.12	When Arphaxad had lived thirty-five years, he fathered Shelah. 
GEN.11.13	And Arphaxad lived four hundred and three years after he fathered Shelah, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.14	When Shelah had lived thirty years, he fathered Eber. 
GEN.11.15	And Shelah lived four hundred and three years after he fathered Eber, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.16	When Eber had lived thirty-four years, he fathered Peleg. 
GEN.11.17	And Eber lived four hundred and thirty years after he fathered Peleg, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.18	When Peleg had lived thirty years, he fathered Reu. 
GEN.11.19	And Peleg lived two hundred and nine years after he fathered Reu, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.20	When Reu had lived thirty-two years, he fathered Serug. 
GEN.11.21	And Reu lived two hundred and seven years after he fathered Serug, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.22	When Serug had lived thirty years, he fathered Nahor. 
GEN.11.23	And Serug lived two hundred years after he fathered Nahor, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.24	When Nahor had lived twenty-nine years, he fathered Terah. 
GEN.11.25	And Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years after he fathered Terah, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.26	When Terah had lived seventy years, he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 
GEN.11.27	Now
GEN.11.28	And Haran died in the presence of Terah his father in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 
GEN.11.29	And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of the wife of Abram was Sarai, and the name of the wife of Nahor was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah. 
GEN.11.30	And Sarai was barren; she had no child. 
GEN.11.31	And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, his grandson,
GEN.11.32	And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran. 
GEN.12.1	And Yahweh said to Abram, “Go out from your land and from your relatives, and from the house of your father, to the land that I will show you. 
GEN.12.2	And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great. And you will be a blessing. 
GEN.12.3	And I will bless those who bless you, and those who curse you I will curse. And all families of the earth will be blessed in you.” 
GEN.12.4	And Abram went out as Yahweh had told him, and Lot went with him. Now Abram was seventy-five years old
GEN.12.5	And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his nephew,
GEN.12.6	And Abram traveled through the land up to the place of Shechem, to the Oak of Moreh. Now the Canaanites were in the land at that time. 
GEN.12.7	And Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” And he built an altar there to Yahweh, who had appeared to him. 
GEN.12.8	And he moved on from there to the hill country, east of Bethel. And he pitched his tent at Bethel on the west, and at Ai on the east. And he built an altar there to Yahweh. And he called on the name of Yahweh. 
GEN.12.9	And Abram kept moving on,
GEN.12.10	And there was a famine in the land. And Abram went down to Egypt to dwell as an alien there, for the famine was severe in the land. 
GEN.12.11	And it happened that as he drew near to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “Look now, I know that you are a woman beautiful of appearance, 
GEN.12.12	and it shall happen that, if the Egyptians see you, then they will say, ‘This is his wife,’ then they will kill me but let you live. 
GEN.12.13	Please say you are my sister so that it will go well for me on your account. Then I will live
GEN.12.14	And it happened that as Abram came into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful. 
GEN.12.15	And the officials of Pharaoh saw her, and they praised her beauty to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken to the house of Pharaoh. 
GEN.12.16	And he dealt well with Abram on account of her, and he had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels. 
GEN.12.17	Then
GEN.12.18	Then Pharaoh called for Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? 
GEN.12.19	Why did you say ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to myself as a wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go.” 
GEN.12.20	And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him, and then sent him and his wife and all that was with him away. 
GEN.13.1	Then Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that was with him. And Lot went with him to the Negev. 
GEN.13.2	Now Abram was very wealthy in livestock, in silver, and in gold. 
GEN.13.3	And he went according to his journey from the Negev, then to Bethel, to the place where his tent was at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 
GEN.13.4	to the place where he had made an altar at the beginning. And Abram called on the name of Yahweh there. 
GEN.13.5	And Lot, who went with Abram, also had herds and tents. 
GEN.13.6	And the land could not support them
GEN.13.7	And there was a quarrel between the herdsmen of the livestock of Abram and the herdsmen of the livestock of Lot. Now at that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land. 
GEN.13.8	Then Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there not be quarreling between me and you, and between my shepherds and your shepherds, for we men are brothers. 
GEN.13.9	Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you want what is on the left, then I will go right; if you want what is on the right, I will go left.” 
GEN.13.10	And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw the whole plain of the Jordan, that all of it was well-watered land—this was before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah—like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt in the direction of
GEN.13.11	So
GEN.13.12	Abram settled in the land of Canaan, and Lot settled in the cities of the plain. And he pitched his tent toward Sodom. 
GEN.13.13	Now the men of Sodom were extremely wicked sinners against Yahweh.
GEN.13.14	And Yahweh said to Abram after Lot had separated from him, “Now, lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are to the north, and to the south, and to the east and to the west, 
GEN.13.15	for all the land which you see I will give to you, and to your descendants, forever. 
GEN.13.16	I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth which, if anyone were able to count the dust of the earth, your descendants would be so counted. 
GEN.13.17	Arise, go through the length of the land and through its breadth, for I will give it to you.” 
GEN.13.18	So
GEN.14.1	And it happened that in the days of Amraphel, the king of Shinar, Arioch, the king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer, the king of Elam, and Tidal, the king of Goiim, 
GEN.14.2	made war with Bera, the king of Sodom, and Birsha, the king of Gomorrah, Shinab, the king of Admah, and Shemeber, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). 
GEN.14.3	All these joined forces at the valley of Siddim (that is, the sea of the salt). 
GEN.14.4	Twelve years they had served Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
GEN.14.5	In the fourteenth year Kedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-Kiriathaim, 
GEN.14.6	And the Horites in their hill country of Seir, as far as El-Paran, which is at the wilderness. 
GEN.14.7	Then
GEN.14.8	Then
GEN.14.9	with Kedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim, and Amraphel, king of Shinar, and Arioch, king of Ellasar, four kings against five. 
GEN.14.10	Now
GEN.14.11	So
GEN.14.12	And they
GEN.14.13	Then
GEN.14.14	When
GEN.14.15	And he divided his trained men against them at night, he and his servants. And he defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, which is north of Damascus. 
GEN.14.16	And he brought back all the possessions. And he also brought back Lot, his relative,
GEN.14.17	After his return from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the Valley of the King). 
GEN.14.18	And Melchizedek, the king of Salem, brought out bread and wine. (He was the priest of God Most High). 
GEN.14.19	And he blessed him and said, 
GEN.14.19	“Blessed be Abram by God Most High, 
GEN.14.19	Maker of heaven and earth. 
GEN.14.20	And blessed be God Most High 
GEN.14.20	who delivered your enemies into your hand.” 
GEN.14.20	And he
GEN.14.21	And the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, but the possessions take for yourself.” 
GEN.14.22	And Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have raised my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth, 
GEN.14.23	that neither a thread nor
GEN.14.24	Nothing besides what
GEN.15.1	After these things the word of Yahweh came
GEN.15.2	Then
GEN.15.3	And Abram said, “Look, you have not given me a descendant, and here, a member of my household
GEN.15.4	And behold, the word of Yahweh came to him saying, “This person will not be your heir,
GEN.15.5	And he brought him outside and said, “Look toward the heavens and count the stars if you are able to count them.” And he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.” 
GEN.15.6	And he believed in Yahweh, and he reckoned it to him as righteousness. 
GEN.15.7	And he said to him, “I am Yahweh, who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give this land to you, to possess it.” 
GEN.15.8	And he said, “O Yahweh God, how shall I know that I will possess it?” 
GEN.15.9	And he said to him, “Take for me a three-year-old heifer, and a three-year-old female goat, and a three-year-old ram, and a turtledove and a young pigeon.” 
GEN.15.10	And he took for him all these and cut them in pieces down the middle. And he put each piece opposite the other,
GEN.15.11	And the birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. 
GEN.15.12	And it happened that, as the sun went down,
GEN.15.13	And he said to Abram, “You must surely know
GEN.15.14	And also that the nation which they
GEN.15.15	And as for you, you shall go to your ancestors
GEN.15.16	And the fourth generation shall return here, for the guilt of the Amorites is not yet complete.”
GEN.15.17	And after the sun had gone down and it was dusk, behold, a smoking firepot and a flaming torch passed between those half pieces. 
GEN.15.18	On that day Yahweh made
GEN.15.19	the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 
GEN.15.20	the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, 
GEN.15.21	the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.” 
GEN.16.1	Now
GEN.16.2	And Sarai said to Abram, “Look, please, Yahweh has prevented me from bearing children. Please go in to my servant; perhaps I will have children by her.”
GEN.16.3	Then
GEN.16.4	And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she
GEN.16.5	And Sarai said to Abram, “may my harm be upon you. I had my servant sleep with you,
GEN.16.6	And Abram said to Sarai, “Look, your servant is under your authority.
GEN.16.7	And the angel of Yahweh found her at a spring of water in the wilderness, at the spring by the road of Shur. 
GEN.16.8	And he said to Hagar, the servant of Sarai, “From where
GEN.16.9	Then
GEN.16.10	And the angel of Yahweh said to her, “I will greatly multiply
GEN.16.11	And the angel of Yahweh said to her: 
GEN.16.11	“Behold, you are pregnant 
GEN.16.11	and shall have a son. 
GEN.16.11	And you shall call his name Ishmael, 
GEN.16.11	for Yahweh has listened to your suffering. 
GEN.16.12	And he shall be a wild donkey of a man, 
GEN.16.12	his hand will be against everyone, 
GEN.16.12	and the hand of everyone will be against him, 
GEN.16.12	and he will live in hostility with all his brothers.”
GEN.16.13	So
GEN.16.14	Therefore the well was called Beer-Lahai-Roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. 
GEN.16.15	And Hagar had a child for Abram, a son. And Abram called the name of his son whom Hagar bore to him, Ishmael. 
GEN.16.16	And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram. 
GEN.17.1	When
GEN.17.2	so that
GEN.17.3	Then Abram fell upon his face and God spoke with him, saying, 
GEN.17.4	“As for me, behold, my covenant shall be with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations. 
GEN.17.5	Your name shall no longer be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I will make you the father of a multitude of nations. 
GEN.17.6	And I will make you exceedingly
GEN.17.7	And I will establish my covenant between me and you, and between your offspring after you, throughout their generations as an everlasting covenant to be as God for you and to your offspring after you. 
GEN.17.8	And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land in which you are living as an alien,
GEN.17.9	And God said to Abraham, “Now as for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you, throughout their generations. 
GEN.17.10	This is my covenant which you shall keep, between me and you, and also with
GEN.17.11	And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you. 
GEN.17.12	And at eight days of age
GEN.17.13	You must certainly circumcise
GEN.17.14	And as for any uncircumcised male who has not circumcised the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his
GEN.17.15	And God said to Abraham, “as for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, for Sarah shall be her name. 
GEN.17.16	And I will bless her; moreover, I give to you from her a son. And I will bless her, and she shall give rise to nations.
GEN.17.17	And Abraham fell upon his face and laughed. And he said in his heart, “Can a child be born to a man a hundred years old,
GEN.17.18	And Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before you!” 
GEN.17.19	And God said, “No, but Sarah your wife shall bear a son for you, and you shall call his name Isaac. And I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant to his offspring after him. 
GEN.17.20	And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I will bless him and I will make him fruitful, and I will multiply him exceedingly.
GEN.17.21	But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this appointed time next year.” 
GEN.17.22	When
GEN.17.23	And Abraham took Ishmael his son and all who were born of his house, and all those acquired by his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on the same day that God spoke with him. 
GEN.17.24	Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin. 
GEN.17.25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin. 
GEN.17.26	Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised on the same day. 
GEN.17.27	And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those acquired by money from a foreigner,
GEN.18.1	And Yahweh appeared to him
GEN.18.2	And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, three men were standing near
GEN.18.3	And he said, “My lord, if I have found favor in your eyes do not pass by your servant. 
GEN.18.4	Let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and rest under the tree. 
GEN.18.5	And let me bring a piece of bread, then
GEN.18.6	Then
GEN.18.7	And Abraham ran to the cattle and took a calf,
GEN.18.8	Then he took curds and milk, and the calf which he prepared, and set it before them. And he was standing by them under the tree while
GEN.18.9	And they said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” And he said, “Here, in the tent.” 
GEN.18.10	And he
GEN.18.11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age;
GEN.18.12	So
GEN.18.13	Then Yahweh said to Abraham, “What is this that Sarah laughed, saying, ‘Is it indeed true that I will bear a child, now that I have grown old?’ 
GEN.18.14	Is anything too difficult for Yahweh? At the appointed time I will return to you in the spring
GEN.18.15	But Sarah denied it, saying, “I did not laugh,” because she was afraid. He
GEN.18.16	Then the men set out from there, and they looked down upon Sodom. And Abraham went with them to send them on their way.
GEN.18.17	Then Yahweh said, “Shall I conceal from Abraham what I am going to do? 
GEN.18.18	Abraham will surely become a great and strong nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed on account of him. 
GEN.18.19	For I have chosen
GEN.18.20	Then Yahweh said, “Because the outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very serious,
GEN.18.21	I will go down and I will see. Have they done altogether according to its cry of distress which has come to me? If not, I will know.” 
GEN.18.22	And the men turned from there and went toward Sodom. And Abraham was still standing before Yahweh. 
GEN.18.23	And Abraham drew near to Yahweh and said, “Will you also sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 
GEN.18.24	If perhaps there are fifty righteous in the midst of the city, will you also sweep them away and not forgive the place on account of the fifty righteous in her midst? 
GEN.18.25	Far be it from you to do such a thing as this, to kill the righteous with the wicked, that
GEN.18.26	And Yahweh said, “If I find fifty righteous in Sodom, in the midst of the city, then I will forgive the whole place for their sake.” 
GEN.18.27	Then Abraham answered and said, “Look, please, I was bold to speak to my Lord, but I am dust and ashes. 
GEN.18.28	Perhaps the fifty righteous are lacking five—will you destroy the whole city on account of the five?” And he answered, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.” 
GEN.18.29	And once again he spoke
GEN.18.30	And he said, “Please, let not my Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if
GEN.18.31	And he said, “Please, now, I was bold to speak to my Lord. What if
GEN.18.32	And he said, “Please, let not my Lord be angry, and I will speak only once more. What if
GEN.18.33	Then Yahweh left,
GEN.19.1	And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening. And Lot was sitting in the gateway of Sodom. Then Lot saw them and stood up to meet them. And he bowed down with his face to the ground. 
GEN.19.2	And he said, “Behold, my lords, please turn aside into the house of your servant and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you can rise early and go on your way.” And they said, “No, but we will spend the night in the square.” 
GEN.19.3	But he urged them strongly,
GEN.19.4	Before they laid down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man,
GEN.19.5	And they called to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may know
GEN.19.6	But Lot went out to them at the entrance, and he shut the door behind him. 
GEN.19.7	And he said, “No, my brothers, please do not do such a wrong thing. 
GEN.19.8	Behold, I have two daughters who have not known
GEN.19.9	But they said, “Step aside!” Then they said, “This fellow
GEN.19.10	Then the men reached out with their hands and brought Lot in to them, into the house, and they shut the door. 
GEN.19.11	And the men who were at the entrance of the house they struck with blindness, both small and great, and they were unable to find the entrance. 
GEN.19.12	Then the men said to Lot, “Who is here with you? Bring out from the place your sons-in-law, and your sons and your daughters, and all who are with you in the city. 
GEN.19.13	For we are about to destroy this place, because their cry has become great before Yahweh. Yahweh sent us to destroy it.” 
GEN.19.14	Then Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law who were taking
GEN.19.15	And as the dawn came up the angels urged Lot saying, “Get up, take your wife and your two daughters who are staying with you,
GEN.19.16	But when he lingered, the men seized him by his hand and his wife’s hand, and his two daughters by hand, on account of the mercy of Yahweh upon him. And they brought him out and set him outside of the city. 
GEN.19.17	And after bringing them outside one said, “Flee for your life; do not look behind you, and do not stand anywhere in the plain. Flee to the mountains lest you be destroyed.” 
GEN.19.18	And Lot said to them, “No, please, my lords. 
GEN.19.19	Behold, your servant has found favor in your eyes and you have shown me great kindness
GEN.19.20	Behold, this city is near enough to flee there, and it is a little one. Please, let me flee there. Is it not a little one? Then my life shall be saved.” 
GEN.19.21	And he said to him, “Behold, I will grant this favor as well;
GEN.19.22	Escape there quickly, for I cannot do this thing until you get there.” Therefore, there name of the city was called Zoar. 
GEN.19.23	After the sun had risen
GEN.19.24	Yahweh rained down from heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Yahweh. 
GEN.19.25	And he overthrew those cities and the whole plain, and the inhabitants of the cities and the vegetation of the ground. 
GEN.19.26	But his
GEN.19.27	And Abraham arose early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before Yahweh. 
GEN.19.28	And he looked down upon the surface of Sodom and Gomorrah, and upon the whole surface of the land, the plain. And he saw that,
GEN.19.29	So it was, when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out from the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived. 
GEN.19.30	And Lot went out from Zoar and settled in the hill country
GEN.19.31	And the firstborn daughter said to the younger one, “Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to come in to us according to the manner of all the land. 
GEN.19.32	Come, let us give our father wine to drink and let us lie with him
GEN.19.33	And they gave their father wine to drink that night, and the firstborn went and lay with her father, but he did not know when she lay down or when she got up. 
GEN.19.34	And it happened that, the next day the firstborn said to the younger one, “Look, I laid with my father last night. Let us give him wine to drink also tonight, then go and lie with him that we may secure descendants through our father.”
GEN.19.35	And they gave their father wine to drink again that night, and the younger got up and lay with him, but he did not know when she lay down or when she got up. 
GEN.19.36	And the two daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father. 
GEN.19.37	The firstborn gave birth to a son, and she called his name Moab. He is the father of Moab until this day. 
GEN.19.38	And the younger, she also gave birth to a son, and she called his name Ben-Ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites
GEN.20.1	And Abraham journeyed from there to the land of the Negev, and he settled between Kadesh and Shur. And he dwelled as an alien in Gerar. 
GEN.20.2	And Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. 
GEN.20.3	And God came to Abimelech in a dream at night. And he said to him, “Look, you are a dead man on account of the woman you have taken. For she is a married woman.”
GEN.20.4	Now Abimelech had not approached her, so he said, “my Lord, will you even kill a righteous people?” 
GEN.20.5	Did not he himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ With integrity of my heart and with cleanness of my hands I did this.” 
GEN.20.6	Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes,
GEN.20.7	So now, return the wife of the man, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you and you will live. And if you do not return her,
GEN.20.8	So Abimelech rose early in the morning. And he called all his servants and told them all these things,
GEN.20.9	And Abimelech called for Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you that you brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? You have done things to me that should not be done.” 
GEN.20.10	And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What were you thinking
GEN.20.11	And Abraham said, “Because I thought, surely there is no fear of God in this place; they will kill me on account of the matter of my wife. 
GEN.20.12	Besides,
GEN.20.13	And it happened that as God caused me to wander from the house of my father I said to her, ‘This is your loyal kindness that you must do for me at every place where we come: say concerning me, “He is my brother.” ’ ” 
GEN.20.14	And Abimelech took sheep and cattle and male slaves and female slaves, and he gave them to Abraham. And he returned Sarah his wife to him. 
GEN.20.15	And Abimelech said, “Here is my land before you; settle where it pleases you.”
GEN.20.16	And to Sarah he said, “Look, I have given a thousand pieces of silver to your brother. It shall be an exoneration.
GEN.20.17	And Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his female servants so that they could bear children again. 
GEN.20.18	For Yahweh had completely closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of the matter of Sarah, the wife of Abraham. 
GEN.21.1	And Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said. And Yahweh did to Sarah as he had promised. 
GEN.21.2	And she conceived, and Sarah bore to Abraham a son in his old age at the appointed time that God had told him. 
GEN.21.3	And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. 
GEN.21.4	And Abraham circumcised Isaac his son when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. 
GEN.21.5	And Abraham was one hundred years old when Isaac his son was born to him. 
GEN.21.6	And Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; all who hear will laugh for me.” 
GEN.21.7	And she said, “Who would announce to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne a son to Abraham in his old age.” 
GEN.21.8	And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned. 
GEN.21.9	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne Abraham, mocking. 
GEN.21.10	Then she said to Abraham, “Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman will not be heir with my son, with Isaac.” 
GEN.21.11	And the matter displeased Abraham very much
GEN.21.12	Then God said to Abraham, “Do not be displeased
GEN.21.13	And I will also make the son of the slave woman into a nation, for he is your offspring.” 
GEN.21.14	Then Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder. And he sent her away with the child, and she went, wandering about in the wilderness, in Beersheba. 
GEN.21.15	And when the water was finished from the skin, she put the child under one of the bushes. 
GEN.21.16	And she went and she sat a good distance away,
GEN.21.17	And God heard the cry
GEN.21.18	Get up, take up the boy and take him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.” 
GEN.21.19	And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave a drink to the boy. 
GEN.21.20	And God was with the boy, and he grew and lived in the wilderness. And he became an expert with a bow.
GEN.21.21	And he lived in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt. 
GEN.21.22	And it happened that at that time, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham, “God is with you, in all that you do. 
GEN.21.23	So now, swear to me here by God that you will not deal with me falsely, or with my descendants, or my posterity. According to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall pledge to do with me and with the land where you have dwelled as an alien.” 
GEN.21.24	And Abraham said, “I swear.” 
GEN.21.25	Then Abraham complained to Abimelech on account of the well of water that servants of Abimelech had seized. 
GEN.21.26	And Abimelech said, “I do not know who did this thing, neither did you tell me, nor have I heard of it except for today.” 
GEN.21.27	And Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech. And the two of them made
GEN.21.28	Then Abraham set off seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves. 
GEN.21.29	And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe-lambs that you have set off by themselves?” 
GEN.21.30	And he said, “You shall take the seven ewe-lambs from my hand as proof on my behalf
GEN.21.31	Therefore that place is called Beersheba, because there the two of them swore an oath. 
GEN.21.32	And they made
GEN.21.33	And he
GEN.21.34	And Abraham dwelled as an alien in the land of the Philistines many days. 
GEN.22.1	And it happened that after these things, God tested Abraham. And he said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 
GEN.22.2	And he said, “Take your son, your only child, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains where
GEN.22.3	And Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his donkey. And he took two of his servants with him, and Isaac his son. And he chopped wood for a burnt offering. And he got up and went to the place which God had told him. 
GEN.22.4	On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and he saw the place at a distance. 
GEN.22.5	And Abraham said to his servants, “You stay here with the donkey, and I and the boy will go up there. We will worship, then we will return to you.” 
GEN.22.6	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and placed it on Isaac his son. And he took the fire in his hand and the knife, and the two of them went together. 
GEN.22.7	And Isaac said to Abraham his father, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” And he said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” 
GEN.22.8	And Abraham said, “God will provide
GEN.22.9	And they came to the place that God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood. Then he bound Isaac his son and placed him on the altar atop the wood. 
GEN.22.10	And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. 
GEN.22.11	And the angel of Yahweh called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham! Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 
GEN.22.12	And he said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the boy; do not do anything to him. For now I know that you are one who fears
GEN.22.13	And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked. And behold, a ram was caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son. 
GEN.22.14	And Abraham called the name of that place “Yahweh will provide,”
GEN.22.15	And the angel of Yahweh called to Abraham a second time from heaven. 
GEN.22.16	And he said, “I swear by myself, declares Yahweh, that because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only child, 
GEN.22.17	that I will certainly bless you and greatly multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the shore of the sea. And your offspring will take possession of the gate of his enemies. 
GEN.22.18	All the nations of the earth will be blessed through your offspring, because you have listened to my voice.” 
GEN.22.19	And Abraham returned to his servants, and they got up and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived in Beersheba. 
GEN.22.20	And it happened that after these things, it was told to Abraham, “Look, Milcah has also borne children to your brother Nahor: 
GEN.22.21	Uz his firstborn and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, 
GEN.22.22	and Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” 
GEN.22.23	(Now, Bethuel fathered Rebekah). These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, the brother of Abraham. 
GEN.22.24	And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah. 
GEN.23.1	And Sarah lived
GEN.23.2	And Sarah died in Kiriath Arba; that is Hebron, in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.23.3	And Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. And Abraham rose up from his dead, and he spoke to the Hittites
GEN.23.4	“I am a stranger and an alien among you; give to me my own burial site
GEN.23.5	And the Hittites
GEN.23.6	“Hear us, my lord, you are a mighty prince
GEN.23.7	And Abraham rose up and bowed to the people of the land, to the Hittites.
GEN.23.8	And he spoke with them, saying, “If you are willing
GEN.23.9	that he may sell
GEN.23.10	Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites.
GEN.23.11	“No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field and the cave which is in it, I also give it to you in the sight of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.” 
GEN.23.12	And Abraham bowed before the people of the land. 
GEN.23.13	And he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, “If only you will hear me
GEN.23.14	And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, 
GEN.23.15	“My lord, hear me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver—what is that between me and you? Bury your dead.” 
GEN.23.16	Then Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed for Ephron the silver that he had named
GEN.23.17	So the field of Ephron which was in the Machpelah, which was near Mamre—the field and the cave which was in it, with all the trees that were in the field, which were within all its surrounding boundaries—passed
GEN.23.18	to Abraham as a property in the presence of the Hittites,
GEN.23.19	And thus afterward Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah near Mamre; that is Hebron, in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.23.20	And the field and the cave which was in it passed
GEN.24.1	Now Abraham was old, advanced in age,
GEN.24.2	And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his house, who had charge of all he had, “Please put your hand under my thigh 
GEN.24.3	that I may make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose midst I am dwelling, 
GEN.24.4	but that you will go to my land and to my family, and take a wife for my son, for Isaac.” 
GEN.24.5	And the servant said to him, “Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow
GEN.24.6	Abraham said to him, “You must take care
GEN.24.7	Yahweh, the God of heaven who took me from the house of my father and from the land of my family, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, ‘to your offspring I will give this land,’ he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. 
GEN.24.8	And if the woman is not willing to follow
GEN.24.9	Then the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and he swore to him concerning this matter. 
GEN.24.10	And the servant took ten camels from his master’s camels, and he went with all kinds of his master’s good things in his hand. And he arose and went to Aram-Naharaim, to the city of Nahor. 
GEN.24.11	And he made the camels kneel outside the city at the well of water, at the time of evening, toward the time the women went out to draw water.
GEN.24.12	And he said, “O Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show loyal love to my master Abraham. 
GEN.24.13	Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are going out to draw water. 
GEN.24.14	And let it be that the girl to whom I shall say, ‘Please, offer your jar that I may drink’ and who says, ‘Drink—and I will also water your camels,’ she is the one you have chosen for your servant, for Isaac. By her I will know that you have shown loyal love to my master.” 
GEN.24.15	And it happened that before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah—who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, the brother of Abraham—came out, and her jar was on her shoulder. 
GEN.24.16	Now the girl was very pleasing in appearance. She was a virgin; no man had known her. And she went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up. 
GEN.24.17	And the servant ran to meet her. And he said, “Please, let me drink a little of the water from your jar.” 
GEN.24.18	And she said, “Drink, my lord.” And she quickly lowered her jar in her hand and gave him a drink. 
GEN.24.19	When
GEN.24.20	And she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water. And she drew water for all his camels. 
GEN.24.21	And the man was gazing at her silently to know if Yahweh had made his journey successful or not. 
GEN.24.22	And it happened that as the camels finished drinking the man took a gold ring of a half shekel in weight and two bracelets for her arms, ten shekels in weight, 
GEN.24.23	and said, “Please tell me, whose daughter are you? Is there a place at the house of your father for us to spend the night?” 
GEN.24.24	And she said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.” 
GEN.24.25	Then she said to him, “We have both straw and fodder in abundance, as well as a place to spend the night.” 
GEN.24.26	And the man knelt down and worshiped Yahweh. 
GEN.24.27	And he said, “Blessed be Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld
GEN.24.28	Then the girl ran and reported these things to the household of her mother. 
GEN.24.29	Now Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. And Laban ran out to the man toward the spring. 
GEN.24.30	And when he saw the ring and the bracelets on the arms of his sister and heard the words of Rebekah his sister, who said, “Thus the man spoke to me,” he went to the man. And behold, he was standing with the camels at the spring. 
GEN.24.31	And he said, “Come, O blessed one of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? Now I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.” 
GEN.24.32	And the man came to the house and unloaded the camels. And he gave straw and fodder to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 
GEN.24.33	And food was placed before him
GEN.24.34	And he said, “I am the servant of Abraham. 
GEN.24.35	Now Yahweh has blessed my master exceedingly, and he has become great. He has given to him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male slaves and female slaves, and camels and donkeys. 
GEN.24.36	And Sarah, the wife of my master, has borne a son to my master after her old age. And he
GEN.24.37	And my master made me swear, saying, ‘Do not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I am living. 
GEN.24.38	But you shall go to the house of my father, and to my family, and you shall take a wife for my son.’ 
GEN.24.39	And I said to my master, ‘Perhaps the woman will not follow
GEN.24.40	And he said to me, ‘Yahweh, before whom I have walked, shall send his angel with you and will make your journey successful. And you shall take a wife for my son from my family, and from the house of my father. 
GEN.24.41	Then you shall be released from my oath, when you come to my family. And if they will not give a woman to you, then you will be released from my oath.’ 
GEN.24.42	Then today I came to the spring, and I said, ‘O Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, if you would please make my journey successful,
GEN.24.43	Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let it be that the young woman who comes out to draw water and to whom I say, “Please give me a little water to drink from your jar,” 
GEN.24.44	let her say to me, “Drink; I will also draw water for your camels,” she is the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for the son of my master.’ 
GEN.24.45	I had not yet finished speaking to myself
GEN.24.46	And she hastened and let down her jar from her shoulder
GEN.24.47	Then I asked her and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.’ And I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms. 
GEN.24.48	And I knelt down and worshiped Yahweh, and I praised Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who led me on the right way, to take the daughter of the brother of my master for his son. 
GEN.24.49	So now, if you are going to deal loyally and truly
GEN.24.50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered, and they said, “The matter has gone out from Yahweh; we are not able to speak bad or good to you. 
GEN.24.51	Here is Rebekah before you. Take her and go; let her be a wife for the son of your master as Yahweh has spoken.” 
GEN.24.52	And it happened that when the servant of Abraham heard their words he bowed down to the ground to Yahweh. 
GEN.24.53	And the servant brought out silver jewelry and gold jewelry, and garments, and he gave them to Rebekah. And he gave precious gifts to her brother and to her mother. 
GEN.24.54	And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night. And they got up in the morning, and he said, “Let me go to my master.” 
GEN.24.55	And her brother and her mother said, “Let the girl remain with us ten days or so; after that she may go.” 
GEN.24.56	And he said to them, “Do not delay me. Now, Yahweh has made my journey successful. Let me go. I must go to my master.” 
GEN.24.57	And they said, “Let us call the girl and ask her opinion.”
GEN.24.58	And they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.” 
GEN.24.59	So they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and the servant of Abraham and his men. 
GEN.24.60	And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “You are our sister; may you become countless thousands; and may your offspring take possession of the gate of his enemies.” 
GEN.24.61	And Rebekah and her maidservants arose, and they mounted the camels and followed
GEN.24.62	Now Isaac was coming from the direction of Beer-Lahai-Roi. And he was living in the land of the Negev. 
GEN.24.63	And Isaac went out to meditate in the field early in the evening,
GEN.24.64	And Rebekah lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac. And she got down from the camel. 
GEN.24.65	And she said to the servant, “Who is this man walking around in the field to meet us?” And the servant said, “That is my master.” And she took her
GEN.24.66	And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. 
GEN.24.67	And Isaac brought her to the tent of Sarah his mother. And he took Rebekah, and she became his wife. And Isaac loved her and was comforted after the death of his mother. 
GEN.25.1	Now Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Keturah. 
GEN.25.2	And she bore to him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	And Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim. 
GEN.25.4	And the sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah. All of these were the children of Keturah. 
GEN.25.5	And Abraham gave all he had to Isaac. 
GEN.25.6	But to the sons of Abraham’s concubines Abraham gave gifts. And while he was still living he sent them away eastward, away from his son Isaac, to the land of the east. 
GEN.25.7	Now these are the days of the years of the life of Abraham:
GEN.25.8	And Abraham passed away and died in a good old age, old and full of years. And he was gathered to his people. 
GEN.25.9	And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, son of Zohar the Hittite, that was east of Mamre, 
GEN.25.10	the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites.
GEN.25.11	And it happened that after the death of Abraham God blessed Isaac his son, and Isaac settled at Beer-Lahai-Roi. 
GEN.25.12	Now these are the generations
GEN.25.13	And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names according to their family records. The firstborn of Ishmael was Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
GEN.25.14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
GEN.25.16	These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their villages and by their encampments—12 leaders according to their tribes. 
GEN.25.17	Now these are the years of the life of Ishmael: 137 years. And he passed away and died, and was gathered to his people.
GEN.25.18	They settled from Havilah to Shur, which was opposite
GEN.25.19	Now these are the generations
GEN.25.20	And Isaac was forty years old
GEN.25.21	And Isaac prayed to Yahweh on behalf of his wife, for she was barren. And Yahweh responded to his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 
GEN.25.22	And the children in her womb jostled each other, and she said, “If it is going to be like this, why be pregnant?”
GEN.25.23	And Yahweh said to her, “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from birth
GEN.25.24	And when her days to give birth were completed,
GEN.25.25	And the first came out red, all his body
GEN.25.26	And afterward his brother came out, and his hand grasped the heel of Esau, so his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old
GEN.25.27	And the boys grew up. And Esau was a skilled
GEN.25.28	And Isaac loved Esau because he could eat of his game,
GEN.25.29	Once
GEN.25.30	And Esau said to Jacob, “Give me some of that red stuff
GEN.25.31	Then Jacob said, “Sell me your birthright first.”
GEN.25.32	And Esau said, “Look, I am going to die; now what is this birthright to me?” 
GEN.25.33	Then Jacob said, “Swear to me first.”
GEN.25.34	Then Jacob gave Esau bread, and thick lentil stew, and he ate and drank. Then he got up and went away. So Esau despised his birthright. 
GEN.26.1	And there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine which was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, to Gerar. 
GEN.26.2	And Yahweh appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land which I will show to you. 
GEN.26.3	Dwell as an alien in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you, for I will give all these lands to you and to your descendants, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham you father. 
GEN.26.4	And I will multiply your descendants like the stars of heaven, and I will give to your descendants all these lands. And all nations of the earth will be blessed through your offspring, 
GEN.26.5	because Abraham listened to my voice and kept my charge: my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.” 
GEN.26.6	So Isaac settled in Gerar. 
GEN.26.7	When the men of the place asked concerning his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “my wife,” thinking
GEN.26.8	And it happened that, when he had been there a long time,
GEN.26.9	And Abimelech called Isaac
GEN.26.10	And Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have slept with your wife! Then you would have brought guilt upon us!” 
GEN.26.11	Then Abimelech instructed all the people, saying, “The one who touches this man or his wife shall certainly die.” 
GEN.26.12	And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in that same year a hundredfold, and Yahweh blessed him. 
GEN.26.13	And the man became wealthier and wealthier
GEN.26.14	And he possessed sheep and cattle and many servants, so that the Philistines envied him. 
GEN.26.15	And the Philistines stopped up all the wells that the servants of his father had dug in the days of Abraham his father. They filled them with earth. 
GEN.26.16	And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you have become much too powerful for us.” 
GEN.26.17	So Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there. 
GEN.26.18	And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after the death of Abraham. And he gave
GEN.26.19	And when the servants of Isaac dug in the valley, they found a well of fresh water there. 
GEN.26.20	Then the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac, saying, “The water is ours.” And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him. 
GEN.26.21	And they dug another well, and they quarreled over it also. And he called its name Sitnah. 
GEN.26.22	Then he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. And he called its name Rehoboth, and said, “Now Yahweh has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.” 
GEN.26.23	And from there he went up to Beersheba. 
GEN.26.24	And Yahweh appeared to him that night and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you, and I will bless you and make your descendants numerous for the sake of my servant Abraham.” 
GEN.26.25	And he built an altar there and called on the name of Yahweh. And he pitched his tent there, and the servants of Isaac dug a well there. 
GEN.26.26	Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend and Phicol his army commander. 
GEN.26.27	And Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me? You hate me and sent me away from you.” 
GEN.26.28	And they said, “We see clearly that Yahweh has been with you, so we thought
GEN.26.29	that you may not do us harm just as we have not touched you, but have only done good to you and sent you away in peace. You are now blessed by Yahweh.” 
GEN.26.30	So he made a meal for them, and they ate and drank. 
GEN.26.31	And they arose early in the morning and each one swore to the other,
GEN.26.32	And it happened that on that same day the servants of Isaac came and told him about the well that they had dug. And they said, “We have found water!” 
GEN.26.33	And he called it Sheba. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day. 
GEN.26.34	And when Esau was forty years old he took as wife Judith, daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, daughter of Elon the Hittite. 
GEN.26.35	And they made life bitter
GEN.27.1	And it happened that when Isaac was old and his eyesight was weak,
GEN.27.2	And he said, “Look, I am old; I do not know the day of my death. 
GEN.27.3	So now, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt food for me. 
GEN.27.4	Then make for me tasty food like I love, and bring it to me. And I will eat it so that I
GEN.27.5	Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to Esau his son, and when Esau went to the field to hunt wild game to bring back, 
GEN.27.6	Rebekah said to Jacob her son, “Look, I heard your father speaking to Esau your brother saying, 
GEN.27.7	‘Bring wild game to me and prepare tasty food so I can eat it and bless you before Yahweh before my death.’ 
GEN.27.8	So now, my son, listen to my voice, to what I command you. 
GEN.27.9	Go to the flock and take two good young goats from it for me, and I will prepare them as tasty food for your father, just as he likes. 
GEN.27.10	Then you must take it to your father and he will eat it so that he may bless you before his death.” 
GEN.27.11	Then Jacob said to his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, but I am a smooth man. 
GEN.27.12	Perhaps my father will feel me and I will be in his eyes as a mocker, and he will bring upon me a curse and not a blessing.” 
GEN.27.13	Then his mother said to him, “Your curse be upon me, my son, only listen to my voice—go and get them for me.” 
GEN.27.14	So he went and took them, and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared tasty food as his father liked. 
GEN.27.15	Then Rebekah took some of her older son Esau’s best garments that were with her in the house, and she put them on Jacob her younger son. 
GEN.27.16	And she put the skins of the young goats over his hands and over the smooth part of his neck.
GEN.27.17	And she put the tasty food and the bread that she had made into the hand of Jacob, her son. 
GEN.27.18	And he went to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?” 
GEN.27.19	And Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please get up, sit up and eat from my wild game so that you
GEN.27.20	Then Isaac said to his son, “How
GEN.27.21	Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please, come near and let me feel you, my son. Are you really
GEN.27.22	And Jacob drew near to Isaac his father. And he felt him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” 
GEN.27.23	And he did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like the hands of Esau his brother. And he blessed him. 
GEN.27.24	And he said, “Are you really
GEN.27.25	Then he said, “Bring it near to me that I may eat from the game of my son, so that I
GEN.27.26	Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near and kiss me, my son.” 
GEN.27.27	And he drew near and kissed him. And he
GEN.27.27	“Look, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that Yahweh has blessed! 
GEN.27.28	May God give you of the dew of heaven 
GEN.27.28	and of the fatness of the earth, 
GEN.27.28	and abundance of grain and new wine. 
GEN.27.29	Let peoples serve you, 
GEN.27.29	and nations bow down to you; 
GEN.27.29	Be lord of your brothers, 
GEN.27.29	and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. 
GEN.27.29	Cursed be those cursing you, 
GEN.27.29	and blessed be those blessing you.” 
GEN.27.30	And as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, immediately after
GEN.27.31	He too prepared tasty food and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, “Let my father arise and eat from the wild game of his son, that you
GEN.27.32	And Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?” And he said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.” 
GEN.27.33	Then Isaac trembled violently.
GEN.27.34	When Esau heard the words of his father he cried out with a great and exceedingly bitter cry of distress. And he said to his father, “Bless me as well, my father!” 
GEN.27.35	And he said, “Your brother came in deceit and took your blessing.” 
GEN.27.36	Then he said, “Isn’t that why he is named Jacob?
GEN.27.37	Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, “Behold, I have made him lord over you and I have given him all his brothers as servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. Now what can I do for you, my son?” 
GEN.27.38	And Esau said to his father, “Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me also, my father!” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept. 
GEN.27.39	Then Isaac his father answered and said to him, 
GEN.27.39	“Your home shall be from
GEN.27.39	and from the dew of heaven above. 
GEN.27.40	But by your sword you shall live, 
GEN.27.40	and you shall serve your brother. 
GEN.27.40	But it shall be that when free yourself 
GEN.27.40	you shall tear off his yoke from your neck. 
GEN.27.41	Then Esau held a grudge against Jacob on account of the blessing with which his father had blessed him. And Esau said in his heart,
GEN.27.42	But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called for her younger son Jacob. And she said to him, “Look, Esau your brother is consoling himself concerning you, intending to kill you. 
GEN.27.43	Now then, my son, listen to my voice; arise and flee to Haran to Laban my brother. 
GEN.27.44	Stay with him a few days until the wrath of your brother has turned—
GEN.27.45	until the anger of your brother turns from you and he has forgotten what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I lose the two of you in one day?” 
GEN.27.46	Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I loathe my life because of the Hittite women.
GEN.28.1	Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him. And he instructed him and said to him, “You must not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. 
GEN.28.2	Arise, go to Paddan-Aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother’s father, and take for yourself a wife from there, from the daughters of Laban your mother’s brother. 
GEN.28.3	Now, may El-Shaddai
GEN.28.4	And may he give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your descendants with you, that you may take possession of the land of your sojourning, which God gave to Abraham.” 
GEN.28.5	Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-Aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau. 
GEN.28.6	Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-Aram, to take for himself a wife from there, and
GEN.28.7	and that Jacob listened to his father and to his mother and went to Paddan-Aram. 
GEN.28.8	Then Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father, 
GEN.28.9	then Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, son of Abraham, sister of Nebaioth, as a wife, in addition to the wives he had. 
GEN.28.10	Then Jacob went out from Beersheba and went to Haran. 
GEN.28.11	And he arrived at a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set. And he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head and slept at that place. 
GEN.28.12	And he dreamed, and behold, a stairway was set on the earth, and its top touched the heavens. And behold, angels of God were going up and going down on it. 
GEN.28.13	And behold, Yahweh was standing beside him,
GEN.28.14	Your descendants shall be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west, and to the east, and to the north and to the south. And all the families of the earth will be blessed through you and through your descendants. 
GEN.28.15	Now behold, I am with you, and I will keep you wherever you go. And I will bring you to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised to you.” 
GEN.28.16	Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely Yahweh is indeed
GEN.28.17	Then he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is nothing else than the house of God,
GEN.28.18	And Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a stone pillar, and poured oil on top of it. 
GEN.28.19	And he called the name of that place Bethel; however, the name of the city was formerly Luz. 
GEN.28.20	And Jacob made a vow
GEN.28.21	and if I return in peace to the house of my father, then Yahweh will become my God. 
GEN.28.22	And this stone that I have set up as a pillar shall be the house of God, and of all that you give to me I will certainly give a tenth to you.” 
GEN.29.1	And Jacob continued his journey
GEN.29.2	And he looked, and behold, there was a well in the field, and behold, there were three flocks of sheep lying beside it, for out of that well the flocks were watered. And the stone on the mouth of the well was large. 
GEN.29.3	And when all the flocks were gathered there, they rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well. And they watered the sheep and returned the stone upon the mouth of the well to its place. 
GEN.29.4	And Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where are you from?” And they said, “We are from Haran.” 
GEN.29.5	And he said to them, “Do you know Laban, son of Nahor?” And they said, “We know him.” 
GEN.29.6	And he said to them, “Is he well?”
GEN.29.7	And he said, “Look, it is still broad daylight;
GEN.29.8	And they said, “We are not able, until all the flocks are gathered. Then the stone is rolled away from the mouth of the well, and we water the sheep.” 
GEN.29.9	While he was speaking with them, Rachel came with the sheep which belonged to her father, for she was pasturing them. 
GEN.29.10	And it happened that, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, Jacob drew near and rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well and watered the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother. 
GEN.29.11	And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept. 
GEN.29.12	And Jacob told Rachel that he was the relative of her father, and that he was the son of Rebekah. And she ran and told her father.
GEN.29.13	And it happened that when Laban heard the message about Jacob, the son of his sister, he ran to meet him. And he embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. 
GEN.29.14	And Laban said to him, “Surely you are my flesh and my bone!” And he stayed with him a month. 
GEN.29.15	Then Laban said to Jacob, “Just because you are my brother should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wage should be.” 
GEN.29.16	Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
GEN.29.17	Now the eyes of Leah were dull, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. 
GEN.29.18	And Jacob loved Rachel and said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.” 
GEN.29.19	Then Laban said, “Better that I give her to you than I give her to another man. Stay with me.” 
GEN.29.20	And Jacob worked for Rachel seven years, but they were as a few days in his eyes because he loved her. 
GEN.29.21	And Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, that I may go in to her, for my time
GEN.29.22	So Laban gathered all the men of the place and prepared a feast. 
GEN.29.23	And it happened that in the evening he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him, and he went in to her. 
GEN.29.24	And Laban gave Zilpah his female servant to her, to Leah his daughter as a female servant. 
GEN.29.25	And it happened that in the morning, behold, it was Leah! And he said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Now why did you deceive me?” 
GEN.29.26	Then Laban said, “It is not the custom
GEN.29.27	Complete the week of this one,
GEN.29.28	And Jacob did so. So he completed the week of this one,
GEN.29.29	And Laban gave Bilhah his female servant to Rachel his daughter as a female servant. 
GEN.29.30	Then he also went in to Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served with him yet another seven years. 
GEN.29.31	When Yahweh saw that Leah was unloved he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. 
GEN.29.32	Then Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, “Because Yahweh has noticed my misery, that I am unloved. Now my husband will love me.” 
GEN.29.33	And she conceived again and gave birth to a son. And she said, “It is because Yahweh has heard that I am unloved that he gave me this son also.” And she called his name Simeon. 
GEN.29.34	And she conceived again and gave birth to a son. Then she said, “Now this time my husband will be joined to me, for I have borne him three sons.” Therefore, she called his name Levi. 
GEN.29.35	And she conceived again and gave birth to a son. And she said, “This time I will praise Yahweh.” Therefore she called his name Judah. And she ceased bearing children. 
GEN.30.1	When Rachel saw that she could not bear children to Jacob, Rachel envied her sister. And she said to Jacob, “Give me children—if not, I will die!” 
GEN.30.2	And Jacob became angry
GEN.30.3	Then she said, “Here is my servant girl Bilhah; go in to her that she may bear children as my surrogate.
GEN.30.4	Then she gave him Bilhah, her female servant, as a wife, and Jacob went in to her 
GEN.30.5	And Bilhah conceived and gave birth to a son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.6	Then Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son.” Therefore she called his name Dan. 
GEN.30.7	And Bilhah, Rachel’s servant, conceived again and bore a second son to Jacob. 
GEN.30.8	And Rachel said, “I have struggled a mighty struggle with my sister and have prevailed.” And she called his name Naphtali. 
GEN.30.9	When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took Zilpah her female servant and gave her to Jacob as a wife. 
GEN.30.10	And Zilpah, the female slave of Leah, bore a son to Jacob. 
GEN.30.11	Then Leah said, “Good fortune!” And she called his name Gad. 
GEN.30.12	And Zilpah, Leah’s female servant, bore a second son to Jacob. 
GEN.30.13	Then Leah said, “How happy am I! For women have called me happy.” So she called his name Asher. 
GEN.30.14	And in the days of the wheat harvest, Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and he brought them to Leah his mother. And Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.” 
GEN.30.15	And she said to her, “Is your taking my husband such a small thing that you will also take the mandrakes of my son?” Then Rachel said, “Then he may sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.” 
GEN.30.16	When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him. And she said, “Come in to me, for I have hired
GEN.30.17	And God listened to Leah and she conceived and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.18	Then Leah said, “God has given me my wage since I gave my servant girl to my husband.” And she called his name Issachar. 
GEN.30.19	And Leah conceived again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.20	And Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good gift. This time my husband will acknowledge me, because I bore him six sons.” And she called his name Zebulun. 
GEN.30.21	And afterward she gave birth to a daughter. And she called her name Dinah. 
GEN.30.22	Then God remembered Rachel and listened to her, and God opened her womb. 
GEN.30.23	And she conceived and gave birth to a son. And she said, “God has taken away my disgrace.” 
GEN.30.24	And she called his name Joseph, saying, “Yahweh has added to me another son.” 
GEN.30.25	And it happened that as soon as Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away that I may go to my place and my land. 
GEN.30.26	Give me my wives and my children for which I have served you, and let me go. For you yourself know my service that I have rendered to you.” 
GEN.30.27	But Laban said to him, “Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, I have learned by divination that Yahweh has blessed me because of you.” 
GEN.30.28	And he said, “Name your wage to me and I will give it.” 
GEN.30.29	Then he said to him, “You yourself know how I have served you and how your livestock have been with me.
GEN.30.30	For you had little before me, and it has increased abundantly. And Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned.
GEN.30.31	And he said, “What shall I give you?” And Jacob said, “Do not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flocks and keep them. 
GEN.30.32	Let me pass through all your flocks today, removing all the speckled and spotted sheep from them, along with
GEN.30.33	And my righteousness will answer for me later
GEN.30.34	Then Laban said, “Look! Very well. It shall be according to your word.” 
GEN.30.35	But that day he
GEN.30.36	And he put a journey of three days between him and Jacob, and Jacob pastured the remainder of Laban’s flock. 
GEN.30.37	Then Jacob took fresh branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees and peeled white strips on them, exposing the white which was on the branches. 
GEN.30.38	And he set the branches that he had peeled in front of the flocks, in the troughs and in the water containers. And they were in heat when they came to drink. 
GEN.30.39	And the flocks mated by the branches, so the flocks bore streaked, speckled, and spotted. 
GEN.30.40	And Jacob separated the lambs and turned the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the dark-colored in Laban’s flocks. And he put his own herds apart, and did not put them with the flocks of Laban. 
GEN.30.41	And whenever any of the stronger of the flocks were in heat, Jacob put the branches in full view
GEN.30.42	But with the more feeble of the flock he would not put them there. So the feebler were Laban’s and the stronger were Jacob’s. 
GEN.30.43	And the man became exceedingly
GEN.31.1	Now he
GEN.31.2	Then Jacob saw the face of Laban and, behold, it was not like it had been in the past.
GEN.31.3	And Yahweh said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your ancestors
GEN.31.4	So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flocks, 
GEN.31.5	and he said to them, “Look, I see the face of your father, that it is not like it has been toward me in the past.
GEN.31.6	Now you yourselves know that I have served your father with all my strength, 
GEN.31.7	and your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God has not allowed him to harm me. 
GEN.31.8	If thus he said, ‘Speckled shall be your wage,’ then all the flock bore speckled. And if he said, ‘Streaked shall be your wage,’ then all the flock bore streaked. 
GEN.31.9	God has taken away your father’s livestock and given them to me. 
GEN.31.10	Now it happened that at the time of the mating of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams mounting the flock were streaked, speckled, and dappled. 
GEN.31.11	Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’ 
GEN.31.12	And he said, ‘Lift up your eyes and see—all the rams mounting the flock are streaked, speckled, and dappled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you. 
GEN.31.13	I am the God of Bethel where you anointed a stone pillar, where you made a vow to me. Now get up, go out from this land and return to the land of your birth.’ ” 
GEN.31.14	Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, “Is there yet a portion for us, and an inheritance in the house of our father? 
GEN.31.15	Are we not regarded as foreigners by him, because he has sold us and completely consumed our money? 
GEN.31.16	For all the wealth that God has taken away from our father, it belongs to us and to our sons. So now, all that God has said to you, do.” 
GEN.31.17	Then Jacob got up and put his children and his wives on the camels. 
GEN.31.18	And he drove all his livestock and his possessions that he had acquired, the livestock of his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-Aram, in order to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan. 
GEN.31.19	Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole the idols
GEN.31.20	And Jacob tricked
GEN.31.21	Then he fled with all that he had, and arose and crossed the Euphrates
GEN.31.22	And on the third day it was told to Laban that Jacob had fled. 
GEN.31.23	Then he took his kinsmen with him and pursued after him, a seven-day journey, and he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead. 
GEN.31.24	And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, “Take care
GEN.31.25	And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban and his kinsmen pitched their tents in the hill country of Gilead. 
GEN.31.26	Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done that you tricked me
GEN.31.27	Why did you hide your intention to flee and trick me,
GEN.31.28	And why did you not give me opportunity to kiss my grandsons
GEN.31.29	It is in my power
GEN.31.30	Now, you have surely gone because you desperately longed for the house of your father, but why did you steal my gods?” 
GEN.31.31	Then Jacob answered and said to Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I thought, ‘Lest you take your daughters from me by force.’ 
GEN.31.32	But with whomever you find your gods, he shall not live. In the presence of your kinsmen now identify what is with me that is yours and take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them. 
GEN.31.33	Then Laban went into Jacob’s tent and Leah’s tent and the tent of the two female servants and did not find his gods. And he came out of Leah’s tent and went into Rachel’s tent. 
GEN.31.34	Now Rachel had taken the idols and put them in the saddle bag of the camel and sat on them. And Jacob searched the whole tent thoroughly but did not find them. 
GEN.31.35	And she said to her father, “Let there not be anger in the eyes of my lord, for I am not able to rise before you, for the way of women is with me. And he searched carefully and did not find the idols. 
GEN.31.36	Then Jacob became angry and quarreled with Laban. Jacob answered and said to Laban, “What is my offense? What is my sin that you pursued after me? 
GEN.31.37	For you have searched all my possessions and what did you find among all the possessions of my household? Set it before my kinsmen and your kinsmen that they may decide between the two of us! 
GEN.31.38	These twenty years I was with you; your ewes and your female goats did not miscarry, and the rams of your flocks I did not eat. 
GEN.31.39	I brought no mangled carcass to you—I bore its loss. From my hand you sought it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 
GEN.31.40	There I was, during the day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes. 
GEN.31.41	These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. 
GEN.31.42	If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac had not been with me, indeed now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my misery and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night.” 
GEN.31.43	Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters and the grandsons
GEN.31.44	So now, come, let us make
GEN.31.45	And Jacob took a stone and set it up as a stone pillar. 
GEN.31.46	And Jacob said to his kinsmen, “Gather stones.” And they took stones and made a pile of stones, and they ate there by the pile of stones. 
GEN.31.47	And Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha,
GEN.31.48	Then Laban said, “This pile of stones is a witness between me and you today.” Therefore its name is called Galeed,
GEN.31.49	and Mizpah,
GEN.31.50	If you mistreat my daughters, and if you take wives besides my daughters, when there is no man with us, see—God is a witness between me and you.” 
GEN.31.51	And Laban said to Jacob, “See, this pile of stones, and see the pillar that I have set up between me and you. 
GEN.31.52	This pile of stones is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass beyond this pile of stones to you, and that you will not pass beyond this pile of stones and this pillar to me intending harm. 
GEN.31.53	May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father
GEN.31.54	And Jacob sacrificed a sacrifice on the hill, and he called his kinsmen to eat the meal.
GEN.31.55	 And Laban arose early in the morning and kissed his grandsons
GEN.32.1	And Jacob went on his way, and angels of God met him. 
GEN.32.2	And when he saw them, Jacob said, “This is the camp of God!” And he called the name of that place Mahanaim. 
GEN.32.3	Then Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the territory of Edom. 
GEN.32.4	And he instructed them, saying, “Thus you must say to my lord, to Esau, ‘Thus says your servant Jacob, I have dwelled as an alien with Laban, and I have remained there until now. 
GEN.32.5	And I have acquired cattle, male donkeys, flocks, and male and female slaves, and I have sent to tell my lord, to find favor in your eyes.’ ” 
GEN.32.6	And the messengers returned to Jacob and said, “We came to your brother, to Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.” 
GEN.32.7	Then Jacob was very frightened and distressed. So he divided the people, flocks, cattle, and camels that were with him into two companies. 
GEN.32.8	And he thought, “If Esau comes to one company and destroys it, the remaining company will be able to escape.” 
GEN.32.9	Then Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Yahweh, who said to me, ‘Return to your land and to your family, and I will deal well with you.’ 
GEN.32.10	I am not worthy
GEN.32.11	Please rescue me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and attack mother and children alike. 
GEN.32.12	Now you yourself said, ‘I will surely deal well with you and make your offspring as the sand of the sea that cannot be counted for abundance.’ ” 
GEN.32.13	And he lodged there that night. Then he took from what he had with him
GEN.32.14	two hundred female goats, twenty male goats, two hundred ewes, twenty rams, 
GEN.32.15	thirty milk camels with their young, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys, and ten male donkeys. 
GEN.32.16	And he put them under the hand of his servants, herd by herd,
GEN.32.17	And he instructed the foremost, saying, “When Esau my brother comes upon you and asks you, saying, ‘Whose are you and where are you going? To whom do these animals belong ahead of you?’ 
GEN.32.18	Then you must say, ‘To your servant, to Jacob. It is a gift sent to my lord, to Esau. Now behold, he is also coming after us.’ ” 
GEN.32.19	And he also instructed the second servant and the third, and everyone else who was behind the herds, saying, “You must speak to Esau according to this word when you find him. 
GEN.32.20	And moreover, you shall say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is behind us.’ ” For he thought, “Let me appease him
GEN.32.21	So the gift passed on before him, but he himself spent that night in the camp. 
GEN.32.22	That night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. 
GEN.32.23	And he took them and sent them across the stream. Then he sent across all his possessions. 
GEN.32.24	And Jacob remained alone, and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the dawn. 
GEN.32.25	And when he
GEN.32.26	Then he
GEN.32.27	Then he said to him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.” 
GEN.32.28	And he said, “Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel,
GEN.32.29	Then Jacob asked and said, “Please tell me your name.” And he said, “Why do you ask this—for my name?” And he blessed him there. 
GEN.32.30	Then Jacob called the name of the place Peniel which means “I have seen God face to face and my life was spared.” 
GEN.32.31	Then the sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip. 
GEN.32.32	Therefore the Israelites
GEN.33.1	And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked. And behold, Esau was coming and four hundred men were with him. And he
GEN.33.2	And he put the female slaves and their children first, then Leah and her children next, then Rachel with Joseph last. 
GEN.33.3	And he himself passed on before them and bowed down to the ground seven times until he came to his brother. 
GEN.33.4	But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell upon his neck and kissed him, and they wept. 
GEN.33.5	Then Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said, “Who are these with you?” And he said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.” 
GEN.33.6	Then the female servants drew near, they and their children, and they bowed down. 
GEN.33.7	Then Leah and her children drew near and bowed down, and afterward Joseph and Rachel drew near and they bowed down. 
GEN.33.8	And he
GEN.33.9	Then Esau said, “I have enough
GEN.33.10	And Jacob said, “No, please, if I have found favor in your eyes, you must take my gift from my hand, for then I have seen your face which is like seeing the face of God, and you have received me. 
GEN.33.11	Please take my gift which has been brought to you, for God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.”
GEN.33.12	Then he
GEN.33.13	But he said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and the flocks and the cattle which are nursing are a concern to me. Now if they drove them hard for a day all the flocks would die. 
GEN.33.14	Let my lord pass on before his servant and I will move along slowly at the pace
GEN.33.15	And Esau said, “Let me leave some of my people with you.” But he said, “What need is there?
GEN.33.16	So Esau turned that day on his way to Seir. 
GEN.33.17	But Jacob traveled on to Succoth, and he built for himself a house, and he made shelters for his livestock. Therefore he called the name of the place Succoth. 
GEN.33.18	And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem which is in the land of Canaan, on his way
GEN.33.19	And he bought a piece of land where he pitched his tent for one hundred pieces of money
GEN.33.20	And there he erected an altar and called it “El Elohe Israel.”
GEN.34.1	Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 
GEN.34.2	And Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. And he took her and lay with her and raped her. 
GEN.34.3	And his soul clung to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly
GEN.34.4	So Shechem said to Hamor his father, saying, “Get this girl for me as a wife.” 
GEN.34.5	And Jacob heard that Dinah his daughter had been defiled, but his sons were with his flocks in the field. And Jacob kept silent until they came. 
GEN.34.6	And Hamor, father of Shechem, went out to Jacob to speak with him. 
GEN.34.7	And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. And the men were distressed and very angry because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by having sexual relations with the daughter of Jacob—something that
GEN.34.8	And Hamor spoke with them saying, “Shechem my son is in love with
GEN.34.9	Make marriages with us. Give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves. 
GEN.34.10	You shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you; settle and trade in it, and acquire property in it.” 
GEN.34.11	Then Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will do. 
GEN.34.12	Make the bride price and gift as high as you like;
GEN.34.13	Then the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor speaking deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister. 
GEN.34.14	And they said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for that is a disgrace for us. 
GEN.34.15	Only on this condition will we give consent to you; if you will become like us—every male among you to be circumcised. 
GEN.34.16	Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take for ourselves your daughters, and we will live with you and become one family. 
GEN.34.17	But if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised, then we will take our daughters and we will go.” 
GEN.34.18	And their words were good in the eyes of Hamor and in the eyes of Shechem, the son of Hamor. 
GEN.34.19	And the young man did not delay to do the thing, for he wanted the daughter of Jacob. Now he was the most honored of his father’s house. 
GEN.34.20	Then Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city, and they spoke to the men of their city, saying, 
GEN.34.21	“These men are at peace with us. Let them dwell in the land and let them trade in it. Now, behold, the land is broad enough for them.
GEN.34.22	Only on this condition will they give consent to us, to live with us and to become one family—when every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised. 
GEN.34.23	Will not their livestock and their property and all their animals be ours? Only let us give consent to them so they will live among us.” 
GEN.34.24	And all those who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and Shechem. Every male was circumcised, all those who went out of the gate of his city. 
GEN.34.25	And it happened that on the third day, while they were in pain, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dinah, each took his sword and came against the unsuspecting city and killed all the males. 
GEN.34.26	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the edge of the sword, and they took Dinah from the house of Shechem and went out. 
GEN.34.27	The other sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister. 
GEN.34.28	They took their flocks and their cattle and their donkeys, and whatever was in the field. 
GEN.34.29	They captured and plundered all that was in the houses—all their wealth, their little ones, and their women. 
GEN.34.30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me, making me stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites! I am few in number! If they gather against me and attack me, I will be destroyed—I and my household!” 
GEN.34.31	But they said, “Shall he treat our sister like a prostitute?” 
GEN.35.1	And God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there, and make an altar to the God who appeared to you when you fled from before Esau your brother.” 
GEN.35.2	Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods that are in your midst and purify yourselves and change your garments. 
GEN.35.3	Then let us make ready and let us go up to Bethel, so that I can make an altar there to the God who answered me in the day of my trouble, and who has been with me on the way that I have gone.” 
GEN.35.4	So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that were in their hands, and the ornamental rings that were in their ears. And Jacob buried them under the oak which was near Shechem. 
GEN.35.5	Then they set out on their journey, and the terror of God was upon the cities that were all around them, so that they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 
GEN.35.6	And Jacob came to Luz which was in the land of Canaan (that is Bethel), he and all the people that were with him. 
GEN.35.7	And he built an altar there and called the place El-Bethel, for there God had appeared to him when he fled before his brother. 
GEN.35.8	And Deborah, the nurse of Rebekah, died. And she was buried below Bethel, under the oak. And its name was called Allon-Bacuth.
GEN.35.9	And God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-Aram, and he blessed him. 
GEN.35.10	And God said to him, “Your name is Jacob. Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name.” Then his name was called Israel. 
GEN.35.11	And God said to him, “I am El-Shaddai.
GEN.35.12	And as for the land that I gave to Abraham and to Isaac, I will give it to you. And to your descendants after you I will give the land. 
GEN.35.13	And God went up from him at the place where he spoke with him. 
GEN.35.14	And Jacob set up a pillar at the place where God had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. And he poured out a drink offering upon it, and poured oil on it. 
GEN.35.15	And Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him Bethel. 
GEN.35.16	Then they journeyed from Bethel. And when they were still some distance
GEN.35.17	And when her labor was the most difficult
GEN.35.18	And it happened that when her life was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-Oni.
GEN.35.19	And Rachel died and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 
GEN.35.20	And Jacob erected a pillar at her burial site. That is the pillar of the burial site of Rachel unto this day. 
GEN.35.21	And Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
GEN.35.22	And while Israel was living in that land Reuben went and had sexual relations with Bilhah, his father’s concubine. And Israel heard about it. 
GEN.35.22	Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. 
GEN.35.23	The sons of Leah: The firstborn of Jacob was Reuben. Then Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. 
GEN.35.24	The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.35.25	The sons of Bilhah, the female servant of Rachel: Dan and Naphtali. 
GEN.35.26	The sons of Zilpah, the female servant of Leah: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-Aram. 
GEN.35.27	And Jacob came to Isaac his father at Mamre, or Kiriath-Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac dwelled as aliens. 
GEN.35.28	Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years. 
GEN.35.29	And Isaac passed away and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. 
GEN.36.1	Now these are the descendants of Esau (that is, Edom). 
GEN.36.2	Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah, daughter of Elon, the Hittite, and Oholibamah, daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, the Hivite, 
GEN.36.3	and Basemath, the daughter of Ishmael, the sister of Nebaioth. 
GEN.36.4	And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bore Reuel; 
GEN.36.5	and Oholibamah bore Jeush and Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.36.6	And Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters, and all the persons of his household, and his sheep and goats, and all his cattle, and all the goods that he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to a land away from his brother Jacob. 
GEN.36.7	For their possessions were too many to live together,
GEN.36.8	So Esau dwelled in the hill country of Seir (Esau, that is Edom). 
GEN.36.9	Now these are the descendants of Esau, the father of Edom, in the hill country of Seir. 
GEN.36.10	These are the names of the sons of Esau: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, the wife of Esau; Reuel, the son of Basemath, the wife of Esau. 
GEN.36.11	The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 
GEN.36.12	(Now Timnah was the concubine of Eliphaz, the son of Esau. And she bore Amalek to Eliphaz.) These are the sons of Adah, the wife of Esau. 
GEN.36.13	Now these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the sons of Basemath, the wife of Esau. 
GEN.36.14	Now these are the sons of Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, daughter of Zibeon, the wife of Esau: She bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. 
GEN.36.15	These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau: the chiefs of Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 
GEN.36.16	Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These are the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah. 
GEN.36.17	Now these are the sons Reuel, the son of Esau: the chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Basemath, the wife of Esau. 
GEN.36.18	Now these are the sons of Oholibamah, the wife of Esau: the chiefs Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the chiefs born of Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the wife of Esau. 
GEN.36.19	These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs (that is, Edom). 
GEN.36.20	These are the sons of Seir, the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.21	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom. 
GEN.36.22	And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. And Lotan’s sister was Timna. 
GEN.36.23	Now these are the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 
GEN.36.24	Now these are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah—he is Anah who found the hot springs in the desert while he pastured the donkeys of Zibeon his father. 
GEN.36.25	Now these are the sons of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah. 
GEN.36.26	Now these are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Keran. 
GEN.36.27	These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. 
GEN.36.28	These are the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran. 
GEN.36.29	These are the chiefs of the Horites: the chiefs Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.30	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir. 
GEN.36.31	Now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king ruled over the Israelites.
GEN.36.32	Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom. And the name of his city was Dinhabah. 
GEN.36.33	And Bela died, and Jobab, the son of Zerah from Bozrah, reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.34	And Jobab died, and Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.35	And Husham died, and Hadad, son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the field
GEN.36.36	And Hadad died, and Samlah from Masrekah reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.37	And Samlah died, and Shaul from Rehoboth on the Euphrates
GEN.36.38	And Shaul died, and Baal-Hanan, the son of Acbor, reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.39	And Baal-Hanan the son of Acbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Pau, and the name of his wife was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezahab. 
GEN.36.40	Now these are the names of the chiefs of Esau according to their families, according to their dwelling places, by their names: the chiefs Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, 
GEN.36.41	Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 
GEN.36.42	Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 
GEN.36.43	Magdiel, and Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom (that is, Esau, the father of Edom) according to their settlements in the land of their possession. 
GEN.37.1	And Jacob settled in the land of the sojourning of his father, in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.37.2	These are the generations
GEN.37.3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, for he was a son of his old age. And he made a robe with long sleeves
GEN.37.4	When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and were not able to speak peaceably to him. 
GEN.37.5	And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers. And they hated him even more.
GEN.37.6	And he said to them, “Listen now to this dream that I dreamed. 
GEN.37.7	Now behold, we were binding sheaves in the midst of the field and, behold, my sheaf stood up and it remained standing. Then behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf.” 
GEN.37.8	Then his brothers said to him, “Will you really rule over us?” And they hated him even more
GEN.37.9	Then he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brothers. And he said, “Behold, I dreamed a dream again, and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” 
GEN.37.10	And he told it to his father and to his brothers. And his father rebuked him and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down to the ground to you?” 
GEN.37.11	And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind. 
GEN.37.12	Now his brothers went to pasture the flock of their father in Shechem. 
GEN.37.13	And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing in Shechem? Come, let me send you to them.” And he said, “Here I am.” 
GEN.37.14	Then he said to him, “Go now, see if it goes well for your brothers and for the flock,
GEN.37.15	And a man found him, and behold, he
GEN.37.16	And he said, “I am seeking my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are pasturing.” 
GEN.37.17	And the man said, “They have moved on from here, for I heard them saying, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’ ” Then Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan. 
GEN.37.18	And they saw him from a distance. And before he drew near to them, they conspired against him to kill him. 
GEN.37.19	And each said to his brothers, “Look, this master of dreams is coming. 
GEN.37.20	Now then, come, let us kill him and throw him in one of the pits. Then we will say a wild animal devoured him. Then we will see what his dreams become.” 
GEN.37.21	And Reuben heard it and delivered him from their hand and said, “We must not take his life.” 
GEN.37.22	And Reuben said to them, “You must not shed blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the desert, but do not lay a hand on him”—so that he might rescue him from their hand to return him to his father. 
GEN.37.23	And it happened that as Joseph came to his brothers they stripped Joseph of his robe, the robe with long sleeves,
GEN.37.24	And they took him and threw him into the pit (the pit was empty; there was no water in it). 
GEN.37.25	Then they sat down to eat some food. And they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead. And their camels were carrying aromatic gum and balm and spices on the way
GEN.37.26	Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is there if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? 
GEN.37.27	Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, but our hand shall not be against him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And his brothers agreed. 
GEN.37.28	Then Midianite traders passed by. And they
GEN.37.29	Then Reuben returned to the pit and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit. And he tore his clothes. 
GEN.37.30	And he returned to his brothers and said, “The boy is gone!
GEN.37.31	Then they took the robe of Joseph and slaughtered a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood. 
GEN.37.32	Then they sent the robe with long sleeves
GEN.37.33	And he recognized it and said, “The robe of my son! A wild animal has devoured him! Joseph is surely torn to pieces!” 
GEN.37.34	And Jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days. 
GEN.37.35	And all his sons and daughters tried to console him, but he refused to be consoled. And he said, “No, I shall go down to my son, to Sheol, mourning.” And his father wept for him. 
GEN.37.36	And the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, a court official of Pharaoh, a commander of the imperial guard. 
GEN.38.1	And it happened that at that time Judah went down from his brothers and pitched his tent near a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 
GEN.38.2	And Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite there whose name was Shua. And he took her and went in to her. 
GEN.38.3	And she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er. 
GEN.38.4	And she conceived again and bore a son, and he called his name Onan. 
GEN.38.5	And once again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. And he
GEN.38.6	And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 
GEN.38.7	And Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and Yahweh killed him. 
GEN.38.8	Then Judah said to Onan, “Go in to the wife of your brother and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.” 
GEN.38.9	But Onan knew that the offspring would not be for him, so whenever he went in to the wife of his brother he would waste it on the ground
GEN.38.10	And what he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh, so he killed him also. 
GEN.38.11	Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, “Stay a widow in your father’s house until Shelah my son grows up,” for he feared he would also die
GEN.38.12	And in the course of time
GEN.38.13	And it was told to Tamar, saying, “Look, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.” 
GEN.38.14	So she removed the clothes of her widowhood and covered herself with the veil and disguised herself. And she sat at the entrance to Eynayim, which is on the way to Timnah, for she saw that Shelah was grown but she had not been given to him as a wife. 
GEN.38.15	And Judah saw her and reckoned her to be a prostitute, for she had covered her face. 
GEN.38.16	And he turned aside to her at the roadside and said, “Please come, let me come in to you,” for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, “What will you give to me that you may come in to me?” 
GEN.38.17	And he said, “I will send a kid from the goats of the flock.” And she said, “Only if you give a pledge until you send it.” 
GEN.38.18	And he said, “What is the pledge that I must give to you?” And she said, “your seal, your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.” And he gave them to her and went in to her. And she conceived by him. 
GEN.38.19	And she arose and left, and she removed her veil from herself and put on the garments of her widowhood. 
GEN.38.20	And Judah sent the kid from the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite to take back the pledge from the hand of the woman, but he could not find her. 
GEN.38.21	So he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is that cult prostitute that was at Eynayim by the roadside?” And they said, “There is no cult prostitute here.” 
GEN.38.22	Then he returned to Judah and said, “I could not find her. Morever, the men of the place said, ‘There is no cult prostitute here.’ ” 
GEN.38.23	And Judah said, “Let her take them for herself, lest we be laughed at.
GEN.38.24	And about three months later
GEN.38.25	She was brought out, but she sent to her father-in-law saying, “By the man to whom these belong I have conceived.” And she said, “Now discern
GEN.38.26	Then Judah recognized them and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not know
GEN.38.27	And it happened that at the time she gave birth that, behold, twins were in her womb. 
GEN.38.28	And it happened that at her labor one child put out a hand. And the midwife took it and tied a crimson thread on his hand saying, “This one came out first.” 
GEN.38.29	Then his hand drew back and, behold, his brother came out, and she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” And she called his name Perez. 
GEN.38.30	And afterward his brother who had the crimson thread on his hand came out. And his name was called Zerah. 
GEN.39.1	Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, a court official of Pharaoh, commander of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there. 
GEN.39.2	And Yahweh was with Joseph, and he became a successful man. And he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian. 
GEN.39.3	And his master observed that Yahweh was with him, and everything that was in his hand to do Yahweh made successful. 
GEN.39.4	And Joseph found favor in his eyes and he served him. Then he appointed him
GEN.39.5	And it happened that from the time he appointed him over his house and over all that he had, Yahweh blessed the house of the Egyptian on account of Joseph. And the blessing of Yahweh was upon all that he had in the house and in the field. 
GEN.39.6	And he left all that he had in the hand of Joseph, and he did not worry about anything
GEN.39.7	And it happened that after these things his master’s wife cast her eyes on Joseph, and she said, “Lie with me.” 
GEN.39.8	But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Look, my master does not worry about
GEN.39.9	He has no greater authority in this house than me, and he has not withheld anything from me except you, since you are his wife. Now how could I do this great wickedness and sin against God?” 
GEN.39.10	And it happened that as she spoke to Joseph day after day,
GEN.39.11	But one particular day
GEN.39.12	she seized him by his garment and said, “Lie with me!” And he left his garment in her hand and fled, and he went outside. 
GEN.39.13	And it happened that when she saw that he left his garment in her hand and fled outside, 
GEN.39.14	she called to the men of her house and said to them, “Look! He
GEN.39.15	And when he heard me, that I raised my voice and called out, he left his garment beside me and fled, and he went outside.” 
GEN.39.16	Then she put his garment beside her until his master came to his house. 
GEN.39.17	Then she spoke to him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew slave that you brought to us came to me to make fun of me. 
GEN.39.18	And it happened that as I raised my voice and called out, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.” 
GEN.39.19	And when his master heard the words of his wife that she spoke to him, “This is what your servant did to me,”
GEN.39.20	And Joseph’s master took him and put him into prison, the place that the king’s prisoners were confined. And he was there in prison. 
GEN.39.21	And Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed loyal love to him, and gave him favor in the eyes of the chief of the prison. 
GEN.39.22	And the chief of the prison put all the prisoners that were in the prison into the hand of Joseph. And everything that was done there, he was the one who did it. 
GEN.39.23	The chief of the prison did not worry about
GEN.40.1	And it happened that after these things the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker did wrong against their lord, against the king of Egypt. 
GEN.40.2	And Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, with the chief cupbearer and chief baker. 
GEN.40.3	And he put them in custody in the house of the chief of the guard, into the prison where Joseph was confined. 
GEN.40.4	And the chief of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them, and he attended them. And they were in custody many days.
GEN.40.5	And the two of them, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, dreamed a dream, each his own dream, with its own interpretation. 
GEN.40.6	When Joseph came to them in the morning he looked at them, and behold, they were troubled. 
GEN.40.7	And he asked the court officials of Pharaoh that were with him in the custody of his master’s house, “Why are your faces sad today?” 
GEN.40.8	And they said to him, “We each dreamed a dream, but there is no one to interpret it.” And Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me.” 
GEN.40.9	Then the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and he said to him, “In my dream, now behold, there was a vine before me, 
GEN.40.10	and on the vine were three branches. And as it budded, its blossoms came up, and its clusters of grapes grew ripe. 
GEN.40.11	And the cup of Pharaoh was in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed them into the cup of Pharaoh. Then I placed the cup into the hand of Pharaoh.” 
GEN.40.12	Then Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: The three branches, they are three days. 
GEN.40.13	In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and will restore you to your office. And you shall put the cup of Pharaoh into his hand as was formerly the custom, when you were his cupbearer. 
GEN.40.14	But remember me when it goes well with you, and please may you show kindness with respect to me, and mention me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house. 
GEN.40.15	For I was surely kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me in this pit.” 
GEN.40.16	And when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said to Joseph, “I also dreamed. In my dream, now behold, there were three baskets of bread upon my head. 
GEN.40.17	And in the upper basket were all sorts of baked foods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket upon my head.” 
GEN.40.18	Then Joseph answered and said, “This is its interpretation: The three baskets, they are three days. 
GEN.40.19	In three days Pharaoh will lift your head from you and hang you on a pole,
GEN.40.20	And it happened that on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants. And he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker in the midst of his servants. 
GEN.40.21	And he restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearing position. And he placed the cup in the hand of Pharaoh. 
GEN.40.22	But the chief baker he hanged as Joseph had interpreted to them. 
GEN.40.23	But the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him. 
GEN.41.1	And it happened that after two full years
GEN.41.2	And behold, seven cows, well built and fat,
GEN.41.3	And behold, seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, ugly and gaunt,
GEN.41.4	And the ugly and gaunt
GEN.41.5	And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time, and behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were coming out of one stalk. 
GEN.41.6	And behold, seven thin ears of grain, scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them. 
GEN.41.7	And the thin ears of grain swallowed up the seven plump and full ears of grain. Then Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. 
GEN.41.8	And it happened that in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called all of the magicians
GEN.41.9	Then the chief of the cupbearers spoke with Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my sins today. 
GEN.41.10	Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the house of the chief of the guard. 
GEN.41.11	And we dreamed a dream one night, I and he, each with a dream that had a meaning.
GEN.41.12	And there with us was a young man, a Hebrew servant of the chief of the guard, and we told him the dream, and he interpreted our dreams for us, each according to his dream he interpreted. 
GEN.41.13	And it happened just as he interpreted to us, so it was. He
GEN.41.14	Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph, and they brought him quickly from the prison. And he shaved and changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.15	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I dreamed a dream, but there is none to interpret it. Now, I have heard concerning you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” 
GEN.41.16	Then Joseph answered Pharaoh saying, “It is not in my power;
GEN.41.17	And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Now in my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the Nile, 
GEN.41.18	and behold, seven cows, well built and fat,
GEN.41.19	And behold, seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, very ugly and gaunt
GEN.41.20	And the thin and ugly cows ate the former seven healthy cows. 
GEN.41.21	But when they went into their bellies
GEN.41.22	Then I saw in my dream and behold, seven ears of grain were coming out of one stalk, full and good. 
GEN.41.23	And behold, seven withered ears of grain, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them. 
GEN.41.24	And the thin ears of grain swallowed up the seven good ears of grain. And I told the magicians,
GEN.41.25	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
GEN.41.26	The seven good cows, they are seven years, and the seven good ears of grain, they are seven years. The dreams are one. 
GEN.41.27	And the seven thin and ugly cows coming up after them, they are seven years, and the seven empty ears of grain, scorched by the east wind, they are also seven years of famine. 
GEN.41.28	This is the word that I have spoken to Pharaoh; God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
GEN.41.29	Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the whole land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.30	Then seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten. The famine will consume the land. 
GEN.41.31	Abundance in the land will not be known because of the famine that follows,
GEN.41.32	Now concerning the repetition of the dream twice to Pharaoh, it is because the matter is established by God, and God will do it quickly. 
GEN.41.33	Now then, let Pharaoh select a man who is discerning and wise, and let him set him over the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint supervisors over the land, and let him take one-fifth from the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance. 
GEN.41.35	Then let them gather all the food of these coming good years and let them pile up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. 
GEN.41.36	Then the food shall be as a deposit for the land for the seven years of the famine that will be in the land of Egypt, that the land will not perish on account of the famine.” 
GEN.41.37	And the plan
GEN.41.38	Then Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find a man like this in whom is the spirit of God?” 
GEN.41.39	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all of this known to you there is no one as discerning and wise as you. 
GEN.41.40	You shall be over my house, and to your word
GEN.41.41	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.42	Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his finger and put it on the finger of Joseph. And he clothed him with garments of fine linen, and he put a chain of gold around his neck. 
GEN.41.43	And he had him ride in his second chariot. And they cried out before him, “Kneel!” And Pharaoh set him over all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.44	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your consent no one will lift his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.45	And Pharaoh called the name of Joseph Zaphenath-paneah and gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, as a wife. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.46	Now Joseph was thirty years old
GEN.41.47	And the land produced a plenty in the seven years of abundance. 
GEN.41.48	And he gathered all the food of the seven years which occurred in the land of Egypt. And he stored the food in the cities. The food of the field that surrounded each city he stored in its midst. 
GEN.41.49	And Joseph piled up grain like the sand of the sea in great abundance until he stopped counting it, for it could not be counted.
GEN.41.50	Before the years of famine came, Asenath, daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore two sons to him. 
GEN.41.51	And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, for he said, “God has caused me to forget all my hardship and all my father’s house.” 
GEN.41.52	And the name of the second he called Ephraim, for he said, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my misfortune.” 
GEN.41.53	And the seven years of abundance which were in the land of Egypt came to an end. 
GEN.41.54	And the seven years of famine began to come as Joseph had said. And there was famine in all of the countries, but in the land of Egypt there was food. 
GEN.41.55	And when all the land of Egypt was hungry the people cried out to Pharaoh for food. And Pharaoh said to all the land of Egypt, “Go to Joseph; what he says to you, you must do.” 
GEN.41.56	And the famine was over the whole land, and Joseph opened all the storehouses
GEN.41.57	And every land came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, for the famine was severe in every land. 
GEN.42.1	When Jacob realized that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?” 
GEN.42.2	Then he said, “Look, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy grain for us there that we may live and not die.” 
GEN.42.3	And the ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
GEN.42.4	But Jacob did not send Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, for he feared harm would come to him.
GEN.42.5	Then the sons of Israel went to buy grain amid those other people who went as well, for there was famine in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.42.6	Now Joseph was the governor over the land. He was the one who sold food to all the people of the land. And the brothers of Joseph came and bowed down to him with their faces to the ground. 
GEN.42.7	And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger to them. And he spoke with them harshly and said to them, “From where have you come?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.” 
GEN.42.8	And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. 
GEN.42.9	And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed concerning them, and he said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land!” 
GEN.42.10	And they said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. 
GEN.42.11	We all are sons of one man. We are honest men. We, your servants, are not spies.” 
GEN.42.12	Then he said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.” 
GEN.42.13	Then they said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, but behold, the youngest is with our father today, and one is no more.” 
GEN.42.14	But Joseph said to them, “It is what I said to you—you are spies. 
GEN.42.15	By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh you will not go out from here unless your youngest brother comes here. 
GEN.42.16	Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, but you will be kept in prison so that your words might be tested to see if there is truth with you. And if not, by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.” 
GEN.42.17	Then he gathered them into the prison for three days. 
GEN.42.18	On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live; I fear God. 
GEN.42.19	If you are honest, let one of your brothers be kept in prison where you are now being kept,
GEN.42.20	You must bring your youngest brother to me, and then your words will be confirmed and you will not die.” And they did so. 
GEN.42.21	Then each said to his brother, “Surely we are guilty on account of our brother when we saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded for mercy to us and we would not listen. Therefore this trouble has come to us.” 
GEN.42.22	Then Reuben answered them, saying, “Did I not say to you, do not sin against the boy? But you did not listen, and now, behold, his blood has been sought.” 
GEN.42.23	Now they did not know that Joseph understood, for the interpreter was between them. 
GEN.42.24	And he turned away from them and wept. Then he returned to them and spoke to them, and took Simeon from them and tied him up in front of them. 
GEN.42.25	Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to return their money to each sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. Thus he did for them. 
GEN.42.26	Then they loaded their grain upon their donkeys and went away from there. 
GEN.42.27	And one of them later opened his sack to give fodder to his donkey at the lodging place and saw his money—behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. 
GEN.42.28	And he said to his brothers, “My money was returned and moreover, behold, it is in my sack!” Then their hearts failed them
GEN.42.29	And when they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan they told him everything that had happened to them, saying, 
GEN.42.30	“The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly to us and treated us as if we were spying out the land. 
GEN.42.31	But we said to him, ‘We are honest; we are not spies. 
GEN.42.32	We are twelve brothers, the sons of our father. One is no more and the youngest is with our father now in the land of Canaan.’ 
GEN.42.33	Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest. Leave one brother with me, and take food for the famine in your households and go. 
GEN.42.34	And bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies but you are honest. And I will give your brother back to you, and you will trade in the land.’ ” 
GEN.42.35	And it happened that when they emptied their sacks, behold, each one’s pouch of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw the pouches of their money, they were greatly distressed. 
GEN.42.36	And Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me—Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and Benjamin you would take! All of this is against me! 
GEN.42.37	Then Reuben said to his father, “You may kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hand and I myself will return him to you.” 
GEN.42.38	But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he alone remains. If harm meets him on the journey that you would take, you would bring down my gray head in sorrow to Sheol.” 
GEN.43.1	Now the famine in the land was severe. 
GEN.43.2	And it happened that as they finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt their father said to them, “Return and buy a little food for us.” 
GEN.43.3	Then Judah said to him, “The man solemnly admonished us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’ 
GEN.43.4	If you will send
GEN.43.5	but if you will not send
GEN.43.6	Then Israel said, “Why did you bring trouble to me by telling the man you still had a brother?” 
GEN.43.7	And they said, “The man asked explicitly about us and about our family, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have a brother?’ And we answered him according to these words. How could we know that he would say, ‘Bring down your brother’?” 
GEN.43.8	Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me, and let us arise and go, so that we will live and not die—you, we, and our children. 
GEN.43.9	I myself will be surety for him. You may seek him from my hand. If I do not bring him back to you and present him before you, then I will stand guilty before you forever. 
GEN.43.10	Surely if we had not hesitated by this time we would have returned twice.” 
GEN.43.11	Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so then do this. Take some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift—a little balm and honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, and pistachios and almonds. 
GEN.43.12	And take double the money in your hands. Take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake. 
GEN.43.13	And take your brother. Now arise and return to the man. 
GEN.43.14	And may El-Shaddai
GEN.43.15	So the men took this gift, and they took double money in their hands, and Benjamin, and they rose up and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph. 
GEN.43.16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them he said to the one who was over his household, “Bring the men into the house and slaughter and prepare an animal, for the men shall eat with me at noon.” 
GEN.43.17	And the man did as Joseph had said, and the man brought the men into the house of Joseph. 
GEN.43.18	And the men were afraid when they were brought into the house of Joseph. And they said “We were brought here on account of the money that was returned to our sacks the first time, that he might attack us and fall upon us to take us as slaves with our donkeys.” 
GEN.43.19	So they approached the man who was over Joseph’s house and spoke to him at the doorway of the house. 
GEN.43.20	And they said, “Please, my lord, we surely came down once before to buy food, 
GEN.43.21	but when we came to the place of lodging and we opened our sacks, then behold, each one’s money was in the mouth of his sack—our money in its full weight—so we have returned with it in our hands. 
GEN.43.22	Now, other money we have brought down in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.” 
GEN.43.23	And he said, “Peace to you; do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father must have given you a treasure in your sacks; your money came to me.” And he brought Simeon out to them. 
GEN.43.24	Then the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and he gave them water and washed their feet, and gave fodder to their donkeys. 
GEN.43.25	Then they laid out
GEN.43.26	And when Joseph came into the house they brought the gift that was in their hand into the house to him, and they bowed down before him to the ground. 
GEN.43.27	And he greeted them
GEN.43.28	And they said, “Your servant our father is well; he is still alive.” And they knelt and bowed down. 
GEN.43.29	Then he lifted up his eyes and saw Benjamin his brother, the son of his mother, and said, “Is this your youngest brother of whom you told me?” And he continued,
GEN.43.30	Then Joseph hurried away,
GEN.43.31	Then he washed his face and went out, now controlling himself, and said, “Serve the food.” 
GEN.43.32	And they served him
GEN.43.33	And they were seated before him from the firstborn according to his birthright to the youngest according to his youth. And the men looked at one another
GEN.43.34	And portions were served to them from his table,
GEN.44.1	Then he commanded the one who was over his household, saying, “Fill the sacks of the men with food as much as they are able to carry, and put each one’s money in the mouth of his sack. 
GEN.44.2	And my cup—the cup of silver—you shall put into the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and the money for his grain. And he did according to the word of Joseph that he had commanded. 
GEN.44.3	When the morning light came the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. 
GEN.44.4	They went out of the city, and had not gone far when Joseph said to the one who was over his house, “Arise! Pursue after the men and overtake them. Then you shall say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good? 
GEN.44.5	Is this not that from which my master drinks? Now he himself certainly practices divination with it. You have done evil in what you have done.’ ” 
GEN.44.6	When he overtook them he spoke these words to them. 
GEN.44.7	And they said to him, “Why has my lord spoken according to these words? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! 
GEN.44.8	Behold, the money that we found in the mouth of our sacks we returned to you from the land of Canaan. Now why would we steal silver or gold from the house of my lord? 
GEN.44.9	Whoever is found with it from among your servants shall die. And moreover, we will become slaves to my lord.” 
GEN.44.10	Then he said, “Now also according to your words, thus will it be. He who is found with it shall be my slave, but you shall be innocent.” 
GEN.44.11	Then each man quickly brought down his sack to the ground, and each one opened his sack. 
GEN.44.12	And he searched, beginning with the oldest and finishing with the youngest. And the cup was found in the sack of Benjamin. 
GEN.44.13	Then they tore their clothes, and each one loaded his donkey and they returned to the city. 
GEN.44.14	And Judah and his brothers came to the house of Joseph—now he was still there—they fell before him to the ground. 
GEN.44.15	Then Joseph said to them, “What is this deed that you have done? Did you not know that a man who is like me surely practices divination?” 
GEN.44.16	And Judah said, “What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? Now how can we show ourselves innocent? God has found the guilt of your servants! Behold, we are slaves to my lord, both we and also he in whose hand the cup was found.” 
GEN.44.17	But he said, “Far be it from me to do this! The man in whose hand the cup was found, he will become my slave. But as for you, go up in peace to your father.” 
GEN.44.18	But Judah drew near to him and said, “Please my lord, let your servant speak a word in the ears of my lord, and let not your anger burn
GEN.44.19	My lord had asked his servants, saying, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ 
GEN.44.20	And we said to my lord, ‘We have an aged father, and a younger brother, the child of his old age, and his brother died, and he alone remains from his mother, and his father loves him.’ 
GEN.44.21	Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me that I may set my eyes upon him.’ 
GEN.44.22	Then we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father; if he should leave his father, then he
GEN.44.23	Then you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not again see my face.’ 
GEN.44.24	And it happened that we went up to your servant, my father, and told him the words of my lord. 
GEN.44.25	And when our father said, ‘Buy a little food for us,’ 
GEN.44.26	then we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we shall go down. For we will not be able to see the face of the man unless our youngest brother is with us.’ 
GEN.44.27	Then your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You yourselves know that my wife bore two sons to me. 
GEN.44.28	One went out from me, and I said, “Surely he must have been torn to pieces,” and I have never seen him since. 
GEN.44.29	And if you take this one also from me, and he encounters harm, you will bring down my gray head in sorrow to Sheol.’ 
GEN.44.30	So now, when I come to your servant, my father, and the boy is not with us—now his life is bound up with his life—
GEN.44.31	it shall happen that when he sees that the boy is gone, he will die. And your servants will bring down the gray head of your servant, our father, to Sheol with sorrow. 
GEN.44.32	For your servant is pledged as surety for the boy by my father, saying, If I do not bring him to you, then I shall be culpable to my father forever. 
GEN.44.33	So then, please let your servant remain in place of the boy as a slave to my lord, and let the boy go up with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	For how can I go up to my father if the boy is not with me? I do not want to see
GEN.45.1	Then Joseph was not able to control himself before all who were standing by him. And he cried out, “Make every man go out from me!” So no one stood with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers. 
GEN.45.2	And he wept loudly,
GEN.45.3	Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” And his brothers were unable to answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence. 
GEN.45.4	So Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, please.” And they drew near. And he said, “I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 
GEN.45.5	So now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves
GEN.45.6	For these two years the famine has been in the midst of the land, but there will be five more years where there is no plowing or harvest. 
GEN.45.7	And God sent me before you all to preserve for you a remnant in the land and to keep alive among you many survivors. 
GEN.45.8	So now, you yourselves did not send me here, but God put me here as father to Pharaoh and as master of all his household, and a ruler over all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.45.9	Hurry, and go up to my father and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me and do not delay. 
GEN.45.10	You shall settle in the land of Goshen so that you will be near me, you and your children and your grandchildren, and your flocks and your herds and all that you have. 
GEN.45.11	And I will provide for you there, because there are still five years of famine—lest you and your household and all that you have become destitute.’ 
GEN.45.12	Now behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is I
GEN.45.13	And you must tell my father of all my honor in Egypt and all that you have seen. Now hurry and bring my father here.” 
GEN.45.14	Then he fell upon the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 
GEN.45.15	And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. And afterward his brothers spoke with him. 
GEN.45.16	Then the report was heard in the house of Pharaoh, saying, “Joseph’s brothers have come.” And it pleased Pharaoh and his servants. 
GEN.45.17	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers: ‘Do this—load your donkeys and go back to the land of Canaan, 
GEN.45.18	and take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.’ 
GEN.45.19	And you Joseph, are commanded to say this: ‘Do this! Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives, and bring your father and come! 
GEN.45.20	Do not worry
GEN.45.21	And the sons of Israel did so. And Joseph gave them wagons at the word of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey. 
GEN.45.22	To each and to all of them he gave sets of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of clothing. 
GEN.45.23	And to his father he sent as follows:
GEN.45.24	Then he sent his brothers away, and when they departed he said to them, “Do not be agitated on the journey.” 
GEN.45.25	So they went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father. 
GEN.45.26	And they spoke to him, saying, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” And his heart went numb,
GEN.45.27	Then they told him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them. And when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, then the spirit of Jacob their father revived. 
GEN.45.28	And Israel said, “It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.” 
GEN.46.1	So Israel journeyed with all that he had, and he came to Beersheba and offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac. 
GEN.46.2	And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, “Jacob, Jacob.” And he said, “Here I am.” 
GEN.46.3	Then he said, “I am the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you a great nation there. 
GEN.46.4	I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I myself will also bring you up. And Joseph will place his hand over your eyes.” 
GEN.46.5	So Jacob arose from Beersheba. And the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob, and their little ones and their wives in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to transport him. 
GEN.46.6	And they took their livestock and their possessions that they had acquired in the land of Canaan. And they came to Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him, 
GEN.46.7	his sons and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters and his daughters’ daughters with him, into Egypt. 
GEN.46.8	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons. Reuben, the firstborn of Jacob 
GEN.46.9	and the sons of Reuben: Enoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 
GEN.46.10	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. 
GEN.46.11	The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
GEN.46.12	The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. 
GEN.46.13	The sons of Issachar: Tolah, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron. 
GEN.46.14	The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 
GEN.46.15	These are the sons of Leah that she bore to Jacob in Paddan-Aram, and Dinah his daughter. His sons and daughters were thirty-three persons in all. 
GEN.46.16	The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. 
GEN.46.17	The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah, and their sister Serah. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malkiel. 
GEN.46.18	There are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob—sixteen persons. 
GEN.46.19	The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.46.20	And Ephraim and Manasseh, whom Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On bore to him, were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt. 
GEN.46.21	The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. 
GEN.46.22	These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob—fourteen persons in all. 
GEN.46.23	The sons of Dan: Hushim. 
GEN.46.24	The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 
GEN.46.25	These are the sons of Bilhah whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob—seven persons in all. 
GEN.46.26	All the persons belonging to Jacob who came to Egypt who were his descendants,
GEN.46.27	And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt were two persons. All the persons of the house of Jacob who came to Egypt were seventy. 
GEN.46.28	He
GEN.46.29	Then Joseph harnessed his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen. He presented himself to him and fell upon his neck and wept upon his neck a long time. 
GEN.46.30	Then Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die since I have seen your face, for you are still alive.” 
GEN.46.31	Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and report to Pharaoh, and I will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Canaan have come to me. 
GEN.46.32	And the men are shepherds, for they are men of livestock, and they have brought their flocks and their cattle and all that they have.’ 
GEN.46.33	And it shall be that when Pharaoh calls you he will say, ‘What is your occupation?’ 
GEN.46.34	Then you must say, ‘You servants are men of livestock from our childhood until now, both we and also our ancestors,’
GEN.47.1	So Joseph went and reported to Pharaoh. And he said, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and their herds, and all that they have, have come from the land of Canaan. Now they are here in the land of Goshen.” 
GEN.47.2	And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them before Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.3	And Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are keepers of sheep, both we and also our ancestors.”
GEN.47.4	And they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servant’s flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. So now, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.” 
GEN.47.5	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. 
GEN.47.6	The land of Egypt is before you. Settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land. Let them live in the land of Goshen, and if you know there is among them men of ability, then appoint them overseers of my own livestock.” 
GEN.47.7	Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.8	Then Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How old are you?”
GEN.47.9	And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my sojourning are one hundred and thirty years. Few and hard have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not reached the days of the years of the lives of my ancestors
GEN.47.10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and he went out from the presence of Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.11	And Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and he gave them property in the land of Egypt in the best part of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had instructed. 
GEN.47.12	And Joseph provided his father and his brothers and all the household of his father with food, according to the number of their children. 
GEN.47.13	Now there was no food in all the land, for the famine was very severe. And the land of Egypt languished, with the land of Canaan, on account of the famine. 
GEN.47.14	And Joseph collected all the money found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan in exchange for the grain that they were buying. And Joseph brought the money into the house of Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.15	And when the money was spent in the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan, all of Egypt came to Joseph, saying, “Give us food! Why should we die before you? For the money is used up.” 
GEN.47.16	And Joseph said, “Give your livestock and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock if your money is used up.” 
GEN.47.17	So they brought their herds to Joseph, and Joseph gave food to them in exchange for horses, their flocks, and their cattle and donkeys. And he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year. 
GEN.47.18	When that year ended, they came to him in the following year and said to him, “We cannot hide from my lord that our money and livestock belong to my lord. Nothing remains before my lord except our bodies and our land. 
GEN.47.19	Why should we die in front of you, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, then we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Then give us seed and we shall live and not die, and the land will not become desolate.” 
GEN.47.20	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for each Egyptian sold his field, for the famine was severe upon them. And the land became Pharaoh’s. 
GEN.47.21	As for the people, he transferred them to the cities, from one end of the territory of Egypt to the other. 
GEN.47.22	Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for there was an allotment for the priests from Pharaoh, and they lived on
GEN.47.23	And Joseph said to the people, “Look, I have bought you and your land this day for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you so you can sow the land. 
GEN.47.24	And it shall happen that at the harvest, you must give a fifth to Pharaoh and four-fifths shall be yours, as seed for the field and for your food and for those who are in your households, and as food for your little ones.” 
GEN.47.25	And they said, “You have saved our lives. If we have found favor in the eyes of my lord, we will be servants to Pharaoh.” 
GEN.47.26	So Joseph made it a statute unto this day concerning the land of Egypt: one fifth to Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests alone did not belong to Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.27	So Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they acquired possessions in it and were fruitful and multiplied greatly. 
GEN.47.28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. And the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred and forty-seven years. 
GEN.47.29	When the time of Israel’s death drew near,
GEN.47.30	but let me lie with my ancestors.
GEN.47.31	Then he said, “Swear to me.” And he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself on the head of the bed. 
GEN.48.1	And it happened that after these things, it was said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is ill.” And he took his two sons with him, Ephraim and Manasseh. 
GEN.48.2	And it was told to Jacob, “Behold, your son Joseph has come to you.” Then Israel strengthened himself and he sat up in the bed. 
GEN.48.3	Then Jacob said to Joseph, “El-Shaddai
GEN.48.4	and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and make you numerous, and will make you a company of nations. And I will give this land to your offspring after you as an everlasting possession.’ 
GEN.48.5	And now, your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt before my coming to you in Egypt, are mine. Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine as Reuben and Simeon are. 
GEN.48.6	And your children whom you father after them shall be yours. By the name of their brothers they shall be called, with respect to their inheritance. 
GEN.48.7	As for me, when I came to Paddan-Aram Rachel died to my sorrow
GEN.48.8	When Israel saw the sons of Joseph he said, “Who are these?” 
GEN.48.9	Then Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons whom God has given me here.” And he said, “Please bring them to me that I may bless them.” 
GEN.48.10	Now the eyes of Israel were dim
GEN.48.11	And Israel said to Joseph, “I did not expect to see your face and behold, God has also shown me your offspring.” 
GEN.48.12	Then Joseph removed them from his knees and bowed down with his face to the ground. 
GEN.48.13	And Joseph took the two of them, Ephraim at his right to the left of Israel, and Manasseh at his left to the right of Israel. And he brought them near to him. 
GEN.48.14	And Israel stretched out his right hand and put it on the head of Ephraim (now he was the younger), and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands, for Manasseh was the firstborn. 
GEN.48.15	And he blessed Joseph and said, 
GEN.48.15	“The God before whom my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, walked, 
GEN.48.15	The God who shepherded me all my life
GEN.48.16	The angel who redeemed me from all evil, 
GEN.48.16	may he bless the boys. 
GEN.48.16	And through them let my name be perpetuated,
GEN.48.16	and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac. 
GEN.48.16	And let them multiply into many in the midst of the earth. 
GEN.48.17	When Joseph saw that his father put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, he was displeased. And he took hold of his father’s hand to remove it from the head of Ephraim over to the head of Manasseh. 
GEN.48.18	And Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father; because this one is the firstborn. Put your right hand upon his head.” 
GEN.48.19	But his father refused and said, “I know, my son; I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great, but his younger brother shall be greater than him, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations.” 
GEN.48.20	So he blessed them that day, saying, 
GEN.48.20	Through you Israel shall pronounce blessing, saying, 
GEN.48.20	‘May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.’ ” 
GEN.48.20	So he put Ephraim before Manasseh. 
GEN.48.21	And Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your ancestors.
GEN.48.22	And I have given to you one slope of land rather than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorites by my sword and with my bow.” 
GEN.49.1	Then Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather together so that I can tell you what will happen with you in days to come.
GEN.49.2	Assemble and hear, O sons of Jacob! 
GEN.49.2	Listen to Israel your father! 
GEN.49.3	Reuben, you are my firstborn, 
GEN.49.3	my strength, and the firstfruit of my vigor, 
GEN.49.3	excelling in rank and excelling in power. 
GEN.49.4	Unstable
GEN.49.4	for you went up upon the bed of your father, 
GEN.49.4	then defiled it. You went up upon my couch! 
GEN.49.5	Simeon and Levi are brothers; 
GEN.49.5	weapons of violence are their swords. 
GEN.49.5	Let me
GEN.49.6	Let not my person
GEN.49.6	For in their anger they killed men, 
GEN.49.6	and at their pleasure they hamstrung cattle. 
GEN.49.7	Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, 
GEN.49.7	and their wrath, for it is cruel. 
GEN.49.7	I will divide them in Jacob, 
GEN.49.7	and I will scatter them in Israel. 
GEN.49.8	Judah, as for you, your brothers shall praise you. 
GEN.49.8	Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies. 
GEN.49.8	The sons of your father shall bow down to you. 
GEN.49.9	Judah is a lion’s cub. 
GEN.49.9	From the prey, my son, you have gone up. 
GEN.49.9	He bowed down; he crouched like a lion and as a lioness. 
GEN.49.9	Who shall rouse him? 
GEN.49.10	The scepter shall not depart from Judah, 
GEN.49.10	nor the ruler’s staff between his feet, 
GEN.49.10	until Shiloh comes. 
GEN.49.10	And to him shall be the obedience of nations. 
GEN.49.11	Binding his donkey to the vine 
GEN.49.11	and his donkey’s colt to the choice vine, 
GEN.49.11	he washes his clothing in the wine 
GEN.49.11	and his garment in the blood of grapes. 
GEN.49.12	The eyes are darker than wine, 
GEN.49.12	and the teeth whiter than milk. 
GEN.49.13	Zebulun shall settle by the shore of the sea. 
GEN.49.13	He shall become a haven for ships, 
GEN.49.13	and his border shall be at Sidon. 
GEN.49.14	Issachar is a strong donkey, 
GEN.49.14	crouching between the sheepfolds. 
GEN.49.15	He saw a resting place that was good, 
GEN.49.15	and land that was pleasant. 
GEN.49.15	So he bowed his shoulder to the burden 
GEN.49.15	and became a servant of forced labor. 
GEN.49.16	Dan shall judge his people 
GEN.49.16	as one of the tribes of Israel. 
GEN.49.17	Dan shall be a serpent on the way, 
GEN.49.17	a viper on the road 
GEN.49.17	that bites the heels of a horse, 
GEN.49.17	so that its rider falls backward. 
GEN.49.18	I wait for your salvation, O Yahweh. 
GEN.49.19	Bandits shall attack Gad, 
GEN.49.19	but he shall attack their heels. 
GEN.49.20	Asher’s food is delicious, 
GEN.49.20	and he shall provide from the king’s delicacies. 
GEN.49.21	Naphtali is a doe running free 
GEN.49.21	that puts forth beautiful words. 
GEN.49.22	Joseph is the bough
GEN.49.22	a fruitful bough
GEN.49.22	His branches climb over the wall. 
GEN.49.23	The archers
GEN.49.23	They shot arrows at him and were hostile to him. 
GEN.49.24	But his bow remained in a steady position; 
GEN.49.24	his arms
GEN.49.24	by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob. 
GEN.49.24	From there is the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel. 
GEN.49.25	Because of the God of your father he will help you 
GEN.49.25	and by Shaddai
GEN.49.25	with the blessings of heaven above, 
GEN.49.25	blessings of the deep that crouches beneath, 
GEN.49.25	blessings of the breasts and the womb. 
GEN.49.26	The blessings of your father 
GEN.49.26	are superior to the blessings of my ancestors, 
GEN.49.26	to the bounty of the everlasting hills. 
GEN.49.26	May they be on the head of Joseph, 
GEN.49.26	and on the forehead of the prince of his brothers. 
GEN.49.27	Benjamin is a devouring wolf, 
GEN.49.27	devouring the prey in the morning, 
GEN.49.27	and dividing the plunder in the evening. 
GEN.49.28	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, each according to their blessing. 
GEN.49.29	Then he instructed them and said to them, “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me among my ancestors
GEN.49.30	in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah that is before
GEN.49.31	There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife. And there I buried Leah—
GEN.49.32	the purchase of the field and the cave which was in it from the Hittites.” 
GEN.49.33	When Jacob finished instructing his sons he drew his feet up to the bed. Then he took his last breath and was gathered to his people. 
GEN.50.1	Then Joseph fell on the face of his father and wept upon him and kissed him. 
GEN.50.2	And Joseph instructed his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel. 
GEN.50.3	Forty days were required for it,
GEN.50.4	When the days of his weeping had passed, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the hearing of Pharaoh, saying, 
GEN.50.5	‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am about to die. In the tomb that I have hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan—there you must bury me.” So then, please let me go up and let me bury my father; then I will return.’ ” 
GEN.50.6	Then Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father as he made you swear.” 
GEN.50.7	So Joseph went up to bury his father. And all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, went up with him, 
GEN.50.8	with all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and the household of his father. They left only their little children and their flocks and their herds in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	And there also went up with him chariots and horsemen. The company was very great. 
GEN.50.10	When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which was beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful wailing. And he made a mourning ceremony for his father seven days. 
GEN.50.11	And when the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, saw the mourning ceremony at the threshing floor of Atad they said, “This is a severe mourning for the Egyptians.” Therefore its name was called Abel-Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
GEN.50.12	Thus his sons did to him just as he had instructed them. 
GEN.50.13	And his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which field Abraham had bought as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite before
GEN.50.14	And after burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father. 
GEN.50.15	And when the brothers of Joseph saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hold a grudge against us and pay us back dearly for all the evil that we did to him.” 
GEN.50.16	So they sent word to Joseph saying, “Your father commanded us before his death, saying, 
GEN.50.17	“Thus you must say to Joseph, ‘O, please now forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did evil to you.’ So now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” And Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 
GEN.50.18	Then his brothers went also and fell before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.” 
GEN.50.19	Then Joseph said to them, “Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God? 
GEN.50.20	As for you, you planned evil against me, but God planned it for good, in order to do this—to keep many people alive—as it is today. 
GEN.50.21	So then, do not be afraid. I myself will provide for you and your little ones. And he consoled them and spoke kindly
GEN.50.22	So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and the house of his father. And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years. 
GEN.50.23	And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation. Moreover, the children of Makir, son of Manasseh, were born on the knees of Joseph. 
GEN.50.24	And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will certainly visit you and bring you up from this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” 
GEN.50.25	Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall bring up my bones from here.” 
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old. They embalmed him and he was placed in a coffin in Egypt. 
EXO.1.1	And these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt; with Jacob, they each came with his family:
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 
EXO.1.4	Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 
EXO.1.5	And all those who descended from Jacob
EXO.1.6	And Joseph died and all of his brothers and all of that generation. 
EXO.1.7	And the Israelites
EXO.1.8	And a new king rose over Egypt who did not know Joseph. 
EXO.1.9	And he said to his people, “Look, the people of the Israelites
EXO.1.10	Come, we must deal shrewdly with them, lest they become many, and when war happens, they also will join our enemies and will fight against us and go up from the land.” 
EXO.1.11	And they appointed commanders of forced labor over them in order to oppress them with their forced labor,
EXO.1.12	And as he oppressed them, so they became many, and so they spread out, and the Egyptians were afraid because of the presence of the Israelites.
EXO.1.13	And the Egyptians ruthlessly compelled the Israelites
EXO.1.14	And they made their lives bitter with hard work with mortar and with bricks and with all sorts of work in the field—with all their work in which they ruthlessly enslaved them. 
EXO.1.15	And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives—of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah and the name of the second was Puah—
EXO.1.16	and he said, “When you help the Hebrews give birth, you will look upon the pairs of testicles; if he is a son, you will put him to death, and if she is a daughter, she will live.” 
EXO.1.17	But the midwives feared God, and they did not do as the king of Egypt had said to them. They let the boys live. 
EXO.1.18	And the king of Egypt summoned the midwives, and he said to them, “Why have you done this thing and let the boys live?” 
EXO.1.19	And the midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, because they are vigorous; before the midwife comes to them, they have given birth.” 
EXO.1.20	And God did the midwives good, and the Israelite people became many and were very numerous. 
EXO.1.21	And so
EXO.1.22	And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “Every son who is born you will throw into the Nile, and every daughter you will let live.” 
EXO.2.1	And a man from the family
EXO.2.2	And the woman conceived, and she gave birth to a son, and she saw him, that he was a fine baby, and she hid him three months. 
EXO.2.3	But when she could no longer hide him, she got a papyrus basket for him, and she coated it with tar and with pitch, and she placed the boy in it, and she placed it among the reeds on the bank of the Nile. 
EXO.2.4	And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him. 
EXO.2.5	And the daughter of Pharaoh went down to wash at the Nile, while her maidservants were walking alongside the Nile, and she saw the basket in the midst of the reeds, and she sent her slave woman for it and took it 
EXO.2.6	and opened it and saw him—the boy—and it was a lad weeping, and she had compassion for him and said, “This must be from the boys of the Hebrews.”
EXO.2.7	And his sister said to the daughter of Pharaoh, “Shall I go and call for you a woman from the Hebrews who is nursing so that she will nurse the boy for you?” 
EXO.2.8	And the daughter of Pharaoh said to her, “Go.” And the girl went, and she called the mother of the boy. 
EXO.2.9	And the daughter of Pharaoh said, “Take this boy and nurse him for me, and I myself will give you wages, and the woman took the boy, and she nursed him. 
EXO.2.10	And the boy grew, and she brought him to the daughter of Pharaoh, and he became her son, and she called his name Moses, and she said, “Because I drew him out from the water.” 
EXO.2.11	And then
EXO.2.12	And he turned here and there, and he saw no one,
EXO.2.13	And he went out on the second day, and there were two Hebrew men fighting, and he said to the guilty one, “Why do you strike your neighbor?” 
EXO.2.14	And he said, “Who appointed you as a commander
EXO.2.15	And Pharaoh heard this matter, and he sought to kill Moses, and Moses fled from Pharaoh, and he lived in the land of Midian, and he lived at a certain well.
EXO.2.16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
EXO.2.17	And the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and came to their rescue and watered their flock. 
EXO.2.18	And they came to Reuel, their father, and he said, “Why have you come so quickly
EXO.2.19	And they said, “An Egyptian man delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and he even drew water for us and watered the flock.” 
EXO.2.20	And he said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why then
EXO.2.21	And Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses. 
EXO.2.22	And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom because he said, “I am an alien in a foreign land.”
EXO.2.23	And then
EXO.2.24	And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob, 
EXO.2.25	and God saw the Israelites,
EXO.3.1	And Moses was a shepherd with the flock
EXO.3.2	And the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush, and he looked, and there was the bush burning with fire, but the bush was not being consumed. 
EXO.3.3	And Moses said, “Let me turn aside and see this great sight. Why does the bush not burn up?” 
EXO.3.4	And Yahweh saw that he turned aside to see, and God called to him from the midst of the bush, and he said, “Moses, Moses.” And he said, “Here I am.” 
EXO.3.5	And he said, “You must not come near to here. Take off your sandals from on your feet, because the place on which you are standing, it is holy ground.” 
EXO.3.6	And he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face because he was afraid of looking at God. 
EXO.3.7	And Yahweh said, “Surely I have seen the misery of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their cry of distress because of their oppressors, for I know their sufferings. 
EXO.3.8	And I have come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up from this land to a good and wide land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites
EXO.3.9	And now, look, the cry of distress of the Israelites
EXO.3.10	And now come, and I will send you to Pharaoh, and you must bring my people, the Israelites,
EXO.3.11	But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the Israelites
EXO.3.12	And he said, “Because I am with you, and this will be the sign for you that I myself have sent you: When you bring the people out from Egypt, you will serve God on this mountain.” 
EXO.3.13	But Moses said to God, “Look, if I go to the Israelites
EXO.3.14	And God said to Moses, “I am that I am.” And he said, “So you must say to the Israelites,
EXO.3.15	And God said again to Moses, “So you must say to the Israelites,
EXO.3.16	Go and gather the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,
EXO.3.17	And I said, “I will bring you up from the misery of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites
EXO.3.18	And they will listen to your voice, and you will go, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you will say to him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews has met with us, and now let us please go on a journey of three days into the desert, and let us sacrifice to Yahweh our God.’ 
EXO.3.19	But I myself know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go unless compelled by a strong hand.
EXO.3.20	And I will stretch out my hand, and I will strike Egypt with all of my wonders that I will do in its midst, and afterward
EXO.3.21	And I will give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, and then
EXO.3.22	And a woman will ask from her neighbor and from the woman dwelling as an alien in her house for objects of silver and objects of gold and garments, and you will put them on your sons and on your daughters; and you will plunder Egypt.” 
EXO.4.1	And Moses answered, and he said, “And if they do not believe me and they do not listen to my voice, but they say, ‘Yahweh did not appear to you?’ ” 
EXO.4.2	And Yahweh said to him, “What is this in your hand?” And he said, “A staff.” 
EXO.4.3	And he said, “Throw it onto the ground.” And he threw it onto the ground, and it became a snake, and Moses fled from it. 
EXO.4.4	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Reach out your hand and grasp it by its tail”—” (And he reached out his hand and grabbed it, and it became a staff in his palm.)—
EXO.4.5	“so that they may believe that Yahweh, the God of their ancestors,
EXO.4.6	And Yahweh said to him again, “Put your hand into the fold of your garment.” And he put his hand into the fold of his garment, and he took it out, and, to his surprise,
EXO.4.7	And he said, “Return your hand to the fold of your garment.” And he returned his hand to the fold of his garment, and he took it out from the fold of his garment, and, to his surprise,
EXO.4.8	“And
EXO.4.9	And
EXO.4.10	And Moses said to Yahweh, “Please, Lord, I am not a man of words, neither recently nor in the past nor since your speaking
EXO.4.11	And Yahweh said to him, “Who gave a mouth to humankind, or who makes mute or deaf or sighted or blind? Is it not I, Yahweh? 
EXO.4.12	So then go, and I myself will be with your mouth, and I will teach you what you must speak.” 
EXO.4.13	And he said, “Please, Lord, do send anyone else whom you wish to send.”
EXO.4.14	And Yahweh was angry with
EXO.4.15	And you will speak to him, and you will put words in his mouth, and I myself will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what you must do. 
EXO.4.16	And he will speak for you to the people, and then
EXO.4.17	And you must take this staff in your hand, with which you will do the signs.” 
EXO.4.18	And Moses went, and he returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and he said to him, “Please let me go, and let me return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and let me see whether they are yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” 
EXO.4.19	And Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, “Go, return to Egypt because all the men have died who were seeking your life.” 
EXO.4.20	And Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on the donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt, and Moses took the staff of God in his hand. 
EXO.4.21	And Yahweh said to Moses, “When you go to return to Egypt, see all of the wonders that I have put in your hand, and do them before Pharaoh, and I myself will harden his heart, and he will not release the people. 
EXO.4.22	And you must say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Israel is my son, my firstborn.” 
EXO.4.23	And I said to you, “Release my son and let him serve me,” but you refused to release him. Look, I am about to kill your son, your firstborn.’ ” 
EXO.4.24	And
EXO.4.25	But Zipporah took a flint knife, and she cut off the foreskin of her son, and she touched his feet, and she said, “Yes, you are a bridegroom of blood to me.” 
EXO.4.26	And he left him alone. At that time she said, “A bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.
EXO.4.27	And Yahweh said to Aaron, “Go to the desert to meet Moses.” And he went and encountered him at the mountain of God and kissed him. 
EXO.4.28	And Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh, who had sent him—and all the signs that he had commanded him. 
EXO.4.29	And Moses and Aaron went, and they gathered all of the elders of the Israelites.
EXO.4.30	And Aaron spoke all the words that Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and he did the signs before the eyes of the people. 
EXO.4.31	And the people believed when they heard that Yahweh had attended to the Israelites
EXO.5.1	And afterward, Moses and Aaron went, and they said to Pharaoh, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, ‘Release my people so that they may hold a festival for me in the desert.’ ” 
EXO.5.2	And Pharaoh said, “Who is Yahweh that I should listen to his voice to release Israel? I do not know Yahweh, and also I will not release Israel.” 
EXO.5.3	And they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go on a three-day journey into the desert, and let us sacrifice to Yahweh our God, lest he strike us with plague or with sword.” 
EXO.5.4	And the king of Egypt said, “Why, Moses and Aaron, do you take
EXO.5.5	And Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now many, and you want to stop them from their forced labor.”
EXO.5.6	And on that day Pharaoh commanded the slave drivers over the people and his foremen, saying, 
EXO.5.7	“You must no longer give straw to the people to make the bricks like before.
EXO.5.8	But the quota of the bricks that they were making before
EXO.5.9	Let the work be heavier on the men so that they will do it and not pay attention to words of deception.” 
EXO.5.10	And the slave drivers of the people and their foremen went out, and they spoke to the people, saying, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I am not giving you straw. 
EXO.5.11	You go, get straw for yourselves from whatever you find because not a thing is being reduced from your work.’ ” 
EXO.5.12	And the people spread out in all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for the straw. 
EXO.5.13	And the slave drivers were insisting, saying, “Finish your work for each day
EXO.5.14	And the foremen of the Israelites,
EXO.5.15	And the foremen of the Israelites
EXO.5.16	Straw is not being given to your servants, but they are saying to us, ‘Make bricks!’ and, look, your servants are being beaten, but it is the fault of
EXO.5.17	And he said, “You are lazy, lazy! Therefore you are saying, ‘Let us go; let us sacrifice to Yahweh.’ 
EXO.5.18	And now go, work, but straw will not be given to you, and you must give the full quota of bricks.” 
EXO.5.19	And the foremen of the Israelites
EXO.5.20	And they met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting to meet them when they were going out from Pharaoh. 
EXO.5.21	And they said to them, “May Yahweh look upon you and judge because you have caused our fragrance to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants so as to put a sword into their hand to kill us.” 
EXO.5.22	And Moses returned to Yahweh and said, “Lord, why have you brought trouble to this people? Why ever did you send me? 
EXO.5.23	And from the time I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble to this people, and you have certainly not delivered your people.” 
EXO.6.1	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, because with a strong hand he will release them, and with a strong hand he will drive them out from his land.” 
EXO.6.2	And God spoke to Moses, and he said to him, “I am Yahweh. 
EXO.6.3	And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Shaddai,
EXO.6.4	And I not only established my covenant with them to give to them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, in which they dwelt as aliens, 
EXO.6.5	but also I myself heard the groaning of the Israelites,
EXO.6.6	Therefore say to the Israelites,
EXO.6.7	And I will take you as my people,
EXO.6.8	And I will bring you to the land that I swore
EXO.6.9	And Moses spoke thus to the Israelites,
EXO.6.10	And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
EXO.6.11	“Go, speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and let him release the Israelites
EXO.6.12	And Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, “Look, the Israelites
EXO.6.13	And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and he commanded them to go to the Israelites

EXO.6.26	It was that Aaron and Moses to whom Yahweh said, “Bring the Israelites
EXO.6.27	They were those who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, in order to bring the Israelites
EXO.6.28	And so it was on a certain day
EXO.6.29	And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, “I am Yahweh. Speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, all that I am speaking to you.” 
EXO.6.30	And Moses said before Yahweh, “Look, I am a poor speaker.
EXO.7.1	And Yahweh said to Moses, “See, I have made you as a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother will be your prophet. 
EXO.7.2	You will speak all that I will command you, and Aaron your brother will speak to Pharaoh, and he will release the Israelites
EXO.7.3	And I myself will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and I will make my signs and my wonders numerous in the land of Egypt. 
EXO.7.4	And Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I will put my hand into Egypt and bring out my divisions, my people, the Israelites,
EXO.7.5	And the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I stretch out my hand over Egypt and bring the Israelites
EXO.7.6	And Moses and Aaron did it; as Yahweh commanded them, so they did. 
EXO.7.7	(And Moses was eighty years old,
EXO.7.8	And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
EXO.7.9	“When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, ‘Do a wonder for yourselves,’ you will say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it before Pharaoh, and it will become a snake.’ ” 
EXO.7.10	And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and they did so, as Yahweh had commanded. And Aaron threw his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a snake. 
EXO.7.11	And Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did likewise with their secret arts. 
EXO.7.12	Each threw down his staff, and they became snakes, and Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs. 
EXO.7.13	And Pharaoh’s heart was hard, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had said. 
EXO.7.14	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is insensitive;
EXO.7.15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Look, he is going out to the water, and you must wait to meet him on the bank of the Nile, and you must take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake. 
EXO.7.16	And you must say to him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, “Release my people that they may serve me in the desert, and, look, you have not listened until now.” 
EXO.7.17	Thus says Yahweh, “By this you will know that I am Yahweh. Look, I am about to strike with the staff that is in my hand the water that is in the Nile, and it will be changed to blood. 
EXO.7.18	And the fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink water from the Nile.” ’ ” 
EXO.7.19	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch your hand out over the waters of Egypt and over their rivers, over their canals, and over their pools and over all of their reservoirs of water, so that they become blood,’ and blood will be in all the land of Egypt and in vessels of wood and of stone.” 
EXO.7.20	And Moses and Aaron did so, as Yahweh had commanded, and he raised the staff and struck the water that was in the Nile before the eyes of Pharaoh and before the eyes of his servants, and all of the water that was in the Nile was changed to blood. 
EXO.7.21	And the fish that were in the Nile died, and the Nile stank, and the Egyptians were not able to drink water from the Nile, and the blood was in all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.7.22	And the magicians of Egypt did likewise with their secret arts, and Pharaoh’s heart was hard, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken. 
EXO.7.23	And Pharaoh turned and went to his house, and he did not take also this to heart.
EXO.7.24	And all of the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, because they were unable to drink from the water of the Nile. 
EXO.7.25	And seven days passed after Yahweh struck the Nile. 
EXO.8.1	 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Release my people so that they may serve me.” 
EXO.8.2	And if you are refusing to release, look, I am going to plague all of your territory with frogs. 
EXO.8.3	And the Nile will swarm with frogs, and they will go up and come into your house and into your bedroom
EXO.8.4	And the frogs will go up against you and against your people and against all of your servants.’ ” 
EXO.8.5	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the canals, and over the pools, and bring up the frogs on the land of Egypt.’ ” 
EXO.8.6	And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs went up and covered the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.7	And the magicians did likewise with their secret arts, and they brought up frogs over the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.8	And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to Yahweh, and let him remove the frogs from me and from my people, and let me release the people so that they can sacrifice to Yahweh.” 
EXO.8.9	And Moses said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honor
EXO.8.10	And he said, “Tomorrow.” And he said, “Let it be according to your word so that you will know that there is no one like Yahweh our God. 
EXO.8.11	And the frogs will depart from you and from your house and from your servants. They will be left only in the Nile.” 
EXO.8.12	And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried out to Yahweh over the matter of the frogs that he had brought on Pharaoh. 
EXO.8.13	And Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died from the houses, from the courtyards, and from the fields. 
EXO.8.14	And they piled them in countless heaps,
EXO.8.15	And Pharaoh saw that there was relief, and he made his heart insensitive,
EXO.8.16	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the land, and it will become gnats
EXO.8.17	And he did so, and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and he struck the dust of the land, and it became gnats on the humans and on the animals; all of the dust of the land became gnats in all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.18	And the magicians did so with their secret arts to bring out the gnats, but they were not able, and the gnats were on the humans and on the animals. 
EXO.8.19	And the magicians said to Pharaoh, “It is the finger of God.” But the heart of Pharaoh was hard, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken. 
EXO.8.20	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Start early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh. Look, he is going out to the water, and you must say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Release my people so that they may serve me.” 
EXO.8.21	But if you are not about to release my people, look, I am about to send out flies among you and among your servants and among your people and in your houses; and the houses of Egypt will fill up with the flies and also the ground that they are on. 
EXO.8.22	But on that day I will distinguish
EXO.8.23	And I will put a distinction between my people and your people; this sign will be tomorrow.’ ” 
EXO.8.24	And Yahweh did so, and a severe
EXO.8.25	And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and he said, “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.” 
EXO.8.26	And Moses said, “To do so is not right, because we will sacrifice to Yahweh our God a thing detestable to the Egyptians. Look, if we sacrifice before their eyes the thing detestable to the Egyptians, will they not stone us? 
EXO.8.27	We will go a journey of three days into the desert, and we will sacrifice to Yahweh our God according to what he says to us.” 
EXO.8.28	And Pharaoh said, “I myself will release you, and you will sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the desert. Only surely you must not go far. Pray for me.” 
EXO.8.29	And Moses said, “Look, I am going out from you, and I will pray to Yahweh so that the flies depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh again deceive us by not releasing the people to sacrifice to Yahweh.” 
EXO.8.30	And Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to Yahweh. 
EXO.8.31	And Yahweh did according to the word of Moses and removed the flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; not one was left. 
EXO.8.32	And Pharaoh made his heart insensitive
EXO.9.1	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, “Release my people so that they may serve me.” 
EXO.9.2	But if you are refusing to release and you still are keeping hold of them, 
EXO.9.3	look, the hand of Yahweh is about to be present with a very severe
EXO.9.4	But Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, and not a thing will die from all that belongs to the Israelites.’ ”
EXO.9.5	And Yahweh set an appointed time, saying, “Tomorrow Yahweh will do this thing in the land.” 
EXO.9.6	And Yahweh did this thing the next day; all the livestock of Egypt died, but from the livestock of the Israelites
EXO.9.7	And Pharaoh sent to check, and it turned out
EXO.9.8	And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, “Take for yourselves full handfuls of soot from a smelting furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heavens before the eyes of Pharaoh. 
EXO.9.9	And it will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and it will become on humans and on animals a skin sore sprouting blisters in all the land of Egypt.” 
EXO.9.10	And they took the soot of the smelting furnace, and they stood before Pharaoh, and Moses sprinkled it toward the heavens, and it became skin sores sprouting blisters on humans and on animals. 
EXO.9.11	And the magicians were not able to stand before Moses because of the skin sores, for the skin sores were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians. 
EXO.9.12	And Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses. 
EXO.9.13	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Start early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh. Look, he is going out to the water, and you must say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, “Release my people so that they may serve me. 
EXO.9.14	For at this time I am sending all of my plagues to you personally
EXO.9.15	For now I could have stretched out my hand, and I could have struck you and your people with the plague, and you would have perished from the earth. 
EXO.9.16	But for the sake of this I have caused you to stand—for the sake of showing you my strength and in order to proclaim my name in all the earth. 
EXO.9.17	Still you are behaving haughtily to my people by not releasing them. 
EXO.9.18	Look, about this time tomorrow, I am going to cause very severe
EXO.9.19	And now send word; bring into safety your livestock and all that belongs to you in the field. The hail will come down on every human and animal that is found in the field and not gathered into the house, and they will die.” ’ ” 
EXO.9.20	Anyone from the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of Yahweh caused his servants and livestock to flee to the houses. 
EXO.9.21	But whoever did not give regard to
EXO.9.22	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand to the heavens, and let there be hail in all the land of Egypt, on human and on animal and on all the vegetation of the field in the land of Egypt.” 
EXO.9.23	And Moses stretched out his staff to the heavens, and Yahweh gave thunder
EXO.9.24	And there was hail, and fire was flashing back and forth in the midst of the very severe hail, the like of which was not in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation. 
EXO.9.25	And the hail struck in all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, from human to animal, and the hail struck all the vegetation of the field and smashed every tree of the field. 
EXO.9.26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites
EXO.9.27	And Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them, “I have sinned this time. Yahweh is the righteous one, and I and my people are the wicked ones. 
EXO.9.28	Pray to Yahweh. The thunder of God and hail are enough,
EXO.9.29	And Moses said to him, “At my leaving the city, I will spread out my hands to Yahweh. The thunder will stop, and the hail will be no more, so that you will know that the earth belongs to Yahweh. 
EXO.9.30	But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the presence of Yahweh God.” 
EXO.9.31	And the flax and the barley were struck, because the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud. 
EXO.9.32	But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, because they are late-ripening. 
EXO.9.33	And Moses went from Pharaoh out of the city, and he spread his hands to Yahweh, and the thunder and the hail stopped, and rain did not pour on the earth. 
EXO.9.34	And Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder stopped, and he again sinned
EXO.9.35	And Pharaoh’s heart was hard, and he did not release the Israelites,
EXO.10.1	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have made his heart insensitive
EXO.10.2	so that you will tell in the ears of your child and your grandchild
EXO.10.3	And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and they said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, ‘Until when will you refuse to submit before me? Release my people so that they may serve me. 
EXO.10.4	But if you are refusing to release my people, look, I am about to bring locusts into your territory tomorrow. 
EXO.10.5	And they will cover the surface of the land, and no one will be able to see the land, and they will eat the remainder of what is left—what is left over for you from the hail—and they will eat every sprouting tree belonging to you from the field. 
EXO.10.6	And your houses will be full, and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all Egypt, something that your fathers and your grandfathers
EXO.10.7	And the servants of Pharaoh said to him, “Until when will this be a snare for us? Release the men so that they may serve Yahweh their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?” 
EXO.10.8	And Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Serve Yahweh your God. Who are the ones going?
EXO.10.9	And Moses said, “With our young and with our old we will go; with our sons and with our daughters, with our sheep and goats and with our cattle we will go because it is the feast of Yahweh for us.” 
EXO.10.10	And he said to them, “Let Yahweh be thus with you as soon as I release you and your dependents.
EXO.10.11	No indeed;
EXO.10.12	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt with the locusts so that they may come up over the land of Egypt, and let them eat all the vegetation of the land, all that the hail left behind.” 
EXO.10.13	And Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and Yahweh drove an east wind into the land all that day and all night. The morning came, and the east wind had brought the locusts. 
EXO.10.14	And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and they settled in all the territory of Egypt, very severe.
EXO.10.15	And they covered the surface of all the land, and the land was dark with them, and they ate all the vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left, and no green was left in the trees nor in the vegetation of the field in all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.10.16	And Pharaoh hurried to call Moses and Aaron, and he said, “I have sinned against Yahweh your God and against you. 
EXO.10.17	And now forgive my sin surely this time, and pray to Yahweh your God so that he may only remove from me this death.” 
EXO.10.18	And he went out from Pharaoh, and he prayed to Yahweh. 
EXO.10.19	And Yahweh turned a very strong west wind
EXO.10.20	And Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not release the Israelites.
EXO.10.21	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the heavens so that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt and so that a person can feel darkness.” 
EXO.10.22	And Moses stretched out his hand toward the heavens, and there was darkness of night in all the land of Egypt for three days. 
EXO.10.23	No one could see his brother, and because of it no one could move from where they were
EXO.10.24	And Pharaoh called Moses and said, “Go, serve Yahweh. Only your sheep and goats and your cattle must be left behind. Your dependents
EXO.10.25	And Moses said, “Even if you yourself put into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings and we offer them to Yahweh our God, 
EXO.10.26	our livestock must also go with us. Not a hoof can be left because we must take from them to serve Yahweh our God. And we will not know with what we are to serve Yahweh until we come there.” 
EXO.10.27	And Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to release them. 
EXO.10.28	And Pharaoh said to him, “Go from me. Be careful
EXO.10.29	And Moses said, “That is right.
EXO.11.1	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Still one plague I will bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt; afterward he will release you from here. At the moment of his releasing, he will certainly drive you completely out from here. 
EXO.11.2	Speak in the ears of the people, and let them ask, a man from his neighbor and a woman from her neighbor, for objects of silver and objects of gold.” 
EXO.11.3	And Yahweh gave the people favor in the eyes of Egypt. Also the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of the servants of Pharaoh and in the eyes of the people. 
EXO.11.4	And Moses said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘About the middle of the night I will go out through the midst of Egypt, 
EXO.11.5	and every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the slave woman who is behind the pair of millstones and every firstborn animal.
EXO.11.6	And there will be a great cry of distress in all the land of Egypt, the like of which has not been nor will be again.
EXO.11.7	But against all the Israelites,
EXO.11.8	And all of these your servants will come down to me and bow to me, saying, ‘Go out, you and all the people who are at your feet.’ And afterward I will go out.” And he went out from Pharaoh in great anger.
EXO.11.9	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that my wonders may multiply
EXO.11.10	And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not release the Israelites
EXO.12.1	And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, 
EXO.12.2	“This month will be the beginning of months; it will be for you the first of the months of the year. 
EXO.12.3	Speak to all the community of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth of this month, they will each take for themselves a lamb for the family,
EXO.12.4	And if the household is too small for a lamb, he and the neighbor nearest to his house will take one according to the number of persons;
EXO.12.5	The lamb for you must be a male, without defect, in its first year; you will take it from the sheep or from the goats. 
EXO.12.6	“You will keep it
EXO.12.7	And they will take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel on the houses in which they eat it. 
EXO.12.8	And they will eat the meat on this night; they will eat it fire-roasted and with unleavened bread on bitter herbs.
EXO.12.9	You must not eat any of it raw or boiled, boiled in the water, but rather roasted with fire, its head with its legs and with its inner parts. 
EXO.12.10	And you must not leave any of it until morning; anything left from it until morning you must burn in the fire. 
EXO.12.11	And this is how you will eat it—with your waists fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand, and you will eat it in haste. It is Yahweh’s Passover. 
EXO.12.12	“And I will go through the land of Egypt during this night, and I will strike all of the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from human to animal, and I will do punishments among all of the gods of Egypt. I am Yahweh. 
EXO.12.13	And the blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and I will see the blood, and I will pass over you, and there will not be a destructive plague among you when I strike the land of Egypt. 
EXO.12.14	“And this day will become a memorial for you, and you will celebrate it as a religious feast for Yahweh throughout your generations; you will celebrate it as a lasting statute. 
EXO.12.15	You will eat unleavened bread for seven days. Surely on the first day you shall remove yeast from your houses, because anyone who eats food with yeast from the first day until the seventh day—that person will be cut off from Israel. 
EXO.12.16	It will be for you on the first day a holy assembly
EXO.12.17	“And you will keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because on this very day I brought out your divisions from the land of Egypt, and you will keep this day for your generations as a lasting statute. 
EXO.12.18	On the first day, on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, you will eat unleavened bread until the evening of the twenty-first day of the month. 
EXO.12.19	For seven days yeast must not be found in your houses, because anyone eating food with yeast
EXO.12.20	You will eat no food with yeast; in all of your dwellings you will eat unleavened bread.” 
EXO.12.21	And Moses called all the elders of Israel, and he said to them, “Select and take for yourselves sheep for your clans and slaughter the Passover sacrifice. 
EXO.12.22	And take a bunch of hyssop and dip it into the blood that is in the basin and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts. And you will not go out, anyone from the doorway of his house, until morning. 
EXO.12.23	And Yahweh will go through to strike Egypt, and he will see the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, and Yahweh will pass over the doorway and will not allow the destroyer to come to your houses to strike you. 
EXO.12.24	“And you will keep this event as a rule for you and for your children forever.
EXO.12.25	And
EXO.12.26	And
EXO.12.27	you will say, ‘It is a Passover sacrifice for Yahweh, who passed over the houses of the Israelites
EXO.12.28	And the Israelites
EXO.12.29	And
EXO.12.30	And Pharaoh got up at night, he and all his servants and all Egypt, and a great cry of distress was in Egypt because there was not a house where there was no one dead. 
EXO.12.31	And he called Moses and Aaron at night, and he said, “Get up, go out from the midst of my people, both you as well as the Israelites,
EXO.12.32	Take both your sheep and goats as well as your cattle, and go, and bless also me.” 
EXO.12.33	And the Egyptians urged the people in order to hurry their release
EXO.12.34	And the people lifted up their dough before it had yeast; their kneading troughs were wrapped up in their cloaks on their shoulder. 
EXO.12.35	And the Israelites
EXO.12.36	And Yahweh gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they granted their requests, and they plundered the Egyptians. 
EXO.12.37	And the Israelites
EXO.12.38	And also a mixed multitude
EXO.12.39	And they baked the dough that they had brought out from Egypt as cakes, unleavened bread, because it had no yeast when they were driven out from Egypt, and they were not able to delay, and also they had not made provisions for themselves. 
EXO.12.40	And the period of dwelling of the Israelites
EXO.12.41	And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, on this exact day, all of Yahweh’s divisions went out from the land of Egypt. 
EXO.12.42	It is a night of vigils
EXO.12.43	And Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover: No foreigner may eat it. 
EXO.12.44	But any slave of a man, an acquisition by money, and you have circumcised him, then he may eat it. 
EXO.12.45	A temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat it. 
EXO.12.46	It will be eaten in one house; you will not bring part of the meat out from the house to the outside; and you will not break a bone of it. 
EXO.12.47	All of the community of Israel will prepare it. 
EXO.12.48	And when an alien dwells with you and he wants to prepare the Passover for Yahweh, every male belonging to him must be circumcised, and then he may come near to prepare it, and he will be as the native of the land, but any uncircumcised man may not eat it. 
EXO.12.49	One law will be for the native and for the alien who is dwelling in your midst.” 
EXO.12.50	And all the Israelites
EXO.12.51	And it was on exactly this day Yahweh brought the Israelites
EXO.13.1	And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
EXO.13.2	“Consecrate to me every firstborn, the first offspring of every womb among the Israelites,
EXO.13.3	And Moses said to the people, “Remember this day when you went out from Egypt, from a house of slaves, because with strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from here, and food with yeast will not be eaten. 
EXO.13.4	Today you are going out in the month of Abib. 
EXO.13.5	And when Yahweh brings you to the land of the Canaanites
EXO.13.6	Seven days you will eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day will be a feast for Yahweh. 
EXO.13.7	Unleavened bread will be eaten the seven days; food with yeast will not be seen for you; and yeast will not be seen for you in all your territory. 
EXO.13.8	And you shall tell your son on that day, saying, ‘This is because of what Yahweh did for me when I came out from Egypt.’ 
EXO.13.9	And it will be as a sign on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes so that the law of Yahweh will be in your mouth, that with a strong hand Yahweh brought you out from Egypt. 
EXO.13.10	And you will keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.
EXO.13.11	“And when Yahweh brings you to the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your ancestors,
EXO.13.12	you will hand over every first offspring of a womb to Yahweh, and every first offspring dropped by a domestic animal that will belong to you, the males will be for Yahweh. 
EXO.13.13	And every first offspring of a donkey you will redeem with small livestock, and if you will not redeem it, then you will break its neck, and every firstborn human among your sons you will redeem. 
EXO.13.14	And when your son asks you in the future,
EXO.13.15	And when Pharaoh was stubborn to release us, Yahweh killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from firstborn human to firstborn domestic animal. Therefore I am sacrificing to Yahweh every first offspring of a womb, the males, and every firstborn of my sons I redeem.’ 
EXO.13.16	And it will be as a sign on your hand and as symbolic ornaments between your eyes that with strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt.” 
EXO.13.17	And when Pharaoh released the people, God did not lead them the way of the land of the Philistines, though it was nearer, because God said, “Lest the people change their mind when they see war and return to Egypt.” 
EXO.13.18	So God led the people around by the way of the desert to the Red Sea,
EXO.13.19	And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph
EXO.13.20	And they set out from Succoth, and they encamped at Etham on the edge of the desert. 
EXO.13.21	And Yahweh was going before them by day in a column of cloud to lead them on the way and by night in a column of fire to give light to them to go by day and night. 
EXO.13.22	The column of cloud by day and the column of fire by night did not depart from before the people. 
EXO.14.1	And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
EXO.14.2	“Speak to the Israelites
EXO.14.3	And Pharaoh will say of the Israelites,
EXO.14.4	And I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and he will chase after them, and I will be glorified through Pharaoh and through all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh.” And they did so. 
EXO.14.5	And it was told to the king of Egypt that the people fled, and the heart of Pharaoh was changed and that of his servants toward the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we have released Israel from serving us!” 
EXO.14.6	And he harnessed his chariot and took with him his people. 
EXO.14.7	And he took six hundred select chariots and all the chariots of Egypt and officers over all of them. 
EXO.14.8	And Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and he chased after the Israelites.
EXO.14.9	And the Egyptians chased after them, and they overtook them encamped at the sea—all the horses of the chariots of Pharaoh and his charioteers and his army—at Pi-hahiroth before Baal Zephon. 
EXO.14.10	And Pharaoh approached, and the Israelites
EXO.14.11	And they said to Moses, “Because there are no graves in Egypt? Is that why you have taken us to die in the desert? What is this you have done to us by bringing us out from Egypt! 
EXO.14.12	Isn’t this the word we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone so that we can serve Egypt!’ because serving Egypt is better for us than our dying in the desert.” 
EXO.14.13	And Moses said to the people, “You must not be afraid. Stand still and see the salvation of Yahweh, which he will accomplish for you today, because the Egyptians whom you see today you will see never again. 
EXO.14.14	Yahweh will fight for you, and you must be quiet.” 
EXO.14.15	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Why do you cry out to me? Speak to the Israelites
EXO.14.16	And you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it so that the Israelites
EXO.14.17	And as for me, look, I am about to harden the heart of the Egyptians so that they come after them, and I will display my glory through Pharaoh and through all of his army, through his chariots and through his charioteers. 
EXO.14.18	And the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I display my glory through Pharaoh, through his chariots, and through his charioteers.” 
EXO.14.19	And the angel of God who was going before the camp of Israel set out and went behind them. And the column of cloud set out ahead of them, and it stood still behind them, 
EXO.14.20	so that it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. And it was a dark cloud,
EXO.14.21	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh moved the sea
EXO.14.22	And the Israelites
EXO.14.23	And the Egyptians gave chase
EXO.14.24	And during the morning watch, Yahweh looked down to the Egyptian camp from in the column of fire and cloud, and he threw the Egyptian camp into a panic. 
EXO.14.25	And he removed
EXO.14.26	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, and let the waters return over the Egyptians, over their chariots, and over their charioteers.” 
EXO.14.27	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned at daybreak
EXO.14.28	And the waters returned and covered the chariots and the charioteers—all the army of Pharaoh coming after them into the sea. Not even
EXO.14.29	But the Israelites
EXO.14.30	And Yahweh saved Israel on that day from the hand
EXO.14.31	And Israel saw the great hand
EXO.15.1	Then Moses and the Israelites
EXO.15.1	“Let me sing to Yahweh because he is highly exalted; 
EXO.15.1	the horse and its rider he hurled into the sea. 
EXO.15.2	Yah
EXO.15.2	this is my God, and I will praise him—the God of my father—and I will exalt him. 
EXO.15.3	Yahweh is a man of war; Yahweh is his name. 
EXO.15.4	The chariots of Pharaoh and his army he cast into the sea, 
EXO.15.4	and his choice adjutants were sunk in the Red Sea.
EXO.15.5	The deep waters covered them; 
EXO.15.5	they went down into the depths like a stone. 
EXO.15.6	Yahweh, your right hand is glorious in power; 
EXO.15.6	Yahweh, your right hand destroyed the enemy. 
EXO.15.7	And in the greatness of your majesty you overthrew those standing up to you; 
EXO.15.7	you released your fierce anger, and it consumed them like stubble. 
EXO.15.8	And by the breath of your nostrils waters were piled up; 
EXO.15.8	waves stood like a heap; 
EXO.15.8	deep waters in the middle of the sea congealed. 
EXO.15.9	The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide plunder, 
EXO.15.9	my desire will be full of them, I will draw my sword, my hand will destroy them.’ 
EXO.15.10	You blew with your breath; the sea covered them; 
EXO.15.10	they dropped like lead in the mighty waters. 
EXO.15.11	Who is like you among the gods, Yahweh? 
EXO.15.11	Who is like you—glorious in holiness, awesome in praiseworthy actions, doing wonders?
EXO.15.12	You stretched out your right hand; 
EXO.15.12	the earth swallowed them. 
EXO.15.13	In your loyal love you led the people whom you redeemed; 
EXO.15.13	in your strength you guided them to the abode of your holiness.
EXO.15.14	Peoples heard; they trembled; 
EXO.15.14	anguish seized the inhabitants of Philistia. 
EXO.15.15	Then the chiefs of Edom were horrified; great distress seized the leaders of Moab; 
EXO.15.15	all of the inhabitants of Canaan melted away. 
EXO.15.16	Terror and dread fell on them; 
EXO.15.16	at the greatness of your arm they became silent like the stone, 
EXO.15.16	until your people passed by, Yahweh, 
EXO.15.16	until the people whom you bought passed by. 
EXO.15.17	You brought them and planted them on the mountain of your inheritance, 
EXO.15.17	a place you made for yourself to inhabit, Yahweh, 
EXO.15.17	a sanctuary, Lord, that your hands established. 
EXO.15.18	Yahweh will reign as king forever and ever.” 
EXO.15.19	When the horses
EXO.15.20	And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took her
EXO.15.21	And Miriam answered,
EXO.15.22	And Moses caused Israel to set out from the Red Sea,
EXO.15.23	And they came to Marah, and they were not able to drink water from Marah because it was bitter. Therefore it was named
EXO.15.24	And the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?” 
EXO.15.25	And he cried out to Yahweh, and Yahweh showed him a piece of wood, and he threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. There he made a rule and regulation for them, and there he tested them. 
EXO.15.26	And he said, “If you carefully listen to the voice of Yahweh your God and you do what is right in his eyes and give heed to his commands and you keep all his rules, then I will not bring about on you any of the diseases
EXO.15.27	And they came to Elim, and twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees were there, and they encamped there at the water. 
EXO.16.1	And they set out from Elim, and all the community of the Israelites
EXO.16.2	And all the community of the Israelites
EXO.16.3	And the Israelites
EXO.16.4	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Look, I am going to rain down for you bread from the heavens, and the people will go out and gather enough for the day on its day; in that way I will test them: Will they go according to my law or not? 
EXO.16.5	And then on the sixth day, they will prepare what they bring, and it will be twice over what they will gather every other day.” 
EXO.16.6	And Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites,
EXO.16.7	and in the morning, you will see the glory of Yahweh, for he hears
EXO.16.8	And Moses said, “When in the evening Yahweh gives you meat to eat and bread in the morning to fill up on,
EXO.16.9	And Moses said to Aaron, “Say to all the community of the Israelites,
EXO.16.10	And at the moment of Aaron’s speaking to all the community of the Israelites,
EXO.16.11	And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
EXO.16.12	“I have heard the grumblings of the Israelites.
EXO.16.13	And so it was, in the evening, the quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning, a layer of dew was all around the camp. 
EXO.16.14	And the layer of dew came up, and there
EXO.16.15	And the Israelites
EXO.16.16	This is the word that Yahweh commanded, ‘Gather from it, each according to what he can eat,
EXO.16.17	And the Israelites
EXO.16.18	And when they measured with the omer, the one gathering more had no surplus, and the one gathering less had no lack; they gathered each according to what he could eat.
EXO.16.19	And Moses said to them, “Let no one leave any of it until morning.” 
EXO.16.20	But they did not listen to Moses. Some people
EXO.16.21	And they gathered it morning by morning, each according to what he could eat,
EXO.16.22	And when it was the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one person, and all the leaders of the community came and told Moses. 
EXO.16.23	And he said to them, “This is what Yahweh has said. Tomorrow is a rest period, a holy Sabbath for Yahweh. Bake what you want to bake, and boil what you want to boil. Put aside all the surplus for yourselves for safekeeping until the morning.” 
EXO.16.24	And they put it aside until the morning, as Moses had commanded, and it did not make a stench, and not a maggot was in it. 
EXO.16.25	And Moses said, “Eat it today, because today is a Sabbath for Yahweh. Today you will not find it in the field. 
EXO.16.26	Six days you will gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, it will not be present on it.” 
EXO.16.27	And on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, and they did not find any. 
EXO.16.28	And Yahweh said to Moses, “How long do you
EXO.16.29	See, because Yahweh has given to you the Sabbath, therefore he is giving to you on the sixth day bread for two days. Stay, each in his location;
EXO.16.30	And the people rested on the seventh day. 
EXO.16.31	And the house of Israel called its name “manna.” And it was like coriander seed, white, and its taste was like a wafer with honey. 
EXO.16.32	And Moses said, “This is the word that Yahweh has commanded. ‘A full omer of it is for safekeeping for your generations so that they will see the bread that I fed you in the desert when I brought you from the land of Egypt.’ ” 
EXO.16.33	And Moses said to Aaron, “Take one jar and put there a full omer of manna. Leave it before Yahweh for safekeeping for your generations.” 
EXO.16.34	As Yahweh had commanded Moses, so Aaron left it before the testimony for safekeeping. 
EXO.16.35	And the Israelites
EXO.16.36	(And an omer is a tenth of an ephah.) 
EXO.17.1	And all the community of the Israelites
EXO.17.2	And the people quarreled with Moses, and they said, “Give us water so that we can drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?” 
EXO.17.3	And the people thirsted for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, “Why ever
EXO.17.4	And Moses cried out to Yahweh, saying, “What will I do with this people? A little longer and they will stone me.” 
EXO.17.5	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go on before the people and take with you some from the elders of Israel, and the staff with which you struck the Nile take in your hand, and go. 
EXO.17.6	Look, I will be standing before you there on the rock in Horeb, and you will strike the rock, and water will come out from it, and the people will drink.” 
EXO.17.6	And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel. 
EXO.17.7	And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarrel of the Israelites
EXO.17.8	And Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim. 
EXO.17.9	And Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men for us, and go out, fight against Amalek tomorrow. I will be standing on the top of the hill, and the staff of God will be in my hand.” 
EXO.17.10	And Joshua did as Moses had said to him to fight with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
EXO.17.11	And
EXO.17.12	But the hands of Moses were heavy, and they took a stone and placed it under him, and he sat on it; Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on each side,
EXO.17.13	And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
EXO.17.14	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Write this as a memorial in the scroll and recite it in the hearing of
EXO.17.15	And Moses built an altar, and he called its name Yahweh Is My Banner. 
EXO.17.16	And he said, “Because a hand was against the throne of Yah,
EXO.18.1	And Jethro, the priest of Midian, the father-in-law of Moses, heard all that God had done for Moses and for Israel, his people, that Yahweh had brought Israel out from Egypt. 
EXO.18.2	And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, took Zipporah the wife of Moses after her sending away, 
EXO.18.3	and her two sons—the one whose name was Gershom, for he had said, “I have been an alien in a foreign land,” 
EXO.18.4	and the one whose name was Eliezer, for “the God of my father was my help, and he delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.” 
EXO.18.5	And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, came and his sons and his wife to Moses, to the desert where he was camping there at the mountain of God. 
EXO.18.6	And he said to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you and your wife and her two sons with her.” 
EXO.18.7	And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed, and he kissed him, and they each asked about the other’s welfare,
EXO.18.8	And Moses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to Egypt on account of Israel, all the hardship that had found them on the way, and how Yahweh delivered them. 
EXO.18.9	And Jethro rejoiced over all the good that Yahweh had done for Israel when he delivered them from the hand of Egypt. 
EXO.18.10	And Jethro said, “Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of Pharaoh—who has delivered the people from under the hand of Egypt. 
EXO.18.11	Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all the gods, even in the matter where they the Egyptians dealt arrogantly against the Israelites.”
EXO.18.12	And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat bread with the father-in-law of Moses before God. 
EXO.18.13	And
EXO.18.14	And the father-in-law of Moses saw all that he was doing for the people, and he said, “What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why are you sitting alone and all the people are standing by you from morning until evening?” 
EXO.18.15	And Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to seek God. 
EXO.18.16	When they have an issue,
EXO.18.17	And the father-in-law of Moses said to him, “The thing that you are doing is not good. 
EXO.18.18	Surely you will wear out, both you and this people who are with you, because the thing is too difficult
EXO.18.19	Now listen to my voice; I will advise you, and may God be with you. You be for the people before God, and you bring the issues to God. 
EXO.18.20	And you warn them of the rules and the instructions, and you make known to them the way in which they must walk and the work that they must do. 
EXO.18.21	And you will select from all the people men of ability, fearers of God, trustworthy men, haters of dishonest gain,
EXO.18.22	And let them judge the people all the time, and
EXO.18.23	If you will do this thing and God will command you, then you will be able to endure, and also each of the people will go to his home
EXO.18.24	And Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and he did all that he had said. 
EXO.18.25	And Moses chose men of ability from all Israel, and he appointed them as heads over the people, as commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, and commanders of tens. 
EXO.18.26	And they judged the people all the time; the difficult issues
EXO.18.27	And Moses let his father-in-law go, and he went to his land. 
EXO.19.1	In the third month after the Israelites
EXO.19.2	They set out from Rephidim, and they came to the desert of Sinai, and they camped in the desert, and Israel camped there in front of the mountain. 
EXO.19.3	And Moses went up to God, and Yahweh called to him from the mountain, saying, “Thus you will say to the house of Jacob and you will tell the Israelites,
EXO.19.4	‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and I brought you to me. 
EXO.19.5	And now if you will carefully listen to my voice and keep my covenant, you will be a treasured possession for me out of all the peoples, for all the earth is mine,
EXO.19.6	but you, you will belong to me as a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you will speak to the Israelites.”
EXO.19.7	And Moses came and called the elders of the people, and he placed before them all these words that Yahweh had commanded him. 
EXO.19.8	And all the people together answered and said, “All that Yahweh has spoken we will do.” And Moses brought back the words of the people to Yahweh. 
EXO.19.9	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Look, I am going to come to you in a thick cloud
EXO.19.10	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. They must wash their clothes, 
EXO.19.11	and they must be prepared for the third day, because on the third day, Yahweh will go down on Mount Sinai before the eyes of all the people. 
EXO.19.12	And you must set limits for the people all around, saying, ‘Guard yourselves against
EXO.19.13	Not a hand will touch it, because he will certainly be stoned or certainly be shot; whether an animal or a man, he will not live.’ At the blowing of the ram’s horn they may go up to the mountain.” 
EXO.19.14	And Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and he consecrated the people, and they washed their clothes. 
EXO.19.15	And he said to the people, “Be ready for the third day.
EXO.19.16	And
EXO.19.17	And Moses brought the people out from the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. 
EXO.19.18	And Mount Sinai was all wrapped in smoke because Yahweh went down on it in the fire, and its smoke went up like the smoke of a smelting furnace, and the whole mountain trembled greatly. 
EXO.19.19	And the sound of the ram’s horn became louder and louder,
EXO.19.20	And Yahweh went down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain, and Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. 
EXO.19.21	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to see and many from them fall. 
EXO.19.22	And even the priests who come near Yahweh must consecrate themselves, lest Yahweh break out against them.” 
EXO.19.23	And Moses said to Yahweh, “The people are not able to go up to Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, saying, ‘Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it.’ ” 
EXO.19.24	And Yahweh said to him, “Go, go down, and come up, you and Aaron with you and the priests, but the people must not break through to go up to Yahweh, lest he break out against them.” 
EXO.19.25	And Moses went down to the people, and he told them.
EXO.20.1	And God spoke all these words, saying, 
EXO.20.2	“I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt, from the house of slaves. 
EXO.20.3	“There shall be for you no other gods before me. 
EXO.20.4	“You shall not make for yourself a divine image with any form that is in the heavens above or that is in the earth below or that is in the water below the earth. 
EXO.20.5	You will not bow down to them, and you will not serve them, because I am Yahweh your God, a jealous God, punishing the guilt of the parents on the children on the third and on the fourth generations
EXO.20.6	and showing loyal love to thousands of generations
EXO.20.7	“You shall not misuse the name of Yahweh your God,
EXO.20.8	“Remember the day of the Sabbath, to consecrate it. 
EXO.20.9	Six days you will work, and you will do all your work. 
EXO.20.10	But the seventh day is a Sabbath for Yahweh your God; you will not do any work—you or your son or your daughter, your male slave or your female slave, or your animal, or your alien who is in your gates—
EXO.20.11	because in six days Yahweh made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and on the seventh day he rested. Therefore Yahweh blessed the seventh day and consecrated it. 
EXO.20.12	“Honor your father and your mother, so that your days can be long on the land that Yahweh your God is giving you. 
EXO.20.13	“You shall not murder.

EXO.20.18	And all the people were seeing the thunder and the lightning and the sound of the ram’s horn and the mountain smoking, and the people saw, and they trembled, and they stood at a distance. 
EXO.20.19	And they said to Moses, “You speak with us, and we will listen, but let not God speak with us, lest we die.” 
EXO.20.20	And Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. God has come to test you so that his fear will be before you so that you do not sin.” 
EXO.20.21	And the people stood at a distance, and Moses approached the very thick cloud where God was. 
EXO.20.22	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Thus you will say to the Israelites,
EXO.20.23	You will not make alongside me gods of silver, and gods of gold you will not make for yourselves. 
EXO.20.24	An altar of earth you will make for me, and you will sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your fellowship offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I cause my name to be remembered,
EXO.20.25	And if you make an altar of stones for me, you will not build them as hewn stone, because if you use your chisel on it, you have defiled it. 
EXO.20.26	You will not go up with steps onto my altar, that your nakedness not be exposed on it.’ 
EXO.21.1	“And these are the regulations that you will set before them. 
EXO.21.2	‘If you buy a Hebrew slave, he will serve six years, and in the seventh he will go out as free for nothing.
EXO.21.3	If he comes in single, he will go out single. If he is the husband of a wife, his wife will go out with him. 
EXO.21.4	If his master gives him a wife and she bears for him sons or daughters, the wife and her children will belong to her master, and the slave will go out single. 
EXO.21.5	But if the slave explicitly says, “I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,” 
EXO.21.6	his master will present him to God
EXO.21.7	“ ‘And if a man sells his daughter as a slave woman, she will not go out as male slaves go out. 
EXO.21.8	If she does not please her master
EXO.21.9	And if he selects her for his son, he shall do for her according to the regulations for daughters. 
EXO.21.10	If he takes for himself another, he will not reduce her food, her clothing, or her right of cohabitation. 
EXO.21.11	And if he does not do for her these three, she shall go out for nothing; there will not be silver

EXO.21.20	And if a man strikes his male slave or his female slave with the rod and he dies under his hand, he will surely be avenged. 
EXO.21.21	Yet if he survives a day or two days, he will not be avenged, because he is his money.
EXO.21.22	“ ‘And if men fight and they injure a pregnant woman, and her children go out and there is not serious injury, he will surely be fined as the woman’s husband demands concerning him and as the judges determine.
EXO.21.23	And if there is serious injury, you will give life in place of life,

EXO.21.34	the owner of the pit will pay restitution; he will pay silver to its owner, but the dead animal will be for him.

EXO.22.9	Concerning every account of transgression—concerning an ox, concerning a donkey, concerning small livestock, concerning clothing, concerning all lost property—where someone says, “This belongs to me,” the matter of the two of them will come to God;

EXO.30.2	a cubit its length and a cubit its width—it will be square—and two cubits its height, its horns of one piece with it.
EXO.30.3	And you will overlay it with pure gold, its top and its sides all around and its horns, and you will make for it a gold molding all around. 
EXO.30.4	And you will make two gold rings for it; under its molding on two opposite sides

EXO.30.8	And when Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight,
EXO.30.9	You will not offer on it strange incense or a burnt offering or a grain offering, and you will not pour a libation on it. 
EXO.30.10	And Aaron will make atonement on its horns one time in the year from the blood of the sin offering of the atonement; one time in the year he will make atonement on it throughout your generations; it is a most holy thing for Yahweh.” 
EXO.30.11	And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
EXO.30.12	“When you take a census of
EXO.30.13	This they will give, everyone who is counted,
EXO.30.14	Everyone who is counted
EXO.30.15	The rich will not give more, and the poor will not give less than the half shekel to give the contribution of Yahweh to make atonement for their lives. 
EXO.30.16	And you will take the atonement money from the Israelites
EXO.30.17	And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
EXO.30.18	“And you will make a basin of bronze and its bronze stand for washing, and you will put it between the tent of assembly and the altar, and you will put water there. 
EXO.30.19	And Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and their feet with it. 
EXO.30.20	When they come to the tent of assembly, they will wash with water so that they do not die, or when they approach the altar to serve by turning to smoke an offering made by fire to Yahweh. 
EXO.30.21	And they will wash their hands and their feet so that they do not die, and it will be a lasting rule for them—to him and to his offspring throughout their generations. 
EXO.30.22	And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
EXO.30.23	“And take for yourself top quality balsam oils, five hundred shekels of flowing myrrh, half as much—two hundred and fifty shekels of fragrant cinnamon, and two hundred and fifty shekels of fragrant reed, 
EXO.30.24	and five hundred shekels of cassia, according to the sanctuary shekel, and a hin of olive oil. 
EXO.30.25	And you will make it into holy anointing oil, a spice blend of a fragrant ointment the work of a perfumer; it will be holy anointing oil. 
EXO.30.26	And you will anoint with it the tent of assembly and the ark of the testimony, 
EXO.30.27	and the table and all its equipment and the lampstand and its equipment and the incense altar, 
EXO.30.28	and the altar of burnt offering and all its equipment and the basin and its stand. 
EXO.30.29	And you will consecrate them, and they will be most holy things; anyone who

EXO.30.31	“And you will speak to the Israelites,
EXO.30.32	It will not be poured on human flesh, and with its measurements
EXO.30.33	Anyone who compounds perfume like it and who puts it on a stranger will be cut off from his people.’ ” 
EXO.30.34	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Take for yourself fragrant perfumes—stacte resin and onycha and galbanum—fragrant perfumes and pure frankincense, an equal part of each,
EXO.30.35	and make it into a compound of incense, the work of a perfumer, salted, pure, holy. 
EXO.30.36	And you will grind part of it to powder, and you will put part of it before the testimony in the tent of assembly where I will meet with you; it will be a most holy thing to you. 
EXO.30.37	And the incense that you will make with its measurements
EXO.30.38	Anyone who makes any like it to smell it will be cut off from his people.” 
EXO.31.1	And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
EXO.31.2	“See, I have called by name
EXO.31.3	And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom and with skill
EXO.31.4	to devise designs, to work with gold and with silver and with bronze, 
EXO.31.5	and in stonecutting for setting and in cutting wood, for doing every kind of craftsmanship. 
EXO.31.6	And, look, I have given with him Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, and I have put skill in the heart of all the skilled of heart, and they will make all that I have commanded you— 
EXO.31.7	the tent of assembly and the ark of the testimony and the atonement cover that is on it and all the equipment of the tent, 
EXO.31.8	and the table and all its equipment, and the pure gold lampstand and all its equipment, and the incense altar, 
EXO.31.9	and the altar of burnt offering and all its equipment, and the basin and its stand, 
EXO.31.10	and the garments of woven material, and the garments of the sanctuary
EXO.31.11	and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense for the sanctuary. According to all that I have commanded you, they will make it. 
EXO.31.12	And Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 
EXO.31.13	“And you, speak to the Israelites,
EXO.31.14	And you must keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you; defilers
EXO.31.15	On six days work can be done, and on the seventh is a Sabbath of complete rest,
EXO.31.16	The Israelites
EXO.31.17	It is a sign between me and the Israelites
EXO.31.18	And when he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, he gave to Moses the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets, written with the finger of God. 
EXO.32.1	And the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, and the people gathered opposite Aaron, and they said to him, “Come,
EXO.32.2	And Aaron said to them, “Take off the rings of gold that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring it to me.” 
EXO.32.3	And all the people took off the rings of gold that were on their ears and brought it to Aaron. 
EXO.32.4	And he took from their hand, and he shaped it with a tool, and he made it a cast-image bull calf, and they said, “These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.” 
EXO.32.5	And Aaron saw, and he built an altar before it, and Aaron called, and he said, “A feast for Yahweh tomorrow.” 
EXO.32.6	And they started early the next day, and they offered burnt offerings, and they presented fellowship offerings, and the people sat to eat and drink, and they rose up to revel. 
EXO.32.7	And Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Go, go down because your people behave corruptly, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt. 
EXO.32.8	They have turned aside quickly from the way that I commanded them; they have made for themselves a cast-image bull calf, and they bowed to it, and they sacrificed to it, and they said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.’ ” 
EXO.32.9	And Yahweh said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and, indeed, they are a stiff-necked people. 
EXO.32.10	And now leave me alone so that my anger may blaze
EXO.32.11	And Moses implored Yahweh
EXO.32.12	Why should the Egyptians say
EXO.32.13	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by yourself, and you told them, ‘I will multiply your offspring like the stars of the heavens, and all this land that I promised I will give to your offspring, and they will inherit it forever.’ ” 
EXO.32.14	And Yahweh relented concerning the disaster that he had threatened
EXO.32.15	And Moses turned and went down from the mountain, and the two tablets of the testimony were in his hand, tablets written on their two sides; on the front and on the back
EXO.32.16	And the tablets, they were the work of God; and the writing, it was the writing of God engraved on the tablets. 
EXO.32.17	And Joshua heard the sound of the people in their shouting, and he said to Moses, “A sound of war is in the camp.” 
EXO.32.18	But he said, “There is not a sound of shouting of victory, and there is not a sound of shouting of defeat. I hear a sound of singing.” 
EXO.32.19	And
EXO.32.20	And he took the bull calf that they had made, and he burned it with the fire, and he crushed it until it became fine, and he scattered it on the surface of the water, and he made the Israelites
EXO.32.21	And Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you that you brought on them such a great sin?” 
EXO.32.22	And Aaron said, “Let not my lord become angry.
EXO.32.23	And they said to me, ‘Make for us gods who will go before us, because this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’ 
EXO.32.24	And I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, take it off.’ And they gave it to me, and I threw it in the fire, and out came this bull calf.” 
EXO.32.25	And Moses saw the people, that they were running wild
EXO.32.26	And Moses stood at the entrance of the camp, and he said, “Whoever is for Yahweh, to me.” And all the sons of Levi were gathered to him. 
EXO.32.27	And he said to them, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘Put each his sword on his side. Go back and forth
EXO.32.28	And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses, and from the people on that day about three thousand persons fell.
EXO.32.29	And Moses said, “You are ordained
EXO.32.30	And
EXO.32.31	And Moses returned to Yahweh, and he said, “Alas, this people has sinned a great sin and made for themselves gods of gold. 
EXO.32.32	And now if you will forgive their sin—and if not, please blot me from your scroll that you have written.” 
EXO.32.33	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot him from my scroll. 
EXO.32.34	And now go, lead the people to where I spoke to you. Look, my angel will go before you, and on the day when I punish I will punish them for their sin.” 
EXO.32.35	And Yahweh afflicted the people because they had made the bull calf that Aaron had made. 
EXO.33.1	And Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Go, go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up from the land of Egypt, to the land that I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’ 
EXO.33.2	And I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites,
EXO.33.3	Go to a land flowing with milk and honey, but I will not go up among you, because you are a stiff-necked people, lest I destroy you on the way.” 
EXO.33.4	And the people heard this troubling
EXO.33.5	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites,
EXO.33.6	And the Israelites
EXO.33.7	And Moses took the tent and pitched it outside the camp far from the camp, and he called it the tent of assembly, and
EXO.33.8	And
EXO.33.9	And
EXO.33.10	And all the people would see the column of cloud standing at the opening of the tent, and all the people would rise and bow in worship, each at the opening of his tent. 
EXO.33.11	And Yahweh would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his neighbor. And he would return to the camp, and his assistant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not leave the middle of the tent. 
EXO.33.12	And Moses said to Yahweh, “See, you are saying to me, ‘Take this people up.’ But you have not let me know whom you will send with me, and you yourself have said, ‘I know you by name, and you also have found favor in my eyes.’ 
EXO.33.13	And now if I have found favor in your eyes, make known to me, please, your way, and so I may know you so that I can find favor in your eyes. And see that this nation is your people.” 
EXO.33.14	And he said, “My presence will go, and I will give you rest.” 
EXO.33.15	And he said to him, “If your presence is not going, do not bring us up from here. 
EXO.33.16	And by what will it be known then that I have found favor in your eyes, I and your people? Is it not by your going with us? And so we will be distinguished, I and your people, from all the people who are on the face of the ground.” 
EXO.33.17	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Also I will do this thing that you have spoken, because you have found favor in my eyes and I have known you by name.” 
EXO.33.18	And he said, “Please show me your glory.” 
EXO.33.19	And he said, “I myself will cause all my goodness to pass over before you, and I will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you, and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will show compassion to whom I will show compassion.” 
EXO.33.20	But he said, “You are not able to see my face, because a human will not see me and live.” 
EXO.33.21	And Yahweh said, “There is a place with me, and you will stand on the rock. 
EXO.33.22	And
EXO.33.23	And I will remove my hand, and you will see my back, but my face will not be visible.” 
EXO.34.1	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Cut for yourself two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. 
EXO.34.2	And be ready for the morning, and go up in the morning to Mount Sinai and present yourself to me there on the top of the mountain. 
EXO.34.3	And no one will go up with you, and neither let anyone be seen on all the mountain, nor let the sheep and goats and the cattle graze opposite
EXO.34.4	And Moses cut two stone tablets like the first ones, and he started early in the morning, and he went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him, and he took in his hand the two stone tablets. 
EXO.34.5	And Yahweh descended in the cloud, and he stood with him there, and he proclaimed the name of Yahweh. 
EXO.34.6	And Yahweh passed over before him, and he proclaimed, “Yahweh, Yahweh, God, who is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger,
EXO.34.7	keeping loyal love to the thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and he does not leave utterly unpunished, punishing the guilt of fathers on sons and on sons of sons on third and fourth generations.” 
EXO.34.8	And Moses hurried and knelt down to the earth and worshiped. 
EXO.34.9	And he said, “Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, Lord, let my Lord, please, go among us—indeed it is a stiff-necked people—and forgive our iniquity and our sin and take us as your possession.”
EXO.34.10	And he said, “Look, I am about to make a covenant. In front of all your people I will do wonders that have not been created on all the earth and among all the nations, and all the people among whom you are will see Yahweh’s work, because what I am about to do with you will be awesome. 
EXO.34.11	“Keep for yourself what I myself have commanded you today. Look, I am about to drive from before you the Amorites and the Canaanites
EXO.34.12	Be careful for yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, lest it be a snare among you. 
EXO.34.13	Rather, you will tear down their altars, and you will break their stone pillars, and you will cut off their Asherah poles. 
EXO.34.14	For you will not bow in worship to another god, for ‘Yahweh Is Jealous’ is his name, he is a jealous God, 
EXO.34.15	lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they prostitute themselves after their gods, and they sacrifice to their gods, and they invite you, and you eat their sacrifice, 
EXO.34.16	and you take from their daughters for your sons, and their daughters prostitute themselves after their gods, and they cause your sons to prostitute themselves after their gods. 
EXO.34.17	You will not make gods of cast metal for yourself. 
EXO.34.18	“You will keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Seven days you will eat unleavened bread, which I commanded you, at the appointed time of the month of Abib, for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt. 
EXO.34.19	Every first offspring of a womb is for me—all of your male livestock, the first offspring of cattle and small livestock. 
EXO.34.20	But the first offspring of a donkey you will redeem with small livestock, and if you will not redeem it, you will break its neck. Every firstborn of your sons you will redeem, and you will not appear before me empty-handed. 
EXO.34.21	Six days you will work, and on the seventh day you will rest; in the time of plowing and in the time of harvest you will rest.

NUM.7.89	And when Moses came to the tent of assembly to speak with him,
NUM.8.1	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.8.2	“Speak to Aaron, and say to him: ‘When you are setting up the lamps, the seven lamps will give light in front of the face of the lampstand.’ ” 
NUM.8.3	And Aaron did so; he set up the lampstand in front of the face of its lamps, just as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
NUM.8.4	And this is how the lampstand was made,
NUM.8.5	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.8.6	“Take the Levites from the midst of the Israelites
NUM.8.7	So you will do to them, to purify them: sprinkle on them waters of purification, and they will shave their whole body
NUM.8.8	And they will take a young bull
NUM.8.9	You will bring the Levites before
NUM.8.10	And you will bring the Levites before Yahweh,
NUM.8.11	and Aaron will offer
NUM.8.12	And the Levites will lay their hands on the head of the one bull and offer it as a sin offering and the other one as a burnt offering to Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites. 
NUM.8.13	And you will present the Levites before
NUM.8.14	“And you will separate the Levites from the midst of the Israelites,
NUM.8.15	And after this the Levites will come to serve at the tent of assembly, and you will purify them, and you will offer
NUM.8.16	For they are given to me exclusively from the midst of the Israelites.
NUM.8.17	For every firstborn among the Israelites
NUM.8.18	and I have taken the Levites in the place of every firstborn among the Israelites.
NUM.8.19	And I have given the Levites; they are given to Aaron and his sons from the midst of the Israelites
NUM.8.20	And Moses and Aaron and the entire community of the Israelites
NUM.8.21	And the Levites purified themselves, and they washed their garments, and Aaron offered them
NUM.8.22	After this the Levites came to do their work in the tent of assembly before Aaron and his sons. Just as Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levities, so they did to them. 
NUM.8.23	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.8.24	“This is what is for the Levites: those twenty-five years old
NUM.8.25	and those fifty years old
NUM.8.26	They
NUM.9.1	Yahweh spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, in the second year after they came out from the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying, 
NUM.9.2	“Let the Israelites
NUM.9.3	On the fourteenth day of this month at twilight
NUM.9.4	So Moses spoke to the Israelites
NUM.9.5	And they observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight
NUM.9.6	And it happened, men who were unclean by a dead person
NUM.9.7	And those men said to him, “Although we are unclean by a dead person,
NUM.9.8	Moses said to them, “Stay. I will hear what Yahweh commands to you.” 
NUM.9.9	And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.9.10	“Speak to the Israelites,
NUM.9.11	On the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight
NUM.9.12	They will leave none of it until morning, and they will not break a bone in it; they will observe it according to every decree of the Passover. 
NUM.9.13	But the man who is clean and not on a journey, and he fails to observe the Passover, that person will be cut off from the people because he did not present the offering of Yahweh on its appointed time. That man will bear his guilt. 
NUM.9.14	If an alien dwells with you he will observe the Passover of Yahweh according to the decree of the Passover and according to its stipulation; thus you will have one decree for you, for the alien and for the native of the land.’ ” 
NUM.9.15	And on a day setting up the tabernacle, the cloud covered the tent of the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony; in the evening it was on the tabernacle as an appearance of fire until morning. 
NUM.9.16	So it was
NUM.9.17	Whenever the cloud lifted up from on the tent, after that the Israelites
NUM.9.18	On the command of Yahweh
NUM.9.19	And when the cloud prolonged on the tabernacle many days the Israelites
NUM.9.20	When the cloud remained
NUM.9.21	When the cloud remained
NUM.9.22	When it was two days, a month, or a year
NUM.9.23	On the command of Yahweh
NUM.10.1	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.10.2	“Make yourself two silver trumpets; make them of hammered-work. You will use them
NUM.10.3	You will blow them, and all the community will assemble to the doorway of the tent of assembly. 
NUM.10.4	But if they blow only one, the leaders, the heads of the thousands of Israel, will assemble to you. 
NUM.10.5	When you will blow a blast, the camps that are camping on the east will set out; 
NUM.10.6	when you blow a second blast, the camps that are camping on the south will set out; they will blow a blast for their journeys. 
NUM.10.7	But when summoning the assembly, you will blow, but you will not signal with a loud noise. 
NUM.10.8	The sons of Aaron, the priests, will blow on the trumpets; this will be an eternal decree for your generations. 
NUM.10.9	If you go to war in your land against the enemy who attacks you, you will signal with a loud noise on the trumpets. You will be remembered before
NUM.10.10	“And on the day of your joy and in your appointed times, at the beginning of your months, you will blow on the trumpets in addition to your burnt offerings and in addition to the sacrifices of your fellowship offerings. And they will be as a memorial for you before
NUM.10.11	And it happened, in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth of the month the cloud was lifted from upon the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.10.12	And the Israelites
NUM.10.13	They set out for the first time
NUM.10.14	The standard of the camp of the descendants
NUM.10.15	And Nathanel son of Zuar was over the division of the descendants
NUM.10.16	Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of the descendants
NUM.10.17	The tabernacle was taken down, and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, the bearers of the tabernacle, set out. 
NUM.10.18	And the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their divisions; Elizur son of Shedeur was over their division. 
NUM.10.19	Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the sons of the tribe of Simeon. 
NUM.10.20	Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of the descendants
NUM.10.21	The Kohathites, the bearers of the sanctuary, set out, and they set up the tabernacle before they arrived. 
NUM.10.22	And the stand of the camp of the descendants
NUM.10.23	Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of the descendants
NUM.10.24	Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of the descendants
NUM.10.25	Then the standard of the camp of the descendants
NUM.10.26	Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of the descendants
NUM.10.27	Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of the descendants
NUM.10.28	These were the departures of the Israelites
NUM.10.29	Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses, “We are setting out to the place that Yahweh said, ‘I will give it to you’; go with us, and we will treat you well
NUM.10.30	But he said to him, “I will not go. I will only go to my land and to my family.” 
NUM.10.31	He
NUM.10.32	Moreover, if you go with us, the good that Yahweh will do to us we will do to you.” 
NUM.10.33	And so they set out from the mountain of Yahweh a journey of three days, with the ark of the covenant of Yahweh setting out ahead of them
NUM.10.34	and the cloud of Yahweh was over them by day when they set out from the camp. 
NUM.10.35	And whenever the ark was setting out Moses would say, 
NUM.10.35	“Rise up, Yahweh! 
NUM.10.35	May your enemies be scattered; 
NUM.10.35	may the ones that hate you flee from your presence.” 
NUM.10.36	And when it rested he would say, 
NUM.10.36	“Return, Yahweh, 
NUM.10.36	to the countless thousands of Israel.” 
NUM.11.1	And it happened, the people were like those who complain of hardship
NUM.11.2	Then the people cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire died down. 
NUM.11.3	And he called the name of that place Taberah
NUM.11.4	The riff-raff that were in their midst had a strong desire;
NUM.11.5	We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumber, melon, leek, the onions, and the garlic. 
NUM.11.6	But now our strength is dried up;
NUM.11.7	Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its outward appearance was like that of bdellium-gum. 
NUM.11.8	The people went about and gathered it, and they ground it with mills or crushed it with mortar. Then they boiled it in a pot and made it into bread-cakes; and it tasted like olive oil cakes. 
NUM.11.9	When the dew came down on the camp at night, the manna came down with it. 
NUM.11.10	Moses heard the people weeping according to their
NUM.11.11	And Moses said to Yahweh, “Why have you brought trouble to your servant? Why have I not found favor in your eyes, that the burdens of all these people have been placed on me? 
NUM.11.12	Did I conceive all these people? If I have fathered them,
NUM.11.13	From where do I have meat to give all these people? They weep before me, saying, ‘Give us meat and let us eat!’ 
NUM.11.14	I am not able to carry all these people along alone; they are too heavy for me. 
NUM.11.15	If this is how you are going to treat me, please kill me immediately if I find favor in your eyes, and do not let me see my misery.” 
NUM.11.16	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather for me seventy men from the elders of Israel whom you know are elders of the people and their
NUM.11.17	I will come down and speak with you there; I will take away from the spirit that is on you, and I will place it on them; and they will bear the burdens of the people with you; you will not bear it alone. 
NUM.11.18	And you will say to the people, ‘Sanctify yourselves tomorrow, for you will eat meat because you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, “Who will feed us good meat? It was good for us in Egypt.” Yahweh will give to you meat, and you will eat. 
NUM.11.19	You will eat, not one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days, 
NUM.11.20	but for a whole month,
NUM.11.21	But Moses said, “There are six hundred thousand on foot, among whom I am in the midst, and you yourself said, ‘I will give meat to them, and they will eat for a whole month.’ 
NUM.11.22	Should flocks and cattle be slaughtered for them? Should all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be enough for them?” 
NUM.11.23	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Is Yahweh’s power limited?
NUM.11.24	So Moses went out, and he spoke the words of Yahweh to the people, and he gathered together seventy men from the elders of the people, and he made them stand
NUM.11.25	Then Yahweh went down in the cloud and spoke to him, and he took away the spirit that was on him, and he put it
NUM.11.26	But two men were left in the camp; the name of one was Eldad, and the name of the second was Medad, and the spirit rested on them; they were among those who were written down, but they did not go out to the tent, so they prophesied in the camp. 
NUM.11.27	So a boy
NUM.11.28	And Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from time of his youth, answered, “Moses, my lord, stop them.” 
NUM.11.29	But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? Would that he
NUM.11.30	Then Moses and the elders of Israel were gathered to the camp. 
NUM.11.31	Then a wind set out from Yahweh, and it drove quails from the west, and he spread them out on the camp about a day’s journey on one side and about a day’s journey on the other, all around the camp, about two cubits on the surface of the land. 
NUM.11.32	And so the people worked
NUM.11.33	While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was consumed, Yahweh was angry with the people, and Yahweh struck a very great plague among the people. 
NUM.11.34	And he called the name of that place Kibroth Hattaavah
NUM.11.35	From Kibroth Hattaavah
NUM.12.1	And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he took (because he took a Cushite wife); 
NUM.12.2	and they said, “Has Yahweh spoken only through Moses? Has not Yahweh also spoken through us?” And Yahweh heard it. 
NUM.12.3	Now the man, Moses, was more humble than any other person on the face of the earth, 
NUM.12.4	and Yahweh said suddenly to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “Go out, you three, to the tent of assembly.” So the three of them when out. 
NUM.12.5	And Yahweh went down in a column of cloud and stood at the doorway of the tent, and he called Aaron and Miriam, and the two of them went, 
NUM.12.6	and he said, 
NUM.12.6	“Please hear my words: 
NUM.12.6	If there is a prophet among you, I, Yahweh, 
NUM.12.6	will make myself known to him in a vision. 
NUM.12.6	I will speak to him in a dream.
NUM.12.7	Not so with my servant Moses; 
NUM.12.7	in all my house he is faithful. 
NUM.12.8	I will speak to him mouth to mouth, 
NUM.12.8	in clearness, not in riddles; 
NUM.12.8	and he will look at the form of Yahweh. 
NUM.12.8	Why were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?” 
NUM.12.9	And Yahweh became very angry
NUM.12.10	And the cloud departed from on the tent, and behold, Miriam was infected with a skin disease
NUM.12.11	So Aaron said to Moses, “Please, my lord, please do not put on us this sin in which we were foolish and in which we have sinned. 
NUM.12.12	Please do not let her be like the dead, whose flesh is half consumed when coming out from the womb of its mother.” 
NUM.12.13	And Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, “God, please heal her!”
NUM.12.14	But Yahweh said to Moses, “If her father had surely spit in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be confined for seven days to an outside place of the camp, and afterward she may be gathered.” 
NUM.12.15	So Miriam was confined to the outside place of the camp seven days, and the people did not set out until Miriam was gathered. 
NUM.12.16	And afterward the people set out from Hazeroth, and they encamped in the desert of Paran. 
NUM.13.1	And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.13.2	“Send for yourself men, and let them explore the land of Canaan, which I am about to give to the Israelites;
NUM.13.3	So Moses sent them from the desert of Paran on the command of Yahweh; all of the men were leaders
NUM.13.4	And these are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur; 
NUM.13.5	from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori; 
NUM.13.6	from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; 
NUM.13.7	from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph; 
NUM.13.8	from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun; 
NUM.13.9	from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu; 
NUM.13.10	from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi; 
NUM.13.11	from the tribe of Joseph, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi son of Susi; 
NUM.13.12	from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli; 
NUM.13.13	from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael; 
NUM.13.14	from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi; 
NUM.13.15	from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki. 
NUM.13.16	These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to explore the land. And Moses called Hoshea son of Nun Joshua. 
NUM.13.17	Moses sent them to explore the land of Canaan, and he said to them, “Go up like this to the Negev,
NUM.13.18	and you will see what the land is like and if the people who inhabit it are strong or weak, or whether they are few or many, 
NUM.13.19	and whether the land that they are inhabiting is good or bad, and whether the cities they are inhabiting are camps or fortifications, 
NUM.13.20	and whether the land is fertile or lean, and whether there are trees on it or not. You will show yourself courageous, and you will take some of the fruit of the land.” It was the time of first ripe grapes. 
NUM.13.21	So they went up and explored the land from the desert of Zin until Rehob, at Lebo Hamath.
NUM.13.22	They went up through the Negev
NUM.13.23	And they came up to the valley
NUM.13.24	That place he called the valley
NUM.13.25	They returned from exploring the land at the end of forty days.
NUM.13.26	And they came
NUM.13.27	And they told him,
NUM.13.28	Yet the people who are inhabiting it are strong and the cities are fortified and very large; moreover, we saw the descendants of the Anakites there. 
NUM.13.29	The Amalekites are living in the land of the Negev;
NUM.13.30	And Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, “Surely, let us go up and let us take possession of it because surely we will be able to prevail over it.” 
NUM.13.31	And the men who went up with him said, “We are not able to go up to the people because they are stronger than us.” 
NUM.13.32	And they presented the report of the land that they explored to the Israelites,
NUM.13.33	There we saw the Nephilim (the descendants
NUM.14.1	Then all the community lifted up their voices,
NUM.14.2	And all the Israelites
NUM.14.3	Why did Yahweh bring us into this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little children will become plunder; would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?” 
NUM.14.4	They said to each other,
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before
NUM.14.6	Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, from the explorers of the land, tore their garments. 
NUM.14.7	And they said to all the community of the Israelites,
NUM.14.8	If Yahweh delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and he will give it to us, a land that is flowing with milk and honey. 
NUM.14.9	Only do not rebel against Yahweh, and you will not fear the people of the land, because they will be our food. Their protection
NUM.14.10	And all the community said to stone them with stones, but the glory of Yahweh appeared in the tent of assembly among the Israelites.
NUM.14.11	And Yahweh said to Moses, “How long until this people will despise me, and how long until they will not believe in me, and in all the signs that I have done in their
NUM.14.12	I will strike them
NUM.14.13	And Moses said to Yahweh, “Then the Egyptians will hear that you brought up this people from their
NUM.14.14	and they will tell it
NUM.14.15	But if you destroy this people all at once,
NUM.14.16	‘Yahweh was unable to bring this people in the land that he swore by an oath, and he slaughtered them in the desert.’ 
NUM.14.17	But now, please, let the power of my Lord be great, just has you spoke, 
NUM.14.18	‘Yahweh is slow to anger
NUM.14.18	and great of loyal love, 
NUM.14.18	forgiving
NUM.14.18	but surely he leaves nothing unpunished, 
NUM.14.18	visiting the sin of the fathers on the sons 
NUM.14.18	to the third and fourth generations.’ 
NUM.14.19	Please forgive the sin of this people according to the greatness of your loyal love, just as you forgave
NUM.14.20	Yahweh said, “I have forgiven them according to your word; 
NUM.14.21	but as I am alive, the glory of Yahweh will fill all the earth. 
NUM.14.22	But because all the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I did in Egypt and in the desert yet tested me these ten times and did not listen to my voice, 
NUM.14.23	they will not see the land that I swore by oath to their ancestors,
NUM.14.24	But my servant Caleb, because another spirit was with him, he remained true after me, and I will bring him into the land that he entered,
NUM.14.25	And the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys; tomorrow turn and set out for the desert by way of the Red Sea.”
NUM.14.26	And Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 
NUM.14.27	“How long will I bear this evil community who are grumbling against me? I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites
NUM.14.28	Say to them, ‘Surely as I live,’ declares
NUM.14.29	in this desert your corpses will fall, and all your counted ones, according to all your number, from twenty years old
NUM.14.30	You yourselves will not come into the land that I swore by oath
NUM.14.31	But your little children, whom you said would be plunder, I will bring them, and they will know the land that you rejected. 
NUM.14.32	But for you, all your corpses will fall in this desert. 
NUM.14.33	And your children will be shepherds in the desert forty years,
NUM.14.34	According to the number of the days
NUM.14.35	I, Yahweh, have spoken; I will surely do this to all this evil community who has banded together against me. In this desert they will come to an end, and there they will die.” 
NUM.14.36	As for the men whom Moses sent to explore the land, who returned and made the community grumble against him by spreading a report over the land, 
NUM.14.37	the men who spread the evil report of the land died by the plague before Yahweh.
NUM.14.38	But Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh lived from among the men who went to explore the land. 
NUM.14.39	And Moses spoke words to all the Israelites,
NUM.14.40	They rose early in the morning and went to the top of the mount, saying, “Here we are. We will go up to the place that Yahweh said, because we have sinned.” 
NUM.14.41	But Moses said, “Why are you going against the command of Yahweh? It will not succeed. 
NUM.14.42	You should not go up because Yahweh is not in your midst; do not let yourselves be defeated in the presence of your enemies, 
NUM.14.43	because the Amalekites
NUM.14.44	But they dared to go to the top of the mountain, and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and Moses did not depart from the midst of the camp. 
NUM.14.45	So the Amalekites
NUM.15.1	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.15.2	“Speak to the Israelites
NUM.15.3	you will make an offering by fire for Yahweh from the cattle or from the flock, a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, or as a freewill offering or at your feasts, to make a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh. 
NUM.15.4	And the one who presents an offering
NUM.15.5	and you will add a fourth of wine for the libation upon the burnt offering, or to the sacrifice for each ram-lamb. 
NUM.15.6	Or for the ram you will make a grain offering of two-tenths of finely milled flour mixed into a third of a liquid measure of oil. 
NUM.15.7	You will present a third of the liquid measure of wine for the libation, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh. 
NUM.15.8	When you prepare a bull
NUM.15.9	you will present with the bull
NUM.15.10	and you will present half a liquid measure of wine as a libation, as an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh. 
NUM.15.11	“ ‘This is how it should be done for each bull, or for the each ram, or for the small four-footed mammal, or ram-lambs, or goats. 
NUM.15.12	According to the number that you prepare, so should you do to each according to their number. 
NUM.15.13	Every native must do these things to present an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh. 
NUM.15.14	If an alien dwells among you, or whoever is in your midst throughout your generations,
NUM.15.15	For the assembly, there will be one decree for you and for the alien who dwells among you; it is an eternal decree for all your generations. You as well as the alien
NUM.15.16	There will be one law and one stipulation for you and for the alien dwelling among you.’ ” 
NUM.15.17	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.15.18	“Speak to the Israelites
NUM.15.19	whenever you eat from the food of the land, you will lift up a contribution to Yahweh. 
NUM.15.20	You must lift up a contribution of the first batch of your ring-shaped dough bread; you must lift it up as a contribution of the threshing floor. 
NUM.15.21	You will give to Yahweh a contribution from the first of your dough throughout your generations.
NUM.15.22	“ ‘But if you go astray and you do not follow
NUM.15.23	all that Yahweh commanded you by the hand of Moses
NUM.15.24	and if it was done unintentionally without the knowledge
NUM.15.25	The priest will make atonement for all of the community of the Israelites,
NUM.15.26	All of the community of the Israelites
NUM.15.27	“ ‘If one person sins unintentionally, that person will present a female goat in its first year
NUM.15.28	And the priest will make atonement for the person who sinned unintentionally
NUM.15.29	For the native among the Israelites
NUM.15.30	But the one who acts presumptuously
NUM.15.31	Because he despised the word of Yahweh and broke his command, that person will be surely cut off and bear the guilt.’ ” 
NUM.15.32	When the Israelites
NUM.15.33	The ones who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron, and to all the community. 
NUM.15.34	And they put him under watch because it was not made clear what should be done to him. 
NUM.15.35	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Surely the man must be put to death by stoning him; all the community must stone him with stones from outside the camp.” 
NUM.15.36	So the entire community brought him out to a place outside the camp, and they stoned him to death
NUM.15.37	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.15.38	“Speak to the Israelites,
NUM.15.39	You will have a tassel for you to look at
NUM.15.40	so that you will remember and do all my commandments, and you will be holy for your God. 
NUM.15.41	I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God; I am Yahweh your God.” 
NUM.16.1	Now Korah son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, the descendants
NUM.16.2	took two hundred and fifty men from the Israelites,
NUM.16.3	They were assembled in front of Moses and Aaron, and they said to them, “You take too much upon yourselves!
NUM.16.4	When Moses heard this, he fell on his face. 
NUM.16.5	And he said to Korah and to his entire company, saying, “Tomorrow morning Yahweh will make known who is his and who is holy, and he will bring him near to him, whomever he chooses he will bring near to him. 
NUM.16.6	Do this: take for yourselves censers, Korah and all of your company;
NUM.16.7	tomorrow put fire in them and place incense on them before
NUM.16.8	And Moses said to Korah, “Please listen, sons of Levi! 
NUM.16.9	Is it too little for you that the God of Israel set you apart from the community of Israel to allow you to approach him
NUM.16.10	He has allowed you to approach him,
NUM.16.11	Therefore you and your company that has banded together against Yahweh. What is Aaron that you grumble against him?” 
NUM.16.12	Moses sent to call for Dathan and Abiram son of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come!
NUM.16.13	Is it too little that you have brought us from a land that flows with milk and honey to kill us in the desert, and that you also appoint yourself as a ruler over us? 
NUM.16.14	Surely, you have not brought us to a land that flows with milk and honey, and you have not given us the inheritance of fields and a vineyard. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not come!”
NUM.16.15	Then Moses became angry, and he said to Yahweh, “Do not notice their grain offering. I have not offered one donkey from them, and I have not mistreated one of them.” 
NUM.16.16	And Moses said to Korah, “You and your entire company will be before
NUM.16.17	Each one take his censer, and put incense on it
NUM.16.18	So each of them took his censer, and they put fire on them, and they placed incense on them; they stood at the doorway of the tent of the assembly of Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.16.19	And Korah summoned them, the entire community, by the doorway of the tent of assembly, and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the community. 
NUM.16.20	And Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 
NUM.16.21	“Separate yourselves from the midst of this community, that I can destroy them in a moment.” 
NUM.16.22	And they fell on their faces, and they said, “God, God of the spirits of all flesh, will one man sin and you become angry toward the entire community?” 
NUM.16.23	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.16.24	“Speak to the community, saying, ‘Move away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’ ” 
NUM.16.25	So Moses stood up and went to Dathan and Abiram; the elders of Israel followed after him. 
NUM.16.26	He said to the community, saying, “Please turn away from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything that belongs to them,
NUM.16.27	And so they moved away from around the dwellings
NUM.16.28	And Moses said, “In this you will know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; it is not from my heart. 
NUM.16.29	If they die a natural death
NUM.16.30	But if Yahweh creates something new, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up and all that belongs to them,
NUM.16.31	And it happened, as soon as he finished speaking
NUM.16.32	The land opened its mouth and swallowed them up with their houses and every person that belonged to Korah
NUM.16.33	They went down alive to Sheol, they and all that belonged to them, and the land covered over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly. 
NUM.16.34	All Israel who were around them fled at their cry, because they said, “Lest the land swallow us up!” 
NUM.16.35	And fire went out from Yahweh, and it consumed the two hundred and fifty men presenting the incense. 
NUM.16.36	 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.16.37	“Say to Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, ‘Take out
NUM.16.38	The censers of these who have sinned
NUM.16.39	Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers that the ones who were burned presented, and they hammered them out thinly as plating for the altar; 
NUM.16.40	it was a memorial for the Israelites,
NUM.16.41	The next day all the community of the Israelites
NUM.16.42	Then, when the community had gathered against Moses and Aaron, they turned to the tent of assembly, and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Yahweh appeared. 
NUM.16.43	And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of assembly, 
NUM.16.44	and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.16.45	“Get away from the midst of this community, and I will finish them in an instant,”
NUM.16.46	And Moses and Aaron said, “Take the censer, and put fire on it from the altar. Place incense on it, and bring it quickly to the community, and make atonement for them, because wrath went out from the presence of Yahweh, and a plague has begun.” 
NUM.16.47	And so Aaron took it just as Moses had spoken, and he ran into the midst of the assembly, for behold, the plague had begun among the people; so he gave the incense and made atonement for the people. 
NUM.16.48	He stood between the dead and between the living, and the plague was stopped. 
NUM.16.49	Those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died on account of Korah. 
NUM.16.50	Then Aaron returned to Moses at the doorway of the tent of assembly, and the plague was stopped. 
NUM.17.1	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.17.2	“Speak to the Israelites,
NUM.17.3	and the name of Aaron on the staff of Levi, because one staff is for the head of each of their families.
NUM.17.4	You must then put them in the tent of assembly before
NUM.17.5	And it will happen, the man whom I will choose, his staff will blossom, and so I will rid from upon myself the grumblings of the Israelites,
NUM.17.6	Moses spoke to the Israelites,
NUM.17.7	And Moses put the staffs before Yahweh in the tent of testimony. 
NUM.17.8	Then the next day, Moses went into the tent of the testimony, and behold the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi blossomed and put forth a flower and produced blossoms, and it produced almonds. 
NUM.17.9	Then Moses brought out to all the Israelites
NUM.17.10	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Bring back the staff of Aaron before the testimony
NUM.17.11	So Moses did; just as Yahweh commanded him, so he did. 
NUM.17.12	And the Israelites
NUM.17.13	Anyone who approaches the tabernacle of Yahweh will die. Will we all die?”
NUM.18.1	Yahweh said to Aaron, “You, your sons, and your family with you will bear the guilt of the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you will bear the guilt of your priesthood. 
NUM.18.2	Moreover, bring your brothers with you, the tribe of Levi the tribe of your father, that they may be joined to you and minister to you, you and your sons with you before the tent of testimony. 
NUM.18.3	They will keep your responsibility and the responsibility of all the tent, only they may not come near the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, so both you and they will not die. 
NUM.18.4	They will be joined to you, and they will keep the responsibility of the tent of assembly for the entire service of the tent; a stranger may not come near you. 
NUM.18.5	You will keep the responsibility of the sanctuary and the responsibility of the altar, and there will no longer be wrath on the Israelites.
NUM.18.6	Look, I myself have chosen your brothers the Levites from the midst of the children. They are a gift to you given from Yahweh to perform the work of the tent of assembly. 
NUM.18.7	But you with your sons will keep your priesthood to perform your priestly duties for everything at the altar
NUM.18.8	Yahweh spoke to Aaron, “Behold, I myself have given to you the responsibility of my contributions for all the holy objects of the Israelites;
NUM.18.9	This will be for you from the sanctuary of the holy things from the fire; all of their offerings, from every grain offering, from every sin offering, and from every guilt offering which they will bring to me is a most holy thing
NUM.18.10	You will eat it in the most holy place;
NUM.18.11	This is also for you: the contribution of their gift of the wave offerings of the children Israel. I have given them to you and your sons and your daughters with you as an eternal decree; whoever is clean in your house may eat it. 
NUM.18.12	All the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and their best grain that they have given to Yahweh, I have given them to you. 
NUM.18.13	The firstfruits of all that is in their land that they present to Yahweh will be for you; whoever is clean in your house may eat it. 
NUM.18.14	All consecrated possessions
NUM.18.15	All the first offspring of a womb of any creature that they offer to Yahweh, whether human or animal, will be yours; you will surely redeem the firstborn of the human and the unclean firstborn of the animal. 
NUM.18.16	As to their price of redemption, from a one-month-old
NUM.18.17	Only the firstborn of an ox or the firstborn of a sheep or the firstborn of a goat you will not redeem; they are holy. Their blood you will sprinkle over the altar, and their fat you will turn into smoke as an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh. 
NUM.18.18	But their flesh will be for you like the breast section of the wave offering, and it will be for you like the right upper thigh. 
NUM.18.19	All the contributions of holiness that the Israelites
NUM.18.20	Then Yahweh said to Aaron, “You will not receive an inheritance in their land, and there will not be a plot of ground for you in the midst of the Israelites.
NUM.18.21	“Behold, I have given to the descendants
NUM.18.22	The Israelites
NUM.18.23	The Levites
NUM.18.24	because the tithes
NUM.18.25	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.18.26	“You will speak to the Levites and say to them, ‘When you receive the tithe from the Israelites
NUM.18.27	Your contribution will be credited to you like the grain from the threshing floor and like the produce from the press. 
NUM.18.28	So you will present
NUM.18.29	From all your gifts you will present
NUM.18.30	You will say to them, ‘When you are presenting
NUM.18.31	You may eat it anywhere, you and your household, because it is a wage in return for your service in the tent of assembly. 
NUM.18.32	You will not bear any sin because you have presented
NUM.19.1	And Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 
NUM.19.2	“This is the decree of the law that Yahweh has commanded, saying, ‘Speak to the Israelites
NUM.19.3	And you will give it to Eleazar the priest, and it will be brought
NUM.19.4	Then Eleazar the priest will take some of its blood on his finger and spatter it toward the mouth of the tent of assembly seven times. 
NUM.19.5	The heifer will be burned
NUM.19.6	The priest will take cedar wood, hyssop, and crimson thread, and he will throw them in the midst of the burning heifer.
NUM.19.7	The priest will wash his garments and his body in the water, and afterward he will come to the camp; the priest will be unclean until the evening. 
NUM.19.8	The one who burns it will wash his garments and his body in water; he will be unclean until the evening. 
NUM.19.9	A clean man will gather the ashes of the heifer, and he will put them in a clean place outside the camp;
NUM.19.10	The one who gathers the ashes of the heifer will wash his garments; he will be unclean until evening. It will be an eternal decree for the Israelites
NUM.19.11	“ ‘The one who touches a corpse of any person
NUM.19.12	He will purify himself on the third day, and on the seventh day he will be clean. If he does not purify himself on the third day, he will not be clean on the seventh day. 
NUM.19.13	Anyone who touches a corpse, the person of a human being who died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of Yahweh, and that person will be cut off from Israel because the waters of impurity were not sprinkled on him. He will still be unclean, and uncleanness is on him. 
NUM.19.14	“ ‘This is the law of a person who dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent and all who are in the tent will be unclean seven days. 
NUM.19.15	Every container that is opened that does not have a lid cord
NUM.19.16	Anyone in the open field
NUM.19.17	For the unclean person they will take
NUM.19.18	A clean person will take hyssop and dip it into the water and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the objects and persons who were there, and on one who touched the bone, or the one slain, or the dead, or the burial site. 
NUM.19.19	The clean person will spatter the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he will purify him, and he will wash his garments; he will bathe in the waters, and in the evening he will be clean. 
NUM.19.20	But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself, that person will be cut off from the midst of the assembly because he defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh; the water of impurity was not sprinkled on him; he is unclean. 
NUM.19.21	“ ‘It will be an eternal decree for them. The one who spatters the waters of impurity will wash his garments, and the one who touches the waters of impurity will be unclean until the evening. 
NUM.19.22	Anything that the unclean person touches will be unclean, and the person who touches it will be unclean until the evening.’ ” 
NUM.20.1	Then the entire community of the Israelites
NUM.20.2	There was no water for the community, and they were gathered before Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.20.3	And the people quarreled with Moses and spoke, saying, “If only we died when our brothers were dying before
NUM.20.4	Why have you brought the assembly of Yahweh, us and our livestock, into this desert to die here? 
NUM.20.5	Why have you brought us from Egypt to bring us to this bad place? It is not a place of seed or figs
NUM.20.6	And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent of assembly. They fell on their faces, and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them. 
NUM.20.7	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.20.8	“Take the staff and summon the community, you and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will give water. Bring out for them water from the rock, and let the community and their livestock drink.” 
NUM.20.9	So Moses took the staff from before
NUM.20.10	and Moses and Aaron summoned the assembly to the presence of the rock, and he said to them, “Please listen, you rebels; can we bring out water for you from this rock?” 
NUM.20.11	Then Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice. And abundant water went out, and the community and their livestock drank. 
NUM.20.12	But Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you have not trusted in me, to regard me as holy in the sight of
NUM.20.13	Those were the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites
NUM.20.14	From Kadesh Moses sent messengers to the king of Edom: “Thus your brother Israel has said, ‘You know all the hardship that has found us; 
NUM.20.15	our ancestors
NUM.20.16	Then we cried to Yahweh, and he heard our voice; he sent an angel and brought us out from Egypt. And look, we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory. 
NUM.20.17	Please let us go through your land. We will not go through a field or vineyard, and we will not drink water from a well. We will go along the road of the king; we will not turn aside right or left until we have gone through your territory.’ ” 
NUM.20.18	Then Edom said to him, “You will not pass through us
NUM.20.19	The Israelites
NUM.20.20	But he said, “You will not go through.” And Edom went out to meet them
NUM.20.21	So Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory, and Israel turned aside from him. 
NUM.20.22	And they set out from Kadesh. The Israelites,
NUM.20.23	Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron on Mount Hor, on the boundary of the land of Edom, saying, 
NUM.20.24	“Let Aaron be gathered to his people; he will not come into the land that I have given to the Israelites
NUM.20.25	Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and take them up Mount Hor. 
NUM.20.26	Strip off Aaron’s garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; Aaron will be gathered to his people, and he will die there.” 
NUM.20.27	So Moses did just as Yahweh commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor before the eyes of all the community. 
NUM.20.28	And Moses stripped off Aaron’s garments and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there on the top of the mountain; and Moses and Eleazar went down from the mountain. 
NUM.20.29	All the community saw that Aaron died; so all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.
NUM.21.1	The Canaanite king of Arad, who was dwelling in the Negev,
NUM.21.2	Israel made a vow to Yahweh, and they said, “If you will surely give this people into our
NUM.21.3	Yahweh heard the voice of Israel; he gave to them the Canaanites, and they destroyed them
NUM.21.4	They set out from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea
NUM.21.5	The people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us from Egypt to die in the desert? There is no food and no water, and our hearts detest this miserable food.” 
NUM.21.6	And Yahweh sent among the people poisonous snakes; they bit the people, and many people from Israel died. 
NUM.21.7	The people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned because we have spoken against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh and let him remove the snakes
NUM.21.8	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Make for yourself a snake and place it on a pole. When
NUM.21.9	So Moses made a snake of bronze, and he placed it on the pole; whenever
NUM.21.10	The Israelites
NUM.21.11	They set out from Oboth and encamped at Iye Abarim in the desert, which was in front of Moab toward the sunrise.
NUM.21.12	From there they set out and encamped at the valley of Zered. 
NUM.21.13	From there they set out and encamped beyond Arnon, which is in the desert that goes out from the boundary of the Amorites,
NUM.21.14	Therefore thus it is said in the scroll of the Wars of Yahweh, 
NUM.21.14	“Waheb in Suphah, 
NUM.21.14	and the wadis of Arnon, 
NUM.21.15	and the slope of the wadis 
NUM.21.15	that spreads out to the dwelling of Ar 
NUM.21.15	and lies at the boundary of Moab.” 
NUM.21.16	From there they went to Beer, which is the water well where Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Gather the people, that I may give them water.” 
NUM.21.17	Then Israel sang this song, “Arise, well water! Sing to it! 
NUM.21.18	Well water that the princes dug, that the leaders of the people dug, with a staff and with their rods.” And from the desert they continued to Mattanah, 
NUM.21.19	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth; 
NUM.21.20	and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the territory of Moab, by the top of Pisgah, which overlooks the surface of the wasteland. 
NUM.21.21	Israel sent messengers to Sihon, the king of the Amorites,
NUM.21.22	“Let us go through your land; we will not turn aside into a field or vineyard; we will not drink well water along the way of the king until we have gone through your territory.” 
NUM.21.23	But Sihon did not allow Israel to go through his territory. Sihon gathered all his people and went out to meet Israel; he came to the desert, to Jahaz, and he fought against Israel. 
NUM.21.24	But Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and they took possession of his land from Arnon to Jabbok, until the Ammonites,
NUM.21.25	Israel took all these cities, and Israel inhabited all the cities of the Amorites,
NUM.21.26	Because Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites,
NUM.21.27	Thus the ones who quote proverbs say, 
NUM.21.27	“Come to Heshbon! Let it be built! 
NUM.21.27	And let the city of Sihon be established. 
NUM.21.28	Because fire went out from Heshbon, 
NUM.21.28	a flame from the city of Sihon; 
NUM.21.28	it consumed Ar of Moab, 
NUM.21.28	the lords of the
NUM.21.29	Woe to you, Moab! 
NUM.21.29	You have perished, people of Chemosh. 
NUM.21.29	He has given his sons as fugitives, 
NUM.21.29	and his daughters into captivity, 
NUM.21.29	to the king of the Amorites,
NUM.21.30	We destroyed them; 
NUM.21.30	Heshbon has perished up to Dibon; 
NUM.21.30	we laid waste up to Nophah, 
NUM.21.30	which reaches
NUM.21.31	Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
NUM.21.32	Moses sent to explore Jaazer; they captured its environs
NUM.21.33	Then they turned and went up by the way of the Bashan, and Og king of the Bashan and all his people went out to meet them for battle at Edrei. 
NUM.21.34	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Do not fear him because I will give him and all his people and all his land into your hand. You will do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,
NUM.21.35	And so they destroyed him and his sons, and all his people until they had not spared a survivor; and they took possession of his land. 
NUM.22.1	The Israelites
NUM.22.2	Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel did to the Amorites,
NUM.22.3	and Moab was very terrified in the presence of the people because they
NUM.22.4	And Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now the crowd will lick up all around us, like a bull devours the grass of the field.” And Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. 
NUM.22.5	He sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the river,
NUM.22.6	Now, please go, curse this people for me because they
NUM.22.7	So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian went with a fee for divination in their hand; they came to Balaam and spoke the words of Balak to him. 
NUM.22.8	He said to them, “Spend the night here, and I will return, and I will return word to you, just as Yahweh speaks to me.” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. 
NUM.22.9	And God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men with you?” 
NUM.22.10	And Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent word to me, 
NUM.22.11	‘Look! A people went out from Egypt. Look! They cover the surface of the land.
NUM.22.12	God said to Balaam, “You will not go with them; you will not curse the people, because they
NUM.22.13	Balaam got up in the morning, and he said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land, because Yahweh refused to allow me to go with you.” 
NUM.22.14	The princes of Moab got up and went to Balak, and they said, “Balaam refused to come with us.” 
NUM.22.15	Balak again sent many princes, who were more honored than the former.
NUM.22.16	They came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak son of Zippor, ‘Please, let nothing keep you from coming to me 
NUM.22.17	because I will surely honor you greatly, and all that you say to me I will do. Please, come; curse this people for me.’ ” 
NUM.22.18	Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, “Even though Balak gives to me his house full of silver and gold, I am not able to go beyond the command of Yahweh
NUM.22.19	And now please, you also stay here
NUM.22.20	And God came to Balaam at night, and he said to him, “If the men have come to call you, get up and go with them; but only the word that I will speak to you, you will do.” 
NUM.22.21	So Balaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey, and he went with the princes of Moab. 
NUM.22.22	But God became angry
NUM.22.23	The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, and the donkey turned aside from the road and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back to the road. 
NUM.22.24	The angel of Yahweh stood in the narrow path of the vineyards, with a wall on either side.
NUM.22.25	When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she pressed herself into the wall, and she pressed the foot of Balaam into the wall, so he struck her again. 
NUM.22.26	Then the angel of Yahweh went further ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was not a way to turn aside to the right or left. 
NUM.22.27	When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she lay down under Balaam, so Balaam became angry,
NUM.22.28	Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What did I do to you that you struck me these three times?” 
NUM.22.29	Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you made a mockery of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now!” 
NUM.22.30	The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life until this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?” He said, “No.” 
NUM.22.31	Then Yahweh exposed the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, and he bowed down and worshiped to his face. 
NUM.22.32	The angel of Yahweh said to him, “Why have you struck this donkey three times? Look, I have come out as an adversary because your conduct is perverse before me. 
NUM.22.33	The donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times. If she had not turned aside from my face, then I would have killed you and kept her alive.” 
NUM.22.34	Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, “I have sinned because I did not know that you were standing to meet me in the road. Now, if it is displeasing to you,
NUM.22.35	The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but speak only the word that I will speak to you.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 
NUM.22.36	When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him by the city of Moab, which was on the boundary of Aaron at the end of the territory. 
NUM.22.37	And Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not urgently send to meet with you? Why did you not come to me? Am I really not able to honor you?” 
NUM.22.38	Balaam said to Balak, “Look, I came to you now. Am I really able to speak anything at all? I speak the word that God puts in my mouth.” 
NUM.22.39	Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-Huzoth. 
NUM.22.40	And Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and he sent them to Balaam and to the princes who were with him. 
NUM.22.41	And it happened, in the morning Balak took Balaam and took him up to Bamoth-Baal, and he saw from there the end of the nation. 
NUM.23.1	Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me this: seven altars. And prepare for me this: seven bulls and seven rams.” 
NUM.23.2	And Balak did just as Balaam spoke, and Balak offered Balaam a bull and a ram on the altar. 
NUM.23.3	And Balaam said to Balak, “Station yourself at your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me, and whatever he shows me I will tell to you.” So he went to a barren height. 
NUM.23.4	And God met with Balaam, and he said to him, “I have arranged seven altars, and I have offered a bull and a ram on the altar.” 
NUM.23.5	Yahweh put a word in the mouth of Balaam and said, “Return to Balak, and you must speak thus.” 
NUM.23.6	So he returned to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab. 
NUM.23.7	And he lifted up his oracle and said, 
NUM.23.7	“From Aram Balak lead me, 
NUM.23.7	from the mountains of the east the king of Moab, 
NUM.23.7	‘Go for me, curse Jacob, 
NUM.23.7	and go, denounce Israel.’ 
NUM.23.8	How can I curse whom God has not cursed, 
NUM.23.8	and how can I denounce whom Yahweh has not denounced? 
NUM.23.9	Because from the top of the rocks I see him, 
NUM.23.9	from hilltops I watch him. 
NUM.23.9	Behold, a people who dwell alone, 
NUM.23.9	they do not consider themselves among the nations. 
NUM.23.10	Who can count the dust of Jacob, 
NUM.23.10	or as a number the fourth part of Israel? 
NUM.23.10	Let my life die the death of an upright person, 
NUM.23.10	and let my end be like his!” 
NUM.23.11	And Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and look, you have surely blessed them!” 
NUM.23.12	He answered and said, “Should I not speak
NUM.23.13	Then Balak said, “Please walk with me to another place where you will see them, but you will only see part of them and will not see all of them; and curse them for me from there.” 
NUM.23.14	So he took him to the field of Zophim to the top of Pisgah, and he built seven altars, and he offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
NUM.23.15	Balaam
NUM.23.16	Then Yahweh met with Balaam, and he put a word in his mouth, and he said, “Return to Balak, and you must speak thus.” 
NUM.23.17	He came to him, and behold, he was standing at his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, “What has Yahweh spoken?” 
NUM.23.18	Then he uttered
NUM.23.18	“Stand up, Balak, and hear; 
NUM.23.18	listen to me, son of Zippor! 
NUM.23.19	God is not a man, that he should lie, 
NUM.23.19	nor a son of humankind, 
NUM.23.19	that he should change his mind. 
NUM.23.19	Has he said, and will he not do it? 
NUM.23.19	And has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it? 
NUM.23.20	Behold, I have received a command to bless; 
NUM.23.20	when he has blessed, I cannot cause it to return. 
NUM.23.21	He has no regard for evil in Jacob, 
NUM.23.21	and he does not see trouble in Israel; 
NUM.23.21	Yahweh his God is with him, 
NUM.23.21	and a shout
NUM.23.22	God, who brings them out from Egypt, 
NUM.23.22	is like the strength
NUM.23.23	Because there is no sorcery against Jacob, 
NUM.23.23	and there is no divination against Israel. 
NUM.23.23	Now
NUM.23.23	what God has done! 
NUM.23.24	Look! the people will rise like the lion; 
NUM.23.24	he raises himself and will not lie down 
NUM.23.24	until he eats the prey 
NUM.23.24	and drinks the blood of the slain.” 
NUM.23.25	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse them
NUM.23.26	But Balaam answered and said to Balak, “Did I not speak to you, saying, ‘Whatever Yahweh speaks I will do’?” 
NUM.23.27	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Please, come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will be acceptable to
NUM.23.28	So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which looks down on the face of the Jeshimon.
NUM.23.29	And Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me these seven altars, and prepare for me these seven bulls and seven rams.” 
NUM.23.30	Balak did just as Balaam said, and he offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
NUM.24.1	And Balaam saw that it pleased
NUM.24.2	Balaam lift up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to its tribes, and the spirit of God was upon it.
NUM.24.3	He uttered
NUM.24.3	“The declaration of Balaam son Beor, 
NUM.24.3	the declaration of the man whose eyes are closed, 
NUM.24.4	the declaration of the hearer of God’s words,
NUM.24.4	who sees the revelation of Shaddai,
NUM.24.4	falling down but whose eyes are uncovered. 
NUM.24.5	How good are your tents, O Jacob, 
NUM.24.5	your dwellings, O Israel! 
NUM.24.6	They are spread out like valleys, 
NUM.24.6	like gardens on a river, 
NUM.24.6	like aloes planted by Yahweh, 
NUM.24.6	like cedars at the waters. 
NUM.24.7	He will pour water from his buckets, 
NUM.24.7	and his offspring will be like many waters; 
NUM.24.7	his king will be higher than Agag, 
NUM.24.7	and his kingdom will be exalted. 
NUM.24.8	God, who brings him out from Egypt, 
NUM.24.8	is like the strength
NUM.24.8	He will devour the nations who are his enemies; 
NUM.24.8	he will break their bones; 
NUM.24.8	he will pierce them with his arrows. 
NUM.24.9	He crouches, he lies down like a lion, 
NUM.24.9	and like a lioness, who will rouse him? 
NUM.24.9	They who bless you will be blessed, 
NUM.24.9	and they who curse you will be cursed.” 
NUM.24.10	Then Balak became angry with
NUM.24.11	Flee
NUM.24.12	Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying, 
NUM.24.13	‘If Balak gave to me the fullness of his house full of silver and gold, I am not able to go beyond the command of Yahweh
NUM.24.14	And now, look, I am about to go to my people; I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the following days.”
NUM.24.15	And he uttered
NUM.24.15	“The declaration of Balaam son of Beor, 
NUM.24.15	and the declaration of the man whose eye is closed, 
NUM.24.16	the declaration of the hearer of God’s words,
NUM.24.16	and the knower of the knowledge of the Most High, 
NUM.24.16	who sees the vision of Shaddai,
NUM.24.16	who is falling, and his eyes are revealed. 
NUM.24.17	I see him, but not now; 
NUM.24.17	I behold him, but not near; 
NUM.24.17	a star will go out from Jacob, 
NUM.24.17	and a scepter will rise from Israel; 
NUM.24.17	it will crush the foreheads of Moab 
NUM.24.17	and destroy all the children of Seth. 
NUM.24.18	Edom will be a captive; 
NUM.24.18	Seir, its enemies, will be a captive, 
NUM.24.18	and Israel will be acting courageously.
NUM.24.19	Someone
NUM.24.19	and will destroy a remnant
NUM.24.20	And he looked at Amalek, uttered
NUM.24.20	“Amalek is first
NUM.24.20	but his future will be forever ruin.” 
NUM.24.21	And he looked at the Kenites,
NUM.24.21	“Steady is your dwelling place; 
NUM.24.21	in the rock is your nest. 
NUM.24.22	Nevertheless, the Kenite will be burned; 
NUM.24.22	how long will Asshur keep
NUM.24.23	Again he uttered
NUM.24.23	“Woe, who will live when God establishes this?
NUM.24.24	The ships will come from the hand of the Kittim, 
NUM.24.24	and they will afflict Asshur and will afflict Eber; 
NUM.24.24	also he will be forever ruin.” 
NUM.24.25	Then Balaam got up and went and returned to his place, and Balak also went on his way. 
NUM.25.1	When Israel dwelled in Shittim, the people began to prostitute
NUM.25.2	And they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and worshiped their gods. 
NUM.25.3	So Israel was joined together to Baal Peor, and Yahweh became angry
NUM.25.4	Yahweh said to Moses, “Take all the leaders
NUM.25.5	So Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Each of you kill his men who are joined together with Baal Peor.” 
NUM.25.6	And behold, a man from the Israelites
NUM.25.7	When Phinehas son of Eleazar son of Aaron the priest saw, he got up from the midst of the community and took a spear in his hand. 
NUM.25.8	He went after the man of Israel into the woman’s section of the tent, and he drove the two of them, the man of Israel and the woman, into her belly. And the plague among the Israelites
NUM.25.9	The ones who died in the plague were twenty-four thousand. 
NUM.25.10	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.25.11	“Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, turned away my anger from among the Israelites
NUM.25.12	Therefore say, ‘Behold, I am giving to him my covenant of peace, 
NUM.25.13	and it will be for him and his offspring
NUM.25.14	The name of the man of Israel who was struck with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, a leader of the family
NUM.25.15	The name of the Midianite woman who was struck was Cozbi daughter of Zur, a leader
NUM.25.16	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.25.17	“Attack the Midianites and strike them 
NUM.25.18	because they were attacking you with their deception, with which they have deceived you on the matter of Peor and on the matter of Cozbi the daughter of the leader of Midian, their sister who was struck on the day of the plague because of the matter of Peor.” 
NUM.26.1	 And it happened after the plague, 
NUM.26.2	“Take a census
NUM.26.3	So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them on the desert-plateau of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, saying, 
NUM.26.4	“Take a census of the community from those twenty years old
NUM.26.4	The Israelites who went out from the land of Egypt were: 
NUM.26.5	Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, the descendants
NUM.26.6	of Hezron, the clan of the Hezronites;
NUM.26.7	These are the clans of the Reubenites,
NUM.26.8	The children of Pallu: Eliab. 
NUM.26.9	The children of Eliab: Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the same Dathan and Abiram who were appointed of the community, who rebelled against Moses and Aaron in the company of Korah, when they rebelled against Yahweh, 
NUM.26.10	and the land opened its mouth and swallowed them with Korah, when that company died, when the fire consumed two hundred and fifty men, and they were a sign.
NUM.26.11	The children
NUM.26.12	The descendants
NUM.26.13	of Zerah, the clan of the Zerahites;
NUM.26.14	These were the clans of the Simeonites,
NUM.26.15	The descendants
NUM.26.16	of Ozni, the clan of the Oznites;
NUM.26.17	of Arod, the clan of the Arodites;
NUM.26.18	These were the clans of the descendants
NUM.26.19	The sons of Judah: Er and Onan; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. 
NUM.26.20	The descendants
NUM.26.21	The children of Perez were: of Hezron, the clan of the Hezronites;
NUM.26.22	These were the clans of Judah according to the ones counted of them, seventy-six thousand five hundred. 
NUM.26.23	The descendants
NUM.26.24	of Jashub, the clans of the Jashubites;
NUM.26.25	These were the clans of Issachar according to the ones counted of them, sixty-four thousand three hundred. 
NUM.26.26	The descendants
NUM.26.27	These were the clans of the Zebulunites
NUM.26.28	The descendants
NUM.26.29	The descendants
NUM.26.30	These were the descendants
NUM.26.31	and of Asriel, the clan of the Asrielites;
NUM.26.32	and of Shemida, the clan of the Shemidaites;
NUM.26.33	Zelophehad son of Hepher did not have sons, but only daughters; and the names
NUM.26.34	These were the clans of Manasseh, and the ones counted of them were fifty-two thousand seven hundred. 
NUM.26.35	These were the descendants
NUM.26.36	And these were the descendants
NUM.26.37	These were the clans of the descendants
NUM.26.38	The descendants
NUM.26.39	of Shephupham, the clan of the Shuphamites;
NUM.26.40	The sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman: of Ard, the clan of the Ardites;
NUM.26.41	These were the descendants
NUM.26.42	These were the descendants
NUM.26.43	All the clans of the Shuhamites,
NUM.26.44	The descendants
NUM.26.45	The descendants
NUM.26.46	The name of the daughter of Asher was Serah. 
NUM.26.47	These were the clans of the descendants
NUM.26.48	The descendants
NUM.26.49	of Jezer, the clan of the Jezerites;
NUM.26.50	These were the clans of Naphtali according to their clans, the ones counted of them, forty-five thousand four hundred. 
NUM.26.51	These were the ones counted of the Israelites,
NUM.26.52	Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.26.53	“For these the land must be divided as an inheritance according to the number of names. 
NUM.26.54	For the larger group you must increase their inheritance, and for the smaller group you must make smaller their inheritance; each must be given their
NUM.26.55	Surely the land will be divided by lot. They will inherit according to the names of the tribes of their ancestors.
NUM.26.56	Their
NUM.26.57	These are the ones counted of the Levites according to their clans: of Gershon, the clan of the Gershonites;
NUM.26.58	These are the clans of Levi: the clan of the Libnites,
NUM.26.59	The name of the wife of Amram was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whose mother bore her for Levi in Egypt; she bore to Amram: Aaron and Moses and their sister Miriam. 
NUM.26.60	To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
NUM.26.61	But Nadab and Abihu died when they presented strange fire before
NUM.26.62	The ones counted were twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old
NUM.26.63	These were the ones counted by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who counted the Israelites
NUM.26.64	And among these there was not a man of those counted by Moses and Aaron the priest, who counted the Israelites
NUM.26.65	For Yahweh said to them, “They will surely die in the desert.” And not a man was left over from them, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. 
NUM.27.1	Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, of the clan of Manasseh the son of Joseph, came near; and these were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, and Tirzah. 
NUM.27.2	They stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest and before the leaders of the entire community at the doorway of the tent of assembly,
NUM.27.3	“Our father died in the desert; he was not in the midst of the company of those who banded together against Yahweh in the company of Korah, but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons. 
NUM.27.4	Why should the name of our father disappear from the midst of his clan because he does not have a son? Give us property in the midst of the brothers of our father.” 
NUM.27.5	So Moses brought their case before Yahweh. 
NUM.27.6	And Yahweh said to Moses, saying, 
NUM.27.7	“The statements of the daughters of Zelophehad are right.
NUM.27.8	And you must speak to the Israelites,
NUM.27.9	And if he has no daughter, you must give his inheritance to his brothers. 
NUM.27.10	If he has no brothers, then you must give his inheritance to his father’s brothers. 
NUM.27.11	If his father has no brothers, then you must give his inheritance to his nearest relative from his own clan, and he will take possession of it. It will be as a decree of stipulation for the Israelites,
NUM.27.12	Yahweh said to Moses, “Go up to this mountain of Abarim, and see the land that I have given to the Israelites.
NUM.27.13	When you see it, you will be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother was gathered, 
NUM.27.14	because you rebelled against my word in the desert of Zin when the community quarreled regarding my holiness at the waters.” (These are the waters of Meribah-Kadesh in the desert of Zin.) 
NUM.27.15	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.27.16	“Let Yahweh, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the community 
NUM.27.17	who will go out before them and will come in before them, and who will lead them out and bring them in, so the community of Yahweh will not be like a flock that does not have a shepherd.” 
NUM.27.18	Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and place your hand on him. 
NUM.27.19	Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and before the entire community, and commission him
NUM.27.20	You will give to him from your authority so that the entire community of Israel will obey him.
NUM.27.21	He will stand before Eleazar the priest, who will ask for him by the decision
NUM.27.22	Moses did just as Yahweh commanded him, and he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before the entire community. 
NUM.27.23	And he placed his hands on him and commissioned him
NUM.28.1	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.28.2	“Command the Israelites
NUM.28.3	You will say to them, ‘This is the offering made by fire that you will offer to Yahweh: two male lambs without defect in their first year
NUM.28.4	You will offer one male lamb in the morning, and the second male lamb you will offer at twilight,
NUM.28.5	and a tenth of an ephah of finely milled flour as a grain offering, mixed with a fourth of a measure of beaten oil. 
NUM.28.6	It is a continual burnt offering that was ordained
NUM.28.7	The libation with it will be a fourth of a liquid measure for each male lamb; in the sanctuary you will pour out the libation of fermented drink for Yahweh. 
NUM.28.8	And the second male lamb you will offer at twilight;
NUM.28.9	“ ‘On the day of the Sabbath, two male lambs without defect in their first year,
NUM.28.10	This is the burnt offering every Sabbath in addition to the continual burnt offering and its libation. 
NUM.28.11	“ ‘And at the beginning of each of your months, you will present a burnt offering for Yahweh: two bulls and one ram, seven male lambs without defect in their first year;
NUM.28.12	and three-tenths of finely milled flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, for each bull; and two-tenths of finely milled flour mixed with oil for a grain offering for the one ram; 
NUM.28.13	and a tenth of finely milled flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each male lamb, for a burnt offering of a fragrance of appeasement, an offering of fire for Yahweh. 
NUM.28.14	Their libations will be half a liquid measure of wine for the bull and a third of a liquid measure of wine for the ram and a fourth of a liquid measure of wine for the male lamb; this is the burnt offering for every month for the months of the year. 
NUM.28.15	And one male goat as a sin offering for Yahweh; it will be offered in addition to the continual burnt offering and its libation. 
NUM.28.16	“ ‘On the fourteenth day of the first month is the Passover for Yahweh. 
NUM.28.17	On the fifteenth day of this month is a religious feast, unleavened bread must be eaten for seven days. 
NUM.28.18	On the first day there will be a holy convocation; you will not do any regular work.
NUM.28.19	You will present an offering by fire, a burnt offering for Yahweh: two bulls and one ram and seven male lambs in their first year;
NUM.28.20	For their grain offering, you will offer finely milled flour mixed with oil: three-tenths for the bull and two-tenths for the ram. 
NUM.28.21	You will offer a tenth for each of the seven male lambs; 
NUM.28.22	and a goat for one sin offering to make atonement for you. 
NUM.28.23	You will offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for the continual burnt offering. 
NUM.28.24	Like this you will offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh; it will be offered in addition to the continual burnt offering and its libation. 
NUM.28.25	On the seventh day you will have a holy convocation; you will not do any regular work.
NUM.28.26	“ ‘And on the day of firstfruits, when you are presenting a new offering for Yahweh during your Festival of Weeks, you will have a holy convocation; you will not do any regular work.

NUM.29.40	 So Moses said to the Israelites
NUM.30.1	Then Moses spoke to the leaders
NUM.30.2	if a man makes a vow for Yahweh or swears an oath with a binding pledge on himself, he must not render his word invalid; he must do all that went out from his mouth. 
NUM.30.3	“If a woman makes a vow to Yahweh, and she binds a pledge on herself in her father’s house in your childhood, 
NUM.30.4	but if her father hears her vow or her pledge that she bound on herself and says nothing to her, then all her vows will stand, and every pledge that she binds on her life will stand. 
NUM.30.5	If her father forbids her on the day he hears of it, all her vows or her pledges that she bound on herself will not stand, and Yahweh will forgive her because her father has forgiven her. 
NUM.30.6	“If she has a husband
NUM.30.7	and her husband hears of it and is silent on the day he hears it, her vows will stand, and her pledge that she bound upon herself will stand. 
NUM.30.8	But if on the day her husband hears of it, he forbids her, then he will nullify her vow that she is under, and the rash promise of her lips that she bound on herself; and Yahweh will forgive her. 
NUM.30.9	“But the vow of a widow or a woman who is divorced, all that she binds on herself will stand on her. 
NUM.30.10	But if she made a vow in her husband’s house, or bound herself on a pledge with a sworn oath, 
NUM.30.11	and her husband heard it but was silent to her, and he did not forbid her, all her vows will stand and every pledge that she bound on herself will stand. 
NUM.30.12	But if her husband nullified them on the day he hears them, all her vows going out of her lips concerning her vows or the pledge on herself will not stand; her husband has nullified them, and Yahweh will forgive her. 
NUM.30.13	“Any vow and any sworn oath of a pledge to inflict on herself, her husband can confirm it or her husband can nullify it. 
NUM.30.14	But if her husband is completely silent from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or all her pledges that are on her; he confirms them because he was silent to her on the day he heard them. 
NUM.30.15	But if he indeed nullifies them after he hears them, then he will bear her guilt.” 
NUM.30.16	These are the decrees that Yahweh commanded Moses, as between a husband and his wife, and between a father and his daughter, while her childhood is in her father’s house. 
NUM.31.1	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.31.2	“Seek vengeance for the Israelites
NUM.31.3	Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm yourself from among your men for the battle, so that they will go
NUM.31.4	A thousand from each tribe of every tribe of Israel you will send to battle.” 
NUM.31.5	So theywere assigned from the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand equipped for battle. 
NUM.31.6	Moses sent them, a thousand from each tribe, to the battle, and Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to the battle with them, and the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets of the blast were in his hand. 
NUM.31.7	And they fought against Midian just as Yahweh commanded Moses, and they killed every male. 
NUM.31.8	They killed the kings of Midian in addition to the ones they had slain: Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian; they also killed Balaam son of Beor by the sword. 
NUM.31.9	The Israelites
NUM.31.10	They burned all their cities where they dwelled and all their camps with fire. 
NUM.31.11	They took all the plunder and all the war-booty with the humans
NUM.31.12	They brought the captives, the war-booty, and the plunder to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the community of the Israelites,
NUM.31.13	And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went out to meet them outside the camp. 
NUM.31.14	But Moses was angry toward the leaders of the troops, the commanders of the thousands and the commanders of the hundreds, who came from the battle of the war. 
NUM.31.15	And Moses said to them, “You have kept alive every female? 
NUM.31.16	Behold, these women caused
NUM.31.17	Now kill every male among the little children, and kill every woman who has had sexual intercourse with a man.
NUM.31.18	But all the females who have not had sexual intercourse with a man,
NUM.31.19	And you, camp outside the camp seven days; all who killed a person and all who touched the slain purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives. 
NUM.31.20	You will purify yourselves and every garment and every object of hide and all the work of goats’ hair, and every object of wood.” 
NUM.31.21	Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of the battle who came from the war, “This is the decree of the law that Yahweh commanded Moses. 
NUM.31.22	Only the gold and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead—
NUM.31.23	everything that will go through the fire—you will pass through the fire, and it will be clean, and only in waters of impurity will it be purified. Whatever does not go into the fire you will pass through the waters. 
NUM.31.24	And you will wash your garments on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you will come into the camp.” 
NUM.31.25	Yahweh said to Moses, saying, 
NUM.31.26	“You and Eleazar the priest and the leaders of the families
NUM.31.27	divide the war-booty between those who engaged in the war, who went out to the battle, and all the community. 
NUM.31.28	Exact a tribute for Yahweh from the men of the war, those who went out to the battle, one from five hundred persons, and from the cattle and from the male donkeys and from the flock; 
NUM.31.29	take from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as a contribution to Yahweh. 
NUM.31.30	From half of the Israelites,
NUM.31.31	Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
NUM.31.32	Thus the war-booty that remained of the plunder that the people of the battle plundered was six hundred and seventy-five thousand flocks of sheep, 
NUM.31.33	seventy-two thousand cattle, 
NUM.31.34	sixty-one thousand male donkeys, 
NUM.31.35	and the life of humankind, from the women who did not have sexual intercourse with a man,
NUM.31.36	The half of the share that was going out to the battle: the number of the flock of sheep was thee hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred; 
NUM.31.37	the tribute to Yahweh from the flock was six hundred and seventy-five; 
NUM.31.38	and the cattle were thirty-six thousand; and the tribute to Yahweh was seventy-two. 
NUM.31.39	Of the male donkeys there were thirty thousand five hundred, and the tribute to Yahweh was sixty-one; 
NUM.31.40	the humans
NUM.31.41	And Moses gave away the tribute of the contribution of Yahweh to Eleazar the priest, just as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
NUM.31.42	From the half of the Israelites,
NUM.31.43	the half that belonged to the community was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred from the flock, 
NUM.31.44	and thirty-six thousand cattle, 
NUM.31.45	and thirty thousand five hundred male donkeys, 
NUM.31.46	and sixteen thousand humans.
NUM.31.47	From the half that belonged to the Israelites,
NUM.31.48	Then the leaders of the thousands of the army, the commanders of the thousands and the commanders of the hundreds, approached Moses, 
NUM.31.49	and they said to Moses, “Your servants have taken count
NUM.31.50	So we brought the offering of Yahweh, what each man found, objects of gold, bangles,
NUM.31.51	Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all objects of work. 
NUM.31.52	All the gold of the contribution that they raised up to Yahweh, from the commanders of the thousands and the commanders of the hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. 
NUM.31.53	The men of battle plundered each for himself. 
NUM.31.54	So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the commanders of the thousands and hundreds, and they brought it to the tent of the assembly as a memorial for the Israelites
NUM.32.1	The descendants
NUM.32.2	The descendants
NUM.32.3	“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon, 
NUM.32.4	the land that Yahweh struck before the community of Israel, is a land of livestock, and your servants have livestock.” 
NUM.32.5	They said, “If we have found favor in your sight,
NUM.32.6	But Moses said to the descendants
NUM.32.7	Why are you discouraging the hearts of the Israelites
NUM.32.8	This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land. 
NUM.32.9	When they went up to the valley
NUM.32.10	So Yahweh’s anger burned
NUM.32.11	‘The men who went up from Egypt, from those twenty years old
NUM.32.12	except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, because they followed Yahweh wholly.’ 
NUM.32.13	And Yahweh became angry,
NUM.32.14	Behold, you stand in the place of your fathers, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more Yahweh’s fierce anger
NUM.32.15	If you turn from following him, he will again abandon them
NUM.32.16	They came near to him and said, “We will build sheep pens here for the flock of our livestock and cities for our little children; 
NUM.32.17	but we ourselves will become armed and ready before the Israelites
NUM.32.18	We will not return to our houses until the Israelites
NUM.32.19	For we will not take possession with them from across the Jordan and beyond because our inheritance has come to us from across the Jordan to the east.” 
NUM.32.20	So Moses said to them, “If you do this thing, if you arm yourselves before
NUM.32.21	and everyone of you armed cross the Jordan before
NUM.32.22	and the land is subdued before
NUM.32.23	But if you do not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh, and know that your sin will find you. 
NUM.32.24	Build for yourselves cities for your little children and sheep pens for your flocks; what has gone out from your mouth you will do.” 
NUM.32.25	So the descendants
NUM.32.26	Our little children, our wives, our livestock, and all of our animals
NUM.32.27	but your servants, everyone who is armed for battle, will cross over before
NUM.32.28	So Moses commanded them, Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families
NUM.32.29	Moses said to them, “If the descendants
NUM.32.30	But if they will not cross over with you armed, they will acquire land in your midst in Canaan.” 
NUM.32.31	The descendants
NUM.32.32	We ourselves will cross over armed before
NUM.32.33	So Moses gave to them, to the descendants
NUM.32.34	The descendants
NUM.32.35	and Atroth Shophan, Jazer, and Jogbehah, 
NUM.32.36	and Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran, the cities of Mibzar, and the sheep pens for flocks. 
NUM.32.37	The descendants
NUM.32.38	and Nebo, Baal Meon (their names
NUM.32.39	The descendants
NUM.32.40	So Moses gave Gilead to Makir son of Manasseh, and he lived in it. 
NUM.32.41	And Jair son of Manasseh went and captured their unwalled villages, and he called them Havvoth Jair. 
NUM.32.42	Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages, and he called it Nobah after his own name. 
NUM.33.1	These were the journeys of the Israelites,
NUM.33.2	Moses wrote down their movements according to their journeys on the command of Yahweh, and these are their journeys according to their movements. 
NUM.33.3	They set out from Rameses on the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover the Israelites
NUM.33.4	while the Egyptians were burying all the firstborn among them whom Yahweh struck. Yahweh also executed punishments among their gods. 
NUM.33.5	Then the Israelites
NUM.33.6	They journeyed from Succoth and camped in Etham, which is on the edge of the desert. 
NUM.33.7	Then they set out from Etham and returned to Pi-Hahiroth, which faces Baal Zephon, and they camped before Migdol. 
NUM.33.8	They set out from Pi-Hahiroth and went through the midst of the sea into the desert; and they went a journey of three days into the desert of Etham and camped at Marah. 
NUM.33.9	They set out from Marah and came to Elim, and in Elim there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there. 
NUM.33.10	They set out from Elim, and they camped at the Red Sea.
NUM.33.11	They set out from the Red Sea
NUM.33.12	They set out from the desert of Sin and camped at Dophkah. 
NUM.33.13	They set out from Dophkah and camped at Alush. 
NUM.33.14	They set out from Alush and encamped at Rephidim; and it was there that the people had no water to drink. 
NUM.33.15	They set out from Rephidim and camped in the desert of Sinai. 
NUM.33.16	The set out from the desert of Sinai and camped at Kibroth Hattaavah. 
NUM.33.17	They set out from Kibroth Hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.

NUM.33.24	They set out from Mount Shapher and camped at Haradah. 
NUM.33.25	They set out from Haradah and camped at Makheloth. 
NUM.33.26	They set out from Makheloth and camped at Tahath. 
NUM.33.27	They set out from Tahath and camped at Terah. 
NUM.33.28	They set out from Terah and camped at Mithcah.

NUM.33.34	They set out from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah. 
NUM.33.35	They set out from Abronah and camped at Ezion Geber. 
NUM.33.36	They set out from Ezion Geber and camped in the desert of Zin, that is, Kadesh. 
NUM.33.37	They set out from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, at the edge of the land of Edom. 
NUM.33.38	Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the command
NUM.33.39	Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor. 
NUM.33.40	Now the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who was living in the Negev
NUM.33.41	Then they set out from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah. 
NUM.33.42	They set out from Zalmonah and camped at Punon. 
NUM.33.43	They set out from Punon and camped at Oboth. 
NUM.33.44	They set out from Oboth and camped at Iye Abarim, the boundary of Moab. 
NUM.33.45	They set out from Iyim and camped at Dibon Gad. 
NUM.33.46	They set out from Dibon Gad and camped at Almon-Diblatayim. 
NUM.33.47	They set out from Almon-Diblatayim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo. 
NUM.33.48	They set out from the mountains of Abarim and camped on the desert-plateau of Moab by the Jordan across Jericho. 
NUM.33.49	They camped by the Jordan, from Beth-Jeshimoth up to Abel Shittim, on the desert-plateau of Moab. 
NUM.33.50	Then Yahweh spoke to Moses on the desert-plateau of Moab by the Jordan across Jericho, saying, 
NUM.33.51	“Speak to the Israelites
NUM.33.52	you will drive out the inhabitants of the land from your presence, and you will destroy all their idols and all the images of their molten idols, and you will demolish all their high places; 
NUM.33.53	you will dispossess the land and live in it because I have given the land to you to possess it. 
NUM.33.54	You will distribute the land by lot according to your clans; to the larger group you will give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller group you will give less inheritance. However the lot falls for him, there the lot will be. You will distribute it according to the tribes of your ancestors.
NUM.33.55	But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from your presence, then it will happen that whomever you let remain of them will be like irritants in your eyes and like thorns in your sides; they will be your enemies in the land in which you live. 
NUM.33.56	And just as I planned to do to them, I will do to you.’ ” 
NUM.34.1	Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.34.2	“Command the Israelites
NUM.34.3	Your southern edge will be from the desert of Zin toward the side of Edom, and your southern border will be from the end of the Salt Sea
NUM.34.4	your boundary will turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim
NUM.34.5	The boundary will turn from Azmon to the valley of Egypt, and its limits will be to the sea. 
NUM.34.6	“ ‘Your western boundary will be the Great Sea;
NUM.34.7	Your northern border will be from the Great Sea;
NUM.34.8	From Mount Hor you will make a boundary to reach Hamath; the limits of the territory will be at Zedad. 
NUM.34.9	The boundary will go out to Ziphron, and its limits will be at Hazar Enan. This will be your boundary to the north. 
NUM.34.10	“ ‘You will mark out your eastern boundary from Hazar Enan to Shepham; 
NUM.34.11	the boundary will go down from Shepham to Riblah from the east side of Ain, and the boundary will go down and border on the eastern side of the Sea of Kinnereth. 
NUM.34.12	The boundary will go down to the Jordan, and its limits will be at the Salt Sea.
NUM.34.13	So Moses commanded the Israelites,
NUM.34.14	For the tribe of the children of the Reubenites,
NUM.34.15	The two and a half tribes have taken their inheritance from beyond the Jordan across Jericho, east toward the sunrise.” 
NUM.34.16	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.34.17	“These are the names of the men who divide up the land for your inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun. 
NUM.34.18	You will take one leader from every tribe to divide up the land for inheritance. 
NUM.34.19	These are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; 
NUM.34.20	of the tribe of the descendants of Simeon, Samuel son of Ammihud; 
NUM.34.21	of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad son of Chislon; 
NUM.34.22	of the tribe of the descendants
NUM.34.23	of the descendants
NUM.34.24	Of the tribe of the descendants
NUM.34.25	of the tribe of the descendants
NUM.34.26	of the tribe of the descendants
NUM.34.27	of the tribe of the descendants
NUM.34.28	of the tribe of the descendants
NUM.34.29	These are those whom Yahweh commanded to allot to the Israelites
NUM.35.1	Yahweh spoke to Moses on the desert plains of Moab beyond the Jordan across Jericho, saying, 
NUM.35.2	“Command the Israelites
NUM.35.3	The cities will be theirs to live in, and their pasturelands will be for their domestic animals, for their possessions, and their animals.
NUM.35.4	“The pasturelands of the cities that you will give to the Levites will extend from the wall of the city to a distance of a thousand cubits all around. 
NUM.35.5	You will measure outside the city the eastern edge two thousand cubits, for the southern edge two thousand cubits, for the western edge two thousand cubits, and for the northern edge two thousand cubits, with the city in the middle; this will be for them the pasturelands of the cities. 
NUM.35.6	“All the cities that you will give the Levites will be six cities of refuge, to which the killer can flee; in addition to them you will give forty-two cities. 
NUM.35.7	All the cities that you will give to the Levites will be forty-eight cities, them with their pasturelands. 
NUM.35.8	And the cities that you will give from the property of the Israelites,
NUM.35.9	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
NUM.35.10	“Speak to the Israelites
NUM.35.11	you will select for yourselves cities for your cities of refuge, that a killer who has killed a person unintentionally can flee there. 
NUM.35.12	The cities will be to you a refuge from a redeemer, so that the killer will not die until he stands before the community for judgment. 
NUM.35.13	The cities that you are to give will be your six cities of refuge. 
NUM.35.14	You will give three cities across the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan; they will be cities of refuge. 
NUM.35.15	To the Israelites,
NUM.35.16	“ ‘But if he hit him with an object of iron, so that he dies, the killer must surely be put to death. 
NUM.35.17	And if he hit him with a stone in the hand, by which he will die, and he does die, he is a killer; the killer must surely be put to death. 
NUM.35.18	Or if he hit him with a wooden object, by which he will die, and he does die, he is a killer; the killer must surely be put to death. 
NUM.35.19	The blood avenger himself will put the killer to death; he must put him to death when meeting him. 
NUM.35.20	If he shoves him in hatred, or he throws something at him with intention, and he dies, 
NUM.35.21	or if he hits him in hostility with his hand, and he dies, the one that struck him will put to death the killer when meeting him. 
NUM.35.22	“ ‘Or if in an instant he shoved him, not in hostility, or threw something at him without intention, 
NUM.35.23	or with any stone, without seeing it dropped on him so that he dies, while he was not seeking his injury, 
NUM.35.24	then the community will judge between the striker and between the blood avenger according to these ordinances. 
NUM.35.25	The community will deliver the killer from the hand of the blood avenger, and the community will restore him to the city of his refuge to which he fled; and he will live there in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with holy oil. 
NUM.35.26	But if the killer surely goes out of the territory of the city of his refuge to which he fled, 
NUM.35.27	and the blood avenger finds him outside the territory of the city of his refuge, and the blood avenger kills the killer, he will not be guilty of blood
NUM.35.28	because he must live in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the killer will return to the land of his property. 
NUM.35.29	These things will be as a decree of justice for you for your generations in all your dwellings. 
NUM.35.30	“ ‘If anyone kills a person, the killer will be put to death according to the testimony
NUM.35.31	Also, you will not take a ransom payment for the life of a killer who is guilty of death; indeed, he must surely be put to death. 
NUM.35.32	You will not take a ransom payment for the one that flees to the city of his refuge, so that he may return to live in the land before the death of the priest. 
NUM.35.33	So you will not pollute the land in which you are; because blood pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is poured out on it except with the blood of the one who poured it out. 
NUM.35.34	You will not defile the land on which you are living because I am living in the midst of it; I am Yahweh; I am living in the midst of the Israelites.’ ”
NUM.36.1	The leaders
NUM.36.2	And they said, “Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land by lot as an inheritance to the Israelites,
NUM.36.3	But if they become wives to one of the sons from another tribe of the Israelites,
NUM.36.4	When the Jubilee of the Israelites
NUM.36.5	Then Moses commanded the Israelites
NUM.36.6	This is the word that Yahweh commanded the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, ‘Let them marry
NUM.36.7	Thus an inheritance of the Israelites
NUM.36.8	Every daughter who possesses an inheritance from the tribes of the Israelites
NUM.36.9	Therefore an inheritance will not go around from one tribe to another tribe because the tribes of the Israelites
NUM.36.10	Just as Yahweh commanded to Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad did: 
NUM.36.11	Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, married
NUM.36.12	They married
NUM.36.13	These were the commands and the stipulations that Yahweh commanded by the hand of Moses
DEU.1.1	These are the words that Moses spoke to all of Israel on the other side of
DEU.1.2	It is a journey of eleven days
DEU.1.3	And it was
DEU.1.4	This happened after defeating
DEU.1.5	On the other side of 
DEU.1.6	“Yahweh our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying,
DEU.1.7	Turn now and move on,
DEU.1.8	Look, I have set the land before you;
DEU.1.9	“And I spoke to them at that time, saying,
DEU.1.10	Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and look; you are today as the stars of the heaven in number.
DEU.1.11	Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,
DEU.1.12	How can I bear you by myself,
DEU.1.13	Choose for yourselves wise and discerning and knowledgeable men
DEU.1.14	“And you answered me, and you said, ‘The thing you have said to do is good.’ 
DEU.1.15	And so I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and then I appointed them as leaders over you as commanders of groups of thousands and commanders of groups of hundreds and commanders of groups of fifties and commanders of groups of tens as officials for your tribes. 
DEU.1.16	And at that time I instructed your judges, saying, ‘hear out your fellow men,
DEU.1.17	You must not be partial
DEU.1.18	And so I instructed you at that time concerning all of the things that you should do. 
DEU.1.19	“Then we set out from Horeb, and we went through the whole of that great and terrible desert that you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites
DEU.1.20	I said to you, ‘You have reached
DEU.1.21	See, Yahweh your God has set before you the land; go up and possess it as Yahweh the God of your ancestors
DEU.1.22	“Then all of you approached me, and you said, ‘Let us send men before us,
DEU.1.23	The plan was good in my opinion,
DEU.1.24	And they set out
DEU.1.25	They took in their hands
DEU.1.26	But you were not willing to go up, and you rebelled against the command
DEU.1.27	And you grumbled in your tents, and you said, ‘Because of the hatred of Yahweh toward us he has brought us out from the land of Egypt to give us into the hand of the Amorites
DEU.1.28	Where can we go up? Our brothers have made our hearts melt,
DEU.1.29	“And so I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified, and do not fear them. 
DEU.1.30	Yahweh your God, who is going before you,
DEU.1.31	and just as he did in the wilderness
DEU.1.32	But through all of this you did not trust in Yahweh your God, 
DEU.1.33	who goes
DEU.1.34	“Then Yahweh heard the sound of your words, and he was angry, and he swore, saying,
DEU.1.35	‘No one of these men
DEU.1.36	except Caleb, the son of Jephunneh; he himself
DEU.1.37	Even with me Yahweh was angry because of you, saying, ‘Not even you shall enter there. 
DEU.1.38	Joshua, the son of Nun, your assistant,
DEU.1.39	And your little children, who you thought shall become plunder, and your sons, who do not today know good or bad, shall themselves
DEU.1.40	But you turn and set out in the direction of the wilderness by way of the Red Sea.’
DEU.1.41	“You replied and said to me, ‘We have sinned against Yahweh, and now we will go up and fight according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us’; and so each man fastened on his battle gear,
DEU.1.42	So Yahweh said to me, ‘Say to them, “You shall not go up, and you shall not fight because I am not in your midst; you will be defeated before
DEU.1.43	So I spoke to you, but you did not listen; you rebelled against the command of Yahweh;
DEU.1.44	The Amorites living in the hill country went out to oppose you
DEU.1.45	So you returned and wept before Yahweh;
DEU.1.46	You stayed in Kadesh many days; such were the days that you stayed there. 
DEU.2.1	 “Then we turned and set out toward the wilderness
DEU.2.2	Yahweh spoke to me, saying,
DEU.2.3	‘Long enough you have been skirting this mountain; turn yourselves north, 
DEU.2.4	and instruct
DEU.2.5	Do not get involved in battle
DEU.2.6	You shall buy food from them so that you may eat; and also you shall purchase water from them with money so that you may drink. 
DEU.2.7	The fact of the matter is, Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work you have done;
DEU.2.8	And so we passed by our brothers, the descendants
DEU.2.9	And Yahweh said to me, ‘You shall not attack Moab, and you shall not engage in war
DEU.2.10	(The Emim previously lived in it, a people large,
DEU.2.11	They were reckoned also as Rephaim as the Anakites were; but the Moabites called them Emim. 
DEU.2.12	The Horites previously lived in Seir, but the descendants
DEU.2.13	So now arise and cross over the wadi
DEU.2.14	Now the length of time
DEU.2.15	The hand of Yahweh was against them to root them out from the midst of the camp until they perished completely. 
DEU.2.16	“And then
DEU.2.17	Yahweh spoke to me, saying,
DEU.2.18	‘You are about to cross over the boundary of Moab today
DEU.2.19	When you approach the border of
DEU.2.20	(It is also considered the land of Rephaim; Rephaim lived in it previously,
DEU.2.21	a people great and numerous and as tall as the Anakites; Yahweh destroyed them from before them,
DEU.2.22	just as he did for the descendants
DEU.2.23	And also the Avvites, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, and the Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, destroyed them and then settled in their place. 
DEU.2.24	Arise,
DEU.2.25	This day I will begin to place the dread of you
DEU.2.26	“So I sent messengers from the wilderness
DEU.2.27	‘Let me cross through your land and only along the road
DEU.2.28	Food for money you shall sell me, so that I may eat, and water for money you will give to me, so that I may drink; just let me cross on foot. 
DEU.2.29	Just as the descendants
DEU.2.30	But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing to let us cross through his territory because Yahweh your God hardened his spirit and made him obstinate
DEU.2.31	Yahweh said to me, ‘Look! I have begun to give over to you
DEU.2.32	Then Sihon and all his people came out to meet us for battle at Jahaz. 
DEU.2.33	And so Yahweh our God gave him over to us,
DEU.2.34	So we captured all of his cities at that time, and we destroyed each town of males and the women and the children; we did not leave behind a survivor. 
DEU.2.35	We took only the livestock as spoil for ourselves,
DEU.2.36	From Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi
DEU.2.37	Only the land of the Ammonites
DEU.3.1	 “Then we turned, and we went up the road to Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us, he and all of his army for the battle at Edrei. 
DEU.3.2	And Yahweh said to me, ‘You should not fear him, for I have given him and all of his army
DEU.3.3	And so Yahweh our God also gave Og the king of Bashan, and all of his army
DEU.3.4	And we captured all of his towns
DEU.3.5	All of these were fortified towns with high walls, gates, and bars,
DEU.3.6	And so we destroyed them just as we had done to Sihon the king of Heshbon; we destroyed utterly each town of males, the women, and the little children. 
DEU.3.7	But all of the livestock and the booty of the towns we kept as spoil for ourselves.
DEU.3.8	“And so we took at that time the land from the control of
DEU.3.9	(The Sidonians called Hermon ‘Sirion,’ and the Amorites called it ‘Senir.’) 
DEU.3.10	All of the towns of the plateau and the whole of Gilead and all of Bashan up to Salecah and Edrei, the towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
DEU.3.11	(For only Og, king of Bashan, was left from the remnant of the Rephaim. Indeed, his bedstead—it was a bedstead of iron. It is in Rabbah of the Ammonites.
DEU.3.12	And so we took possession of this land at that time, from Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi
DEU.3.13	And the remainder of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the whole region of Argo. All of that area of Bashan was called the land of the Rephaim. 
DEU.3.14	Jair the descendant
DEU.3.15	And also I gave Gilead to Makir. 
DEU.3.16	And to the Reubenites
DEU.3.17	And the Jordan Valley
DEU.3.18	“And I charged you all at that time when I said, “Yahweh has given you—to all of you—this land to possess. All the warriors
DEU.3.19	Only your wives and your little children and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock)
DEU.3.20	until Yahweh shall give rest to your brothers as he did to you, and also they take possession of the land that Yahweh your God is giving to them beyond the Jordan; then they may return, each one to his possession that I have given to them. 
DEU.3.21	And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes see all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings; so Yahweh will do to all of the kingdoms where you are about to cross over to. 
DEU.3.22	You shall not fear them, for Yahweh your God is the one fighting for you. 
DEU.3.23	“And I pleaded with Yahweh at that time, saying, 
DEU.3.24	‘Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your strong hand, for what
DEU.3.25	Let me cross over, please, and let me see the good land that is beyond the Jordan,
DEU.3.26	But Yahweh was very angry with me because of you, and he would not listen to me, and Yahweh said, ‘Enough of that from you!
DEU.3.27	Go up to the top of Pisgah and look around you
DEU.3.28	Now instruct Joshua and support him and encourage him because he himself
DEU.3.29	So we remained in the valley opposite Beth Peor. 
DEU.4.1	“Now, Israel, listen to the rules and to the regulations that I am teaching you to do, in order that you may live and you may go in and you may take possession of the land that Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,
DEU.4.2	You must not add to the word that I am commanding you, and you shall not take away from it in order to keep
DEU.4.3	Your eyes have seen
DEU.4.4	But you, the ones holding fast to Yahweh your God, are all alive today.
DEU.4.5	See, I now teach
DEU.4.6	And you must observe them diligently,
DEU.4.7	For what great nation has for it a god near to it as Yahweh our God, whenever
DEU.4.8	And what other great nation has for it
DEU.4.9	“However, take care
DEU.4.10	Remember the day that you stood before
DEU.4.11	And so you came near, and you stood under the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire up to the heart of the heaven, dark with a very thick cloud.
DEU.4.12	And Yahweh spoke to you from the midst of the fire; you heard
DEU.4.13	And he declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments,
DEU.4.14	And Yahweh charged me at that time to teach you rules and regulations for your observation of them
DEU.4.15	“So you must be very careful for yourselves,
DEU.4.16	so that you do not ruin yourselves
DEU.4.17	a replica of any animal that is upon the earth, a replica of any winged bird that flies in the air, 
DEU.4.18	a replica of any creeping thing on the ground, a replica of any fish that is in the water below
DEU.4.19	And do this so that you do not lift
DEU.4.20	But Yahweh has taken you and brought you out from the furnace of iron, from Egypt, to be a people of inheritance to
DEU.4.21	“And Yahweh was angry with me because of you,
DEU.4.22	For I am going to die in this land; I am not going to cross the Jordan, but you are going to cross, and you are going to take possession of this good land. 
DEU.4.23	Watch out for yourselves so that you do not forget the covenant of Yahweh your God that he had made
DEU.4.24	for Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous
DEU.4.25	“When you have had children and grandchildren
DEU.4.26	I call
DEU.4.27	And Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number
DEU.4.28	And you will there serve gods made by human hands,
DEU.4.29	But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God and will find him, if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul.
DEU.4.30	In your distress
DEU.4.31	For Yahweh your God is a compassionate God; he will not abandon you,
DEU.4.32	“Yes, ask, please, about former days that preceded you
DEU.4.33	Has a people ever heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, just as you heard it, and lived? 
DEU.4.34	Or has a god ever attempted to go to take for himself
DEU.4.35	You yourselves
DEU.4.36	From heaven he made you hear his voice to teach you, and on the earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from the midst of the fire. 
DEU.4.37	And because he loved your ancestors
DEU.4.38	to drive out nations greater and more numerous than you from before you,
DEU.4.39	So you shall acknowledge today,
DEU.4.40	And you shall keep his rules and his commandments that I am commanding you today,
DEU.4.41	Then Moses set apart three cities on the other side of the Jordan,
DEU.4.42	in order for a manslayer
DEU.4.43	He set apart Bezer in the wilderness
DEU.4.44	Now this is the law
DEU.4.45	these are the legal provisions and the rules and the regulations that Moses spoke to the Israelites
DEU.4.46	beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth Peor in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites,
DEU.4.47	And so they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites
DEU.4.48	from Aroer, which is on the bank of the wadi
DEU.4.49	and all of the Arabah
DEU.5.1	And then Moses summoned all of Israel and said to them, “Hear, Israel, the rules and the regulations that I am speaking in your ears today,
DEU.5.2	Yahweh our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. 
DEU.5.3	It was not with our ancestors
DEU.5.4	Face to face
DEU.5.5	I was standing between Yahweh and you
DEU.5.6	‘I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery. 
DEU.5.7	There shall not be for you other gods besides me.
DEU.5.8	‘You shall not make for yourself a divine image of any type of form that is in the heaven above or that is on the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth. 
DEU.5.9	‘You shall not bow down to them, and you shall not serve them, for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God, punishing the guilt of fathers upon their children and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of those hating me, 
DEU.5.10	but showing loyal love to thousands of those who love me and of those who keep my commandments. 
DEU.5.11	‘You shall not take up the name of Yahweh your God for a worthless purpose, for Yahweh will not leave unpunished anyone who uses his name for a worthless purpose. 
DEU.5.12	‘Observe the Sabbath day
DEU.5.13	Six days you shall work, and you shall do all of your work, 
DEU.5.14	but the seventh day is a Sabbath unto Yahweh your God; you shall not do any work, or your son, or your daughter, or your slave, or your slave woman, or your ox, or your donkey, or any of your domestic animals, or your resident alien who is in your towns,
DEU.5.15	And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God brought you out with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm; therefore, Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath.
DEU.5.16	‘Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you, so that it will be good for you
DEU.5.17	‘You shall not murder. 
DEU.5.18	‘And you shall not commit adultery. 
DEU.5.19	‘And you shall not steal. 
DEU.5.20	‘And you shall not falsely bear evidence against your neighbor. 
DEU.5.21	‘And you shall not covet the wife of your neighbor, and you shall not crave the house of your neighbor, his field or his slave or his slave woman or his ox and his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.’
DEU.5.22	“These words Yahweh spoke to your whole assembly at the mountain from the midst of the fire and the very thick cloud with a loud voice, and he did not add anything,
DEU.5.23	And then
DEU.5.24	you said, ‘Look, Yahweh our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire; this day we have seen
DEU.5.25	And so then why shall we die, for this great fire will consume us if we continue
DEU.5.26	For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire as we have heard it and remained alive?
DEU.5.27	You go near and hear everything
DEU.5.28	“And Yahweh heard the sound of your words when you spoke to me,
DEU.5.29	If only
DEU.5.30	Go! Say to them, “Return to your tents.” 
DEU.5.31	But you stand here with me, and let me tell you all of the commandments and the rules and the regulations that you shall teach them, so that they may do them in the land that I am giving to them to take possession of it.’ 
DEU.5.32	“So you must be careful to do just as Yahweh your God commanded you; you shall not turn to the right or to the left. 
DEU.5.33	In exactly the path
DEU.6.1	“Now this is the commandment, the rules and the regulations, that Yahweh your God charged to teach to you for you to observe
DEU.6.2	so that you may revere Yahweh your God by keeping all his statutes and his commandments that I am commanding you, you and your children and grandchildren,
DEU.6.3	And you shall hear, Israel, and be careful to observe these instructions, so that it may go well for you
DEU.6.4	“Hear, Israel, Yahweh our God, Yahweh is unique.
DEU.6.5	And you shall love Yahweh your God with all of your heart
DEU.6.6	And these words that I am commanding you today
DEU.6.7	And you shall recite them to your children, and you shall talk about them at the time of your living in your house and at the time of your going on the road and at the time of your lying down and at the time of your rising up. 
DEU.6.8	And you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as an emblem between your eyes. 
DEU.6.9	And you shall write them on the doorframe of your house and on your gates. 
DEU.6.10	“And then it will happen that when Yahweh your God will bring you to the land that he swore to your ancestors,
DEU.6.11	and houses full of all sorts of good things
DEU.6.12	then take care for yourself, so that you do not forget Yahweh, who brought you out from the land of Egypt from the house of slavery. 
DEU.6.13	“You shall fear Yahweh your God, and you shall serve him, and by his name you shall swear. 
DEU.6.14	You shall not go after other gods from the gods of the peoples who are all around you, 
DEU.6.15	for Yahweh your God is a jealous god in your midst, so that the anger of Yahweh your God would be kindled,
DEU.6.16	You shall not put Yahweh your God to the test, as you tested him at Massah. 
DEU.6.17	You shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God and his legal provisions and his rules that he has commanded you. 
DEU.6.18	And you shall do what is right and good in the eyes of Yahweh, so that it shall go well
DEU.6.19	by driving out all of your enemies before you,
DEU.6.20	“When your child
DEU.6.21	Then you shall say to your child,
DEU.6.22	And Yahweh gave great and awesome signs and wonders in Egypt against Pharaoh and against his entire household in our presence.
DEU.6.23	But he brought us out from there in order to bring us here to give us the land that he swore to our ancestors.
DEU.6.24	And so Yahweh commanded us to observe all of these rules and to revere Yahweh our God for our benefit
DEU.6.25	And it shall be righteousness for us if we diligently observe and do all of this commandment before
DEU.7.1	 “When Yahweh your God brings you into the land that you are about to enter into it
DEU.7.2	and Yahweh your God will give them over to you
DEU.7.3	And you shall not intermarry with them; you shall not give your daughter to their son; and you shall not take his daughter for your son.
DEU.7.4	For their
DEU.7.5	But this is what you must do to them: you shall break down their altars, and their stone pillars you shall smash, and their Asherah poles you shall hew down, and you shall burn their idols with fire. 
DEU.7.6	For you are a holy people for Yahweh your God; Yahweh your God has chosen you to be for him a people, a treasured possession from among all the peoples that are on the face
DEU.7.7	“Yahweh loved you and chose you not because of your great number
DEU.7.8	but
DEU.7.9	So know that Yahweh your God, he is God, the trustworthy God, maintaining his
DEU.7.10	but repaying those
DEU.7.11	And so you shall keep the commandment and the rules and the regulations that I am commanding you today
DEU.7.12	“And then
DEU.7.13	And he will love you, and he will bless you, and he will multiply you, and he will bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your soil, your grain, your wine, and your olive oil, and newborn calves of your cattle, and the newborn lambs
DEU.7.14	You shall be blessed more than all of the peoples; among you there shall not be sterility and bareness, even
DEU.7.15	And Yahweh will turn away from you all the illness and all the harmful diseases of Egypt that you experienced; he will not lay them on you, but he will lay them on all of those who hate you. 
DEU.7.16	And you shall devour all of the peoples that Yahweh your God is giving to you; you shall not pity them,
DEU.7.17	“If you think in your heart, ‘These nations are more numerous than I, so how can I dispossess them?’ 
DEU.7.18	then remember you must not be afraid of them; you must well remember what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh and to all of Egypt: 
DEU.7.19	the great trials that your eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the workings of the strong hand and the outstretched arm by which Yahweh your God brought you out; so Yahweh your God will do to all of the peoples because of whom
DEU.7.20	And, moreover, Yahweh your God will send the hornets
DEU.7.21	You must not be in dread from the presence of them, because Yahweh your God, who is in your midst, is a great and awesome God. 
DEU.7.22	And Yahweh your God will clear away these nations from before you
DEU.7.23	But Yahweh your God will give them to you,
DEU.7.24	And he will give their kings into your hand, and you shall blot out their names
DEU.7.25	You shall burn the images of their gods with fire; you shall not covet the silver or gold that is on them, and so you take it for yourself, so that you are not ensnared by it, for it is a detestable thing to Yahweh your God. 
DEU.7.26	And you must not bring a detestable thing into your house, or you will become a thing devoted to destruction like it; you must utterly detest it, and you must utterly abhor it, for it is an object devoted to destruction. 
DEU.8.1	 “All of the commandments
DEU.8.2	And you shall remember all of the way that Yahweh your God led you during these forty years in the desert in order to humble you and to test you to know what is in your heart, whether you would diligently keep his commandments or not. 
DEU.8.3	And he humbled you and let you go hungry, and then he fed you with that which you did not know nor did your ancestors
DEU.8.4	Your clothing did not wear out on you,
DEU.8.5	And you should know with your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so Yahweh your God is disciplining you.
DEU.8.6	So you must keep the commandments of Yahweh your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him. 
DEU.8.7	For Yahweh your God is bringing you to a good land with streams of water, springs and underground water, welling up in the valleys
DEU.8.8	to a land of wheat and barley and vines
DEU.8.9	to a land where you may eat food in it without scarcity;
DEU.8.10	And you will eat, and you will be satisfied,
DEU.8.11	“Take care for yourself so that you not forget Yahweh your God by not keeping his commandments and his regulations and his statutes that I am commanding you today,
DEU.8.12	lest when you have eaten and you are satisfied and you have built good houses and you live in them, 
DEU.8.13	and your herds and your flocks have multiplied, and you have accumulated silver and gold,
DEU.8.14	then your heart becomes proud
DEU.8.15	the one leading you in the great and terrible desert infested with dangerous
DEU.8.16	the one feeding you
DEU.8.17	And you may think
DEU.8.18	But you must remember Yahweh your God, for he is the one giving you strength to acquire wealth in order to confirm his covenant that he swore to your ancestors
DEU.8.19	And it will happen that if you indeed forget Yahweh your God and you go after other gods and you serve them and you bow down before them, I warn you today that you will surely perish. 
DEU.8.20	As with the nations that Yahweh is destroying before you,
DEU.9.1	 “Hear, Israel, you are about to cross the Jordan today to go to dispossess nations larger and more numerous than you, great cities fortified with high walls,
DEU.9.2	a great and tall people, the sons of the Anakites, whom you know and of whom you have heard it said, ‘Who could stand before the sons of Anak?’ 
DEU.9.3	You should know today
DEU.9.4	“You shall not say to yourself
DEU.9.5	It is not because of your righteousness and because of the uprightness of your heart that you are coming to take possession of their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your God is driving them before you,
DEU.9.6	“So you should understand that it is not because of your righteousness that Yahweh your God is giving you this good land to take possession of it, because you are a stubborn people. 
DEU.9.7	Remember, do not forget,
DEU.9.8	“And remember at Horeb you provoked Yahweh, and Yahweh became angry enough to destroy you. 
DEU.9.9	When I went up the mountain
DEU.9.10	And Yahweh gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them was writing according to all the words that Yahweh spoke with you at the mountain, from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. 
DEU.9.11	And then
DEU.9.12	And Yahweh said to me, ‘Come now, go down quickly from this mountain because your people behave corruptly whom you brought out from Egypt, for they turned quickly from the way that I commanded them to follow; they have made for themselves a cast image.’ 
DEU.9.13	And Yahweh spoke to me, saying,
DEU.9.14	Leave me alone, and let me destroy them, and let me blot out their name from under heaven, and let me make you into a nation mightier and more numerous than they!’ 
DEU.9.15	“And I turned, and I went down the mountain, as the mountain was burning with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. 
DEU.9.16	And I looked,
DEU.9.17	And I took hold of the two tablets, and I threw them out of
DEU.9.18	And then I lay prostrate before
DEU.9.19	For I was in dread
DEU.9.20	And with Aaron Yahweh was angry enough
DEU.9.21	And your sinful thing that you had made, the molten calf, I took and I burned it with fire, and I crushed it, grinding it thoroughly until it was crushed to dust, and I threw its dust into the stream that flowed down the mountain.
DEU.9.22	“And also at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Yahweh to anger. 
DEU.9.23	And when Yahweh sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, saying,
DEU.9.24	You have been rebellious toward Yahweh from the day I have known you.
DEU.9.25	“And I lay prostrate before Yahweh through forty days,
DEU.9.26	And I prayed to Yahweh, and I said, ‘Lord Yahweh, you must not destroy your people and your inheritance whom you redeemed in your greatness,
DEU.9.27	Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; you must not pay attention to
DEU.9.28	lest the people of the land from which you brought us out from there say, “Because Yahweh was not able to bring them to the land that he promised
DEU.9.29	For they are your people and your inheritance whom you brought with your great power and with your outstretched arm.’ 
DEU.10.1	 “At that time Yahweh said to me, ‘Carve for yourself two tablets of stone just as the former ones, and come up the mountain to me, and you shall make for yourself an ark of wood. 
DEU.10.2	And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets, which you smashed, and you must put them in the ark.’ 
DEU.10.3	And so I made an ark of acacia wood,
DEU.10.4	And he wrote upon the tablets according to the first writing,
DEU.10.5	And I turned, and I came down from the mountain, and I put the tablets in the ark that I had made, and they are there, just as Yahweh commanded me. 
DEU.10.6	“And the Israelites
DEU.10.7	From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land flowing with streams of water. 
DEU.10.8	At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to stand before
DEU.10.9	Therefore there was not
DEU.10.10	And I stayed on the mountain just as during the former forty days
DEU.10.11	And Yahweh said to me, ‘Come, continue
DEU.10.12	And now, Israel, what is Yahweh your God asking
DEU.10.13	to keep the commandments of Yahweh and his statutes that I am commanding you today for your own good.
DEU.10.14	Look! For to Yahweh your God belong
DEU.10.15	Yet
DEU.10.16	So you shall circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and do not be stubborn.
DEU.10.17	For Yahweh your God, he is God of the gods and Lord of the lords, the great and mighty God, the awesome one who is not partial,
DEU.10.18	And he executes justice for the orphan and widow, and he is one who loves the alien, to give to them food and clothing. 
DEU.10.19	And you shall love the alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt. 
DEU.10.20	Yahweh your God, you shall revere him, you shall serve him, and to him you shall cling, and by his name you shall swear. 
DEU.10.21	He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done with you these great and awesome things that your eyes have seen. 
DEU.10.22	With only seventy persons your ancestors
DEU.11.1	 “And you shall love Yahweh your God, and you shall keep his obligations and his statutes and his regulations and his commandments always.
DEU.11.2	And you shall realize today
DEU.11.3	and his signs and his deeds that he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to all of his land, 
DEU.11.4	and what he did to the army of Egypt and to their horses and to their chariots, and how he made the water of the Red Sea
DEU.11.5	and what he did to you in the desert until you came up to this place, 
DEU.11.6	and what he did to Dathan and to Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben, how the earth opened its mouth wide and swallowed them, their households and their tents, and all of the living creatures
DEU.11.7	The fact of the matter is, your own eyes have seen
DEU.11.8	“And you must keep all of the commandments
DEU.11.9	so that you may live long
DEU.11.10	For the fact is that the land that you are about to go into
DEU.11.11	But the land that you are about to cross into to take possession of it is a land of hills and valleys, and by the rain of the heaven it drinks water, 
DEU.11.12	a land that Yahweh your God is caring for it; continually the eyes of Yahweh your God are on it, from the beginning of the year up to the end of the year. 
DEU.11.13	“And it will happen that if you listen carefully to my commandments that I am commanding you today,
DEU.11.14	then ‘I will send the rain for your land in its season, early rain and later rain, and you will gather your grain and your wine and your olive oil. 
DEU.11.15	And I will give vegetation in your field for your livestock, and you will eat your fill.’
DEU.11.16	Take care
DEU.11.17	And then the anger of Yahweh will be kindled against you,
DEU.11.18	“And you shall put these, my words, on your heart and on your inner self,
DEU.11.19	And you shall teach them to your children
DEU.11.20	And you shall write them on the doorframes of your house and on your gates, 
DEU.11.21	so that they may multiply your days and the days of your children on the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors
DEU.11.22	Yes, if you diligently keep all
DEU.11.23	then Yahweh will drive out all of these nations before you,
DEU.11.24	Every place on which the sole of your foot treads, it shall be yours; your boundary shall be from the desert and Lebanon from the river, the river Euphrates, on up to the western sea.
DEU.11.25	No one can take a stand against you;
DEU.11.26	“See, I am setting before you
DEU.11.27	the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God that I am commanding you today,
DEU.11.28	and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, but rather you turn from the way that I am commanding you today
DEU.11.29	“And it will happen that when Yahweh your God has brought you to the land that you are going to,
DEU.11.30	(Are they not beyond the Jordan, toward the west,
DEU.11.31	For you are now about to cross the Jordan to go to take possession of the land that Yahweh, your God, is giving to you, and you will take possession of it and live in it, 
DEU.11.32	and you must diligently observe
DEU.12.1	“These are the rules and the regulations that you must diligently observe
DEU.12.2	You must completely demolish all of the places there where they served their gods, that is, the nations whom you are about to dispossess, on the high mountains, and on the hills and under each leafy green tree.
DEU.12.3	And you shall break down their altars, and you shall smash their stone pillars, and their Asherah poles you must burn with fire, and the images of their gods you shall hew down, and you shall blot out their names from that place. 
DEU.12.4	You shall not worship Yahweh your God like this. 
DEU.12.5	But only
DEU.12.6	And you shall bring there your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and your donations
DEU.12.7	And you shall eat there before
DEU.12.8	“You must not do just as we are doing here today,
DEU.12.9	For you have not come up to now to the resting place and to the inheritance that Yahweh your God is giving to you. 
DEU.12.10	But you will cross the Jordan, and you will settle in the land that Yahweh your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give rest to you from all your enemies from all around, and you will live securely, 
DEU.12.11	and then
DEU.12.12	And you shall rejoice before
DEU.12.13	“Take care for yourself so that you do not offer your burnt offerings at just any place that you happen to see, 
DEU.12.14	but only
DEU.12.15	“But whenever you desire
DEU.12.16	Only the blood you must not eat, but on the ground you must pour it like water. 
DEU.12.17	You are not allowed to eat in your towns
DEU.12.18	But only before
DEU.12.19	Take care
DEU.12.20	“When Yahweh your God enlarges your territory just as he has promised
DEU.12.21	If the place that
DEU.12.22	Surely just as the gazelle and the deer is eaten, so both the unclean and the clean together may eat it. 
DEU.12.23	Only, be sure not to eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the meat. 
DEU.12.24	You shall not eat it, but on the ground you shall pour it out like water. 
DEU.12.25	You shall not eat it, so that it will go well
DEU.12.26	Only your holy objects that are yours
DEU.12.27	And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood on the altar of Yahweh your God, and the blood of your sacrifices you shall pour out on the altar of Yahweh your God, but the meat you may eat. 
DEU.12.28	Be careful to obey
DEU.12.29	“When Yahweh your God has cut off the nations whom you are about to go to,
DEU.12.30	take care
DEU.12.31	You must not do so toward Yahweh your God, because of every detestable thing they have done for their gods Yahweh hates, for even their sons and their daughters they would burn in the fire to their gods. 
DEU.12.32	 All of the things
DEU.13.1	 “If a prophet stands up in your midst or a dreamer of dreams
DEU.13.2	and the sign or
DEU.13.3	you must not listen to the words of that prophet or to that dreamer, for Yahweh your God is testing you to know whether you love
DEU.13.4	You shall go after Yahweh your God, and him you shall revere, and his commandment you shall keep, and to his voice you shall listen, and him you shall serve, and to him you shall hold fast. 
DEU.13.5	But that prophet or the dreamer of that dream shall be executed, for he spoke falsely about Yahweh your God, the one bringing you out from the land of Egypt and the one redeeming you from the house of slavery, in order to seduce you from the way that Yahweh your God commanded you to go in it; so in this way you shall purge the evil from your midst. 
DEU.13.6	“If your brother, the son of your mother or your son or your daughter or your wife whom you embrace
DEU.13.7	from among the gods of the people who are around you, those near you or those far from you,
DEU.13.8	you must not give in to him, and you shall not listen to him, and your eye shall not take pity on him, and you shall not have compassion, and you shall not cover up
DEU.13.9	But you shall certainly kill him; your hand shall be first against him to kill him and next the hand of all of the people. 
DEU.13.10	And you shall stone him with stones and let him die, for he tried to seduce you from Yahweh your God, the one bringing you from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery. 
DEU.13.11	And all of Israel shall hear, and they shall fear, and they shall not continue to act
DEU.13.12	“If you hear in one of your towns which Yahweh your God is giving to you to live in, someone saying that
DEU.13.13	worthless men
DEU.13.14	then you shall inquire and examine and interrogate thoroughly, and, look! It is true; the thing has actually been done, this detestable thing in your midst, 
DEU.13.15	then you shall certainly strike down the inhabitants of that town with the edge
DEU.13.16	And then you shall gather all of its booty into the middle of its public square, and you shall burn the town and all of its war-booty totally for Yahweh your God, and it shall be a pile of rubble forever;
DEU.13.17	And let not something cling to your hand from the things devoted to destruction, so that Yahweh may turn back from his burning anger,
DEU.13.18	if you listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep all of his commandments that I am commanding to you today
DEU.14.1	 “You are children
DEU.14.2	For you are a people holy to Yahweh your God, and you Yahweh has chosen to be a treasured possession from among all of the peoples that are on the surface
DEU.14.3	You shall not eat any detestable thing. 
DEU.14.4	These are the animals you may eat: ox, sheep, goats,
DEU.14.5	deer, gazelle, roebuck, wild goat, ibex, antelope, and mountain sheep. 
DEU.14.6	And any animal having a split hoof
DEU.14.7	Only these you may not eat from those chewing the cud
DEU.14.8	And also the pig because it has a division of the hoof
DEU.14.9	“This is what you shall eat from all that is in the water: everything
DEU.14.10	But anything that does not have
DEU.14.11	“All of the birds that are clean you may eat. 
DEU.14.12	Now these are the ones you shall not eat any of them:
DEU.14.13	and the red kite
DEU.14.14	and any kind of crow
DEU.14.15	and the ostrich
DEU.14.16	the little owl and the great owl and the barn owl,
DEU.14.17	and the desert owl
DEU.14.18	and the stork and the heron according to its kind and the hoopoe and the bat. 
DEU.14.19	And also all of the winged insects;
DEU.14.20	You may eat any clean bird. 
DEU.14.21	“You shall not eat any carcass;
DEU.14.22	“Certainly you must give a tithe of all the yield of your seed, which comes forth from your field year after year.
DEU.14.23	And you shall eat before
DEU.14.24	But if the distance is too great for you,
DEU.14.25	then in that case you may exchange for money,
DEU.14.26	You may spend the money for anything that you desire,
DEU.14.27	And as to the Levite who is in your towns,
DEU.14.28	“At the end of three years you shall bring out all of the tithe of your yield for that year, and you shall store it in your towns.
DEU.14.29	And so the Levite may come, because there is no plot of ground for him or an inheritance with you, and the alien also may come and the orphan and the widow that are in your towns,
DEU.15.1	 “At the end of seven years you shall grant a remission of debt. 
DEU.15.2	And this is the manner of the remission of debt: every creditor
DEU.15.3	With respect to the foreigner you may exact payment, but you must remit
DEU.15.4	Nevertheless, there
DEU.15.5	If only you listen well to the voice of Yahweh your God by observing diligently
DEU.15.6	When Yahweh your God has blessed you, just as he promised
DEU.15.7	If there is a poor person among you from among one of your brothers in one of your towns
DEU.15.8	But you shall certainly open your hand for him, and you shall willingly lend
DEU.15.9	Take care
DEU.15.10	By all means you must give to him, and you must not be discontented

DEU.15.14	You shall generously supply him from among your flocks and from your threshing floor and from your press; according to that with which Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall give to him. 
DEU.15.15	And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you; therefore I am commanding you thus today.
DEU.15.16	And then if it will happen that he says to you, ‘I do not want to go out
DEU.15.17	then you shall take an awl, and you shall thrust it through his earlobe and into the door, and he shall be to you a slave forever;
DEU.15.18	It shall not be hard in your eyes when you send him forth free,
DEU.15.19	“Every firstling male that is born of your herd and of your flock you shall consecrate to Yahweh your God; you shall not do work with the firstling of your ox, and you shall not shear the firstling of your flock. 
DEU.15.20	Rather before Yahweh
DEU.15.21	But if there is a physical defect in it, such as lameness or blindness, any serious defect, you shall not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God. 
DEU.15.22	In your towns
DEU.15.23	But you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it on the ground like water.” 
DEU.16.1	 “Observe the month of Abib, and you shall keep the Passover to Yahweh your God, for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you out from Egypt by night. 
DEU.16.2	And you shall offer the Passover sacrifice to Yahweh your God from among your flock and herd at the place that Yahweh will choose, to let his name dwell there. 
DEU.16.3	You shall not eat with it
DEU.16.4	And leaven shall not be seen with
DEU.16.5	You are not allowed to offer the Passover sacrifice in one of your towns
DEU.16.6	but only at the place that Yahweh your God will choose, to let his name dwell there; you shall offer the Passover sacrifice in the evening at sunset,
DEU.16.7	And you shall cook, and you shall eat it at the place that Yahweh your God will choose; and you may turn in the morning and go to your tents. 
DEU.16.8	Six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be an assembly for Yahweh your God; you shall not do work. 
DEU.16.9	“You shall count off seven weeks for you; from the time you begin to harvest the standing grain
DEU.16.10	And then you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks for Yahweh your God with the measure of the freewill offering of your hand that you shall give just as Yahweh your God has blessed you. 
DEU.16.11	And you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you and your son and your daughter and your slave and your slave woman and the Levite that is in your towns
DEU.16.12	And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and so you shall diligently observe
DEU.16.13	“You shall celebrate the Feast of Booths for yourselves
DEU.16.14	and you shall rejoice at your feast, you and your son and your daughter and your slave and your slave woman and the Levite and the orphan and the widow that are in your towns.

DEU.18.11	or one who casts magic spells, or one who consults a spirit of the dead,

DEU.30.20	by loving Yahweh your God by listening to his voice and by clinging to him, for he is your life and the length of your days in order for you to live on the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors,
DEU.31.1	And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. 
DEU.31.2	And he said to them, “I am a hundred and twenty years old today;
DEU.31.3	Yahweh your God is about to cross before you;
DEU.31.4	And Yahweh will do to them just as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and to their land, which he destroyed with them. 
DEU.31.5	And Yahweh will deliver them to you before you,
DEU.31.6	Be strong and be courageous; you should not be afraid, and you should not be in dread from their presence,
DEU.31.7	Then Moses summoned Joshua, and he said to him in the presence of all Israel,
DEU.31.8	Yahweh is the one going before you;
DEU.31.9	So Moses wrote this law, and he gave it to the priests, the descendants
DEU.31.10	Then Moses commanded them, saying,
DEU.31.11	when all Israel comes to appear before
DEU.31.12	Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little children and your aliens that are in your towns,
DEU.31.13	And then their children,
DEU.31.14	Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Look, you are about to die;
DEU.31.15	And Yahweh appeared in the tent in a column of cloud, and the column of the cloud stood at the entrance of the tent. 
DEU.31.16	And Yahweh said to Moses, “Look, you are about to lie down with your ancestors,
DEU.31.17	And my anger shall flare up against them
DEU.31.18	But I will certainly hide my face on that day, because of all of the evil that they
DEU.31.19	“And so then write this song for yourselves and teach it to the Israelites;
DEU.31.20	For when I bring them
DEU.31.21	And then
DEU.31.22	And Moses wrote this song on that day and taught it to the Israelites.
DEU.31.23	Then he
DEU.31.24	And then when Moses finished writing
DEU.31.25	then Moses commanded the Levites carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, saying,
DEU.31.26	“Take the scroll of this law and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and it will be there as a witness against you. 
DEU.31.27	For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck even now while I am still alive with you today,
DEU.31.28	Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officials, so that I may speak in their ears these words, and that I may call as witness against them heaven and earth. 
DEU.31.29	For I know that after my death you will certainly act corruptly, and you will turn aside from the way that I have commanded you, and the disaster in the future days will befall you, because you will do evil
DEU.31.30	So Moses spoke into the ears of the assembly of Israel the words of this song until they were complete.
DEU.32.1	“Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak, 
DEU.32.1	and let the earth hear the words of my mouth. 
DEU.32.2	May my teaching trickle like the dew, 
DEU.32.2	my words like rain showers on tender grass, 
DEU.32.2	and like spring showers on new growth. 
DEU.32.3	For I will proclaim the name of Yahweh; 
DEU.32.3	ascribe greatness to our God! 
DEU.32.4	The Rock, his work is perfect, 
DEU.32.4	for all his ways are just; 
DEU.32.4	he is a faithful God, and without injustice;
DEU.32.4	righteous and upright is he. 
DEU.32.5	They have behaved corruptly toward
DEU.32.5	they are not his children; this is their flaw, 
DEU.32.5	a generation crooked and perverse. 
DEU.32.6	Like this do you treat Yahweh, 
DEU.32.6	foolish and unwise
DEU.32.6	Has he not, your father, created you? 
DEU.32.6	He made you, and he established you. 
DEU.32.7	Remember the old days, the years long past;
DEU.32.7	ask your father, and he will inform you, 
DEU.32.7	your elders and they will tell you.
DEU.32.8	When the Most High apportioned
DEU.32.8	at his dividing up of the sons of humankind, 
DEU.32.8	he fixed the boundaries of the peoples, 
DEU.32.8	according to the number of the children of Israel.
DEU.32.9	For Yahweh’s portion was his people, 
DEU.32.9	Jacob the share of his inheritance. 
DEU.32.10	He found him in a desert land, 
DEU.32.10	and in a howling, desert wasteland; 
DEU.32.10	he encircled him,
DEU.32.10	he protected him like the apple
DEU.32.11	As an eagle stirs up its nest, 
DEU.32.11	hovers over its young, 
DEU.32.11	spreads out its wings, takes them,
DEU.32.11	carries them
DEU.32.12	so Yahweh alone guided him,
DEU.32.12	and there was no foreign god accompanying him.
DEU.32.13	And he set him on the high places of the land, 
DEU.32.13	and he fed him the crops
DEU.32.13	and he nursed him with honey from crags,
DEU.32.13	and with oil from flinty rock, 
DEU.32.14	With curds
DEU.32.14	and with milk from the flock, 
DEU.32.14	with the fat of young rams, 
DEU.32.14	and rams, the offspring of Bashan, 
DEU.32.14	and with goats along with the finest kernels of wheat, 
DEU.32.14	and from the blood of grapes
DEU.32.15	And Jeshurun grew fat, and he kicked; 
DEU.32.15	you grew fat, you bloated, and you became obstinate; 
DEU.32.15	and he abandoned God, his maker, 
DEU.32.15	and he scoffed at the rock of his salvation. 
DEU.32.16	They made him jealous with strange gods; 
DEU.32.16	with detestable things they provoked him. 
DEU.32.17	They sacrificed to the demons, not God, 
DEU.32.17	to gods whom
DEU.32.17	new gods who
DEU.32.17	their ancestors had not known them.
DEU.32.18	The rock who
DEU.32.18	and you forgot God, the one giving you birth. 
DEU.32.19	Then Yahweh saw, and he spurned them, 
DEU.32.19	because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters. 
DEU.32.20	So he said, ‘I will hide my face from them; 
DEU.32.20	I will see what will be their end, 
DEU.32.20	for they are a generation of perversity, 
DEU.32.20	children in whom there is no faithfulness.
DEU.32.21	They annoyed me with what is not a god; 
DEU.32.21	they provoked me with their idols. 
DEU.32.21	So I will make them jealous with those not a people, 
DEU.32.21	with a foolish nation I will provoke them. 
DEU.32.22	For a fire was kindled
DEU.32.22	and it burned up to the depths of Sheol,
DEU.32.22	and it devoured the earth and its produce, 
DEU.32.22	and it set afire the foundation of the mountains. 
DEU.32.23	I will heap disasters upon them; 
DEU.32.23	my arrows I will spend on them. 
DEU.32.24	They will become weakened by famine, 
DEU.32.24	and consumed by plague and bitter pestilence; 
DEU.32.24	and the teeth of wild animals I will send against them, 
DEU.32.24	with the poison of the creeping things in the dust; 
DEU.32.25	From outside her boundaries the sword will make her childless, 
DEU.32.25	and from inside, terror; 
DEU.32.25	both for the young man and also the young woman, 
DEU.32.25	the infant along with the gray-headed man. 
DEU.32.26	I thought, “I will wipe them out; 
DEU.32.26	I will make people forget they ever existed.”
DEU.32.27	If I had not feared a provocation of the enemy, 
DEU.32.27	lest their foes might misunderstand, 
DEU.32.27	lest they should say, 
DEU.32.27	triumphant,
DEU.32.28	For they are a nation void of sense,
DEU.32.28	and there is not any understanding in them. 
DEU.32.29	If only they were wise, they would understand this; 
DEU.32.29	they would discern for themselves their end.
DEU.32.30	How could one chase a thousand 
DEU.32.30	and two could cause a myriad to flee, 
DEU.32.30	if their Rock had not sold them, 
DEU.32.30	and Yahweh had not given them up? 
DEU.32.31	For the fact of the matter is, 
DEU.32.31	their rock is not like our Rock, 
DEU.32.31	and our enemies recognize
DEU.32.32	For their vine is from the vine of Sodom, 
DEU.32.32	and from the terraces of Gomorrah; 
DEU.32.32	their grapes are grapes of poison; 
DEU.32.32	their clusters are bitter.
DEU.32.33	Their wine is the poison of snakes, 
DEU.32.33	and the deadly poison of horned vipers. 
DEU.32.34	‘Is not this stored up with me, 
DEU.32.34	sealed in my treasuries?’
DEU.32.35	Vengeance belongs to me
DEU.32.35	for at the time their foot slips,
DEU.32.35	because the day of their disaster is near, 
DEU.32.35	and fate comes quickly for them.’
DEU.32.36	For Yahweh will judge on behalf of his people, 
DEU.32.36	and concerning his servants; 
DEU.32.36	he will change his mind when he sees that their power has disappeared, 
DEU.32.36	and there is no one left, confined
DEU.32.37	And he will say, ‘Where are their gods, 
DEU.32.37	their rock in whom
DEU.32.38	Who ate the fat of their sacrifices 
DEU.32.38	and drank the wine of their libations? 
DEU.32.38	Let them rise up, and let them help you; 
DEU.32.38	Let them be to you a refuge.
DEU.32.39	See, now, that I, even I am he, 
DEU.32.39	and there is not a god besides me; 
DEU.32.39	I put to death and I give life; 
DEU.32.39	I wound and I heal; 
DEU.32.39	there is not one who delivers from my hand! 
DEU.32.40	For indeed I lift up my hand to heaven, 
DEU.32.40	And I promise as I live forever,
DEU.32.41	When I sharpen
DEU.32.41	and my hand takes hold
DEU.32.41	I will take reprisals against my foes,
DEU.32.41	and my haters I will repay. 
DEU.32.42	I will make my arrows drunk with blood, 
DEU.32.42	and my sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain, 
DEU.32.42	and captives
DEU.32.43	Call for songs of joy, O nations, concerning his people,
DEU.32.43	for the blood of his servants he will avenge, 
DEU.32.43	and he will take reprisals against his foes,
DEU.32.43	and he will make atonement for his land, his people.” 
DEU.32.44	And Moses came, and he spoke
DEU.32.45	And when Moses finished speaking
DEU.32.46	then he said to them, “Take to heart all the words
DEU.32.47	for it is not a trifling matter among you, but it is your life, and through this word you will live long in the land
DEU.32.48	And Yahweh said to Moses on exactly this day, saying,
DEU.32.49	“Go up to this mountain of the Abarim range, Mount Nebo, which is opposite Jericho,
DEU.32.50	You shall die on that mountain that you are about to go up there, and you will be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor
DEU.32.51	because of the fact that you broke faith with me in the midst of Israel at the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the desert of Zin, because you did not treat me as holy
DEU.32.52	Yes, from afar you may view the land, but there you shall not enter there, that is, into the land that I am giving to the Israelites.”
DEU.33.1	Now
DEU.33.2	Then
DEU.33.2	“Yahweh came from Sinai, 
DEU.33.2	and he dawned upon them from Seir; 
DEU.33.2	he shone forth from Mount Paran, 
DEU.33.2	and he came with myriads of holy ones, 
DEU.33.2	at his right hand a fiery law for them.
DEU.33.3	Moreover,
DEU.33.3	all the holy ones were in your hand, 
DEU.33.3	and they bowed down to
DEU.33.3	each one accepted directions from you.
DEU.33.4	A law Moses instructed for us, 
DEU.33.4	as a possession for the assembly of Jacob. 
DEU.33.5	And then a king arose in Jeshurun, 
DEU.33.5	at the gathering of the leaders of the people, 
DEU.33.5	united were the tribes of Israel.
DEU.33.6	“May Reuben live, and may he not die, 
DEU.33.6	and let his number not be few.”
DEU.33.7	And he said this of Judah,
DEU.33.7	“Hear, O Yahweh, the voice of Judah, 
DEU.33.7	and bring him to his people; 
DEU.33.7	his own hands strive
DEU.33.7	and may you be a help against
DEU.33.8	And of Levi he said, 
DEU.33.8	“Your Thummim and your Urim 
DEU.33.8	are for your faithful one,
DEU.33.8	whom you tested at Massah;
DEU.33.8	you contended with him 
DEU.33.8	at the waters of Meribah. 
DEU.33.9	The one saying of his father and of his mother, 
DEU.33.9	‘I have not regarded them,’ 
DEU.33.9	and his brothers he did not acknowledge, 
DEU.33.9	and his children
DEU.33.9	but rather they observed your word, 
DEU.33.9	and your covenant they kept. 
DEU.33.10	They taught
DEU.33.10	and your law to Israel; 
DEU.33.10	they placed incense smoke before you,
DEU.33.10	and whole burnt offerings on your altar. 
DEU.33.11	Bless, O Yahweh, his substance, 
DEU.33.11	and with the work of his hands you must be pleased; 
DEU.33.11	smite the loins of those who attack him, 
DEU.33.11	and those hating him, so that they cannot arise.”
DEU.33.12	Of Benjamin he said, 
DEU.33.12	“The beloved of Yahweh dwells securely,
DEU.33.12	the Most High
DEU.33.12	all the day, 
DEU.33.12	and between his shoulders he dwells.” 
DEU.33.13	And of Joseph he said, 
DEU.33.13	“Blessed by Yahweh is his land, 
DEU.33.13	with
DEU.33.13	with
DEU.33.14	and with
DEU.33.14	and with the choice things of the yield of the seasons,
DEU.33.15	and with
DEU.33.15	and with
DEU.33.16	and with
DEU.33.16	and the favor of the one who dwelt
DEU.33.16	Let them come to the head of Joseph, 
DEU.33.16	and to the crown of the prince among his brothers. 
DEU.33.17	As the firstborn of his ox, majesty belongs to him,
DEU.33.17	and his horns are the horns of a wild ox; 
DEU.33.17	with them he drives people together,
DEU.33.17	and they are the myriads of Ephraim, 
DEU.33.17	and they are the thousands of Manasseh.” 
DEU.33.18	And of Zebulun he said, 
DEU.33.18	“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, 
DEU.33.18	and rejoice, Issachar, in your tents; 
DEU.33.19	They summon people to the mountains;
DEU.33.19	there they sacrifice the sacrifices of righteousness, 
DEU.33.19	because the affluence of the seas they suck out, 
DEU.33.19	and the most hidden treasures of the sand.”
DEU.33.20	And of Gad he said, 
DEU.33.20	“Blessed be the one who enlarges Gad;
DEU.33.20	like a lion he dwells, 
DEU.33.20	and he tears an arm as well as a scalp. 
DEU.33.21	And he selected
DEU.33.21	for there the portion of a ruler is included, 
DEU.33.21	and he came with the heads of the people;
DEU.33.21	he did
DEU.33.21	and his regulations for Israel.” 
DEU.33.22	And of Dan he said, 
DEU.33.22	“Dan is a cub of a lion; 
DEU.33.22	he leaps from Bashan.”
DEU.33.23	And of Naphtali, he said, 
DEU.33.23	“Oh, Naphtali, sated of favor, 
DEU.33.23	and full of the blessing of Yahweh; 
DEU.33.23	take possession of the lake, 
DEU.33.23	and the land to the south.” 
DEU.33.24	And of Asher he said, 
DEU.33.24	“Blessed more than sons
DEU.33.24	may he be the favorite
DEU.33.24	dipping his feet in the oil.
DEU.33.25	Your bars are
DEU.33.25	and as your days, so is
DEU.33.26	“There is no one like God, O, Jeshurun, 
DEU.33.26	who rides through the heavens to your help, 
DEU.33.26	and with his majesty through the skies. 
DEU.33.27	The God of ancient time
DEU.33.27	and underneath are the arms of eternity,
DEU.33.27	and he drove out from before
DEU.33.27	and he said, ‘Destroy them!’ 
DEU.33.28	So Israel dwells alone and carefree, 
DEU.33.28	the spring of Jacob in a land of grain and wine; 
DEU.33.28	his heavens even drip dew. 
DEU.33.29	Blessed are you, O Israel. 
DEU.33.29	Who is like you, a people who is saved by Yahweh, 
DEU.33.29	the shield of your help, 
DEU.33.29	and who is the sword of your triumph, 
DEU.33.29	and your enemies, they shall fawn before you,
DEU.33.29	and you shall tread on their backs.” 
DEU.34.1	Then Moses went up from the desert plateau
DEU.34.2	and all of Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh and all of the land of Judah, up to the western sea,
DEU.34.3	and the Negev and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palms, on up to Zoar. 
DEU.34.4	And Yahweh said to him, “This is the land that I swore to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob, saying,
DEU.34.5	Then Moses, the servant of Yahweh, died there in the land of Moab according to the command of Yahweh.
DEU.34.6	And he
DEU.34.7	Now Moses was a hundred and twenty years old
DEU.34.8	And the Israelites
DEU.34.9	Now
DEU.34.10	And not again
DEU.34.11	as far as all the signs and the wonders Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt, against
DEU.34.12	and as far as all of the mighty deeds
JOS.1.1	After the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh, Yahweh said to Joshua son of Nun, the assistant
JOS.1.2	“My servant Moses is dead. Get up and cross the Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the Israelites.
JOS.1.3	Every place that the soles of your feet will tread, I have given it to you, as I promised
JOS.1.4	From the wilderness and the Lebanon,
JOS.1.5	No one will stand before you
JOS.1.6	Be strong and courageous, for you will give the people this land as an inheritance that I swore to their ancestors
JOS.1.7	Only be strong and very courageous to observe diligently the whole law
JOS.1.8	The scroll of this law will not depart from your mouth; you will meditate on it day and night so that you may observe diligently all that is written
JOS.1.9	Did I not command you? Be strong and courageous! Do not fear or be dismayed, for Yahweh your God is with you wherever you go.”
JOS.1.10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 
JOS.1.11	“Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people: ‘Prepare your provisions;
JOS.1.12	To the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said, 
JOS.1.13	“Remember the word that Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded you, saying, ‘Yahweh your God is giving rest to you, and he is giving
JOS.1.14	Your wives, your little children, and your livestock, they will remain in the land that Moses gave to you beyond the Jordan. All of the best fighting men
JOS.1.15	until Yahweh gives rest to your families as well as to you. They will take possession of the land that Yahweh your God is giving to them. Then you will return to your own land and take possession of it, the land that Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan to the east.”
JOS.1.16	And they answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you will send us we will go. 
JOS.1.17	Just as we obeyed Moses, so will we obey you. Only may Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses. 
JOS.1.18	Whoever rebels against your orders
JOS.2.1	Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two men from Acacia Grove
JOS.2.2	The king of Jericho was told, “Look, some men from the Israelites
JOS.2.3	And the king of Jericho sent for Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who came to you, the ones who have entered your house, for they have come to search out the whole land.” 
JOS.2.4	But the woman took the two men and hid them. And she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from. 
JOS.2.5	And when it was time to shut the gate for the night,
JOS.2.6	(But she had taken them to the roof and had hidden them in the stalks of flax
JOS.2.7	So the men chased after them on the way to the Jordan
JOS.2.8	Before they went to sleep,
JOS.2.9	and said to the men, “I know that Yahweh has given you the land, and that dread of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away in fear because of your presence. 
JOS.2.10	For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the waters of the Red Sea
JOS.2.11	We heard this, and our hearts
JOS.2.12	So then please swear to me by Yahweh, because I have shown loyalty to you,
JOS.2.13	and you will spare my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all that belongs to them; you will deliver our lives from death.” 
JOS.2.14	And the men said to her, “Our lives for yours.
JOS.2.15	Then she lowered them with a rope through the window, as her house was on the outer side of the wall, and she was residing in the wall. 
JOS.2.16	And she said to them, “Go to the mountain, so that the pursuers will not find you, and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers return, and afterward you may go on your way.”
JOS.2.17	The men said to her, “We will be released from this oath of yours that you made us swear. 
JOS.2.18	When we come to the land, you must tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and you must gather your father and mother, and your brothers, and your whole family to your house. 
JOS.2.19	If anyone goes outside the doors of your house, they will be responsible for their own death,
JOS.2.20	But if you report this business of ours, we will be released from your oath that you made us swear.” 
JOS.2.21	And she said, “According to your word it will be.” Then she sent them away, and they went, and she tied the scarlet cord in the window. 
JOS.2.22	They departed and came to the mountain, and they stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers searched all along the way
JOS.2.23	The two men returned and went down from the mountain, and they crossed over and came to Joshua son of Nun, and they told him everything that happened to them. 
JOS.2.24	They said to Joshua, “Surely Yahweh has given all the land into our hand; also, all the inhabitants of the land melt away in fear because of our presence.” 
JOS.3.1	Joshua rose early in the morning, and they set out from Acacia Grove.
JOS.3.2	At the end of the three days the officers passed through the midst of the camp, 
JOS.3.3	and they commanded the people: “When you see the Levitical priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God you must set out from your place and go after it. 
JOS.3.4	But there will be a distance between you and it of about two thousand cubits in measurement.
JOS.3.5	And Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves, because tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders in your midst.” 
JOS.3.6	And Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people.”
JOS.3.7	Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “This day I will begin exalting you in the sight
JOS.3.8	You will command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘At the moment that you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you will stand still in the Jordan.’ ” 
JOS.3.9	And Joshua said to the Israelites,
JOS.3.10	Joshua said, “By this you will know that the living God is in your midst, and he will certainly drive out the Canaanites from before you,
JOS.3.11	Look! The ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth
JOS.3.12	So then, take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.
JOS.3.13	When the soles of the feet of the priests carrying the ark of Yahweh, Lord of all the earth,
JOS.3.14	And it happened, when the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant were ahead of the people.
JOS.3.15	When those carrying the ark came up to the Jordan, and the priests carrying the ark dipped their feet in the edge of the water (the Jordan was flowing over its banks during all the days of harvest), 
JOS.3.16	the waters flowing down from above stood still; they stood up in one heap very far from Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, while the waters flowing down to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea,
JOS.3.17	And the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh stood firmly on the dry land in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel crossed on dry ground, until all the nation finished crossing the Jordan. 
JOS.4.1	After all the nation finished crossing the Jordan, Yahweh said to Joshua, 
JOS.4.2	“Take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe,
JOS.4.3	and command them, saying, ‘Take for yourselves twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan where the priests’ feet stood firmly, and bring them over with you, and set them up in the place where you will camp tonight.’ ”
JOS.4.4	So Joshua summoned the twelve men whom he had appointed from the Israelites,
JOS.4.5	And Joshua said to them, “Cross over before
JOS.4.6	so that this may be a reminder
JOS.4.7	you will say to them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off from before
JOS.4.8	Thus the Israelites
JOS.4.9	Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests carrying the ark of the covenant stood, and they are there to this day. 
JOS.4.10	The priests carrying the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything that Yahweh commanded Joshua to tell the people was finished, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. And the people hastily crossed over. 
JOS.4.11	And it happened, when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of Yahweh and the priests crossed over in front of
JOS.4.12	The children of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the Israelites,
JOS.4.13	About forty thousand armed for fighting crossed over before the presence of Yahweh to the plains of Jericho for battle. 
JOS.4.14	On that day Yahweh exalted Joshua in the sight
JOS.4.15	Then Yahweh said to Joshua, saying, 
JOS.4.16	“Command the priests carrying the ark of the testimony
JOS.4.17	So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.” 
JOS.4.18	And it happened that when the priests carrying the ark came up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet touched dry land,
JOS.4.19	And the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the eastern edge
JOS.4.20	And those twelve stones that they took from the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal. 
JOS.4.21	And he said to the Israelites,
JOS.4.22	you will let your children know by saying, ‘Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.’ 
JOS.4.23	For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you, until you had crossed, just as Yahweh your God did to the Red Sea,
JOS.4.24	so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of Yahweh is strong, so that you may fear Yahweh your God forever.”
JOS.5.1	And it happened, when all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites
JOS.5.2	At that time Yahweh said to Joshua, “Make for yourself knives of flint, and circumcise the Israelites
JOS.5.3	So Joshua made knives of flint, and he circumcised the Israelites
JOS.5.4	This is the reason why Joshua circumcised all the people: all the males who went out from Egypt, all the warriors, died in the wilderness as they went out from Egypt on the journey.
JOS.5.5	For all the people who left were circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness on the journey
JOS.5.6	For forty years the Israelites
JOS.5.7	And it was their children whom he raised in their place that Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the journey.
JOS.5.8	And it happened, when all the nation had finished circumcising, they remained where they were in the camp until they recovered. 
JOS.5.9	And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you.” Therefore, the name of that place is called Gilgal
JOS.5.10	And the Israelites
JOS.5.11	On the next day after the Passover, on that
JOS.5.12	And the manna ceased the day after, when they started eating the produce of the land, and there was no longer manna for the Israelites.
JOS.5.13	And it happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, he looked up,
JOS.5.14	And he said, “Neither. I have come now as the commander of Yahweh’s army.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and he bowed down
JOS.5.15	The commander of Yahweh’s army said to Joshua, “Take off your sandals
JOS.6.1	Now Jericho was shut up inside and out because of the presence of the Israelites;
JOS.6.2	And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Look, I am giving Jericho into your hand, its king and the soldiers of the army. 
JOS.6.3	You will march around the city, all the warriors circling the city once; you will do so for six days. 
JOS.6.4	And seven priests will bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day you will march around the city seven times, and the priests will blow on the trumpets. 
JOS.6.5	And when they blow long on the horn of the ram, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people will shout with a great war cry, and the wall of the city will fall flat,
JOS.6.6	So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry the trumpets of the rams’ horns before the ark of Yahweh.” 
JOS.6.7	And he said
JOS.6.8	And when Joshua spoke
JOS.6.9	And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they were blowing the trumpets. 
JOS.6.10	But Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You will not shout, and you will not let your voice be heard; a word will not go out from your mouth until the day I say to you ‘Shout!’ Then you will shout.” 
JOS.6.11	And the ark of Yahweh went around the city, circling once,
JOS.6.12	Then Joshua got up early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh. 
JOS.6.13	The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of the rams’ horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually, and they blew on the trumpets. And the armed men went before them, and the rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh, while the trumpets blew continually. 
JOS.6.14	And they marched around the city once on the second day, and they returned to the camp. They did this for six days. 
JOS.6.15	Then on the seventh day they rose early at dawn, and they marched around the city in this manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times. 
JOS.6.16	And at the seventh time the priests blew on the trumpets, and Joshua said to the people, “Shout! For Yahweh has given you the city. 
JOS.6.17	The city and all that is in it will be devoted to Yahweh; only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in the house will live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent. 
JOS.6.18	As for you, keep away from the things
JOS.6.19	But all of the silver and gold, and the items of bronze and iron, are holy to Yahweh, and they must go to Yahweh’s treasury.” 
JOS.6.20	So the people shouted, and they
JOS.6.21	And they utterly destroyed by the edge of the sword
JOS.6.22	Then Joshua said to the two men who spied on the land, “Go to the prostitute’s house and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her, just as you swore to her.” 
JOS.6.23	So the young men who were spies went and brought Rahab and her father and mother, her brothers, and all who were with her. And they brought all her family out and set them outside the camp of Israel. 
JOS.6.24	And they burned the city and all that was in it with fire; they put only the silver and gold, and the items of copper and iron, into the treasury of the house of Yahweh. 
JOS.6.25	But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute and her family
JOS.6.26	And Joshua swore at that time, saying, “Cursed is anyone before Yahweh who gets up and builds Jericho, this city. At the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.” 
JOS.6.27	So Yahweh was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land. 
JOS.7.1	But the Israelites
JOS.7.2	Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven, east of Bethel, and he said to them, “Go up and spy out Ai.” And the men went up and spied out Ai. 
JOS.7.3	And they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not let all the people go up and attack Ai; only two or three thousand men should go up because they
JOS.7.4	So about three thousand from the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai. 
JOS.7.5	The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, and they chased them from the gate up to Shebarim and killed them on the slope. And the hearts
JOS.7.6	And Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the ground on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.
JOS.7.7	And Joshua said, “Ah, my Lord! Why did you bring this people across the Jordan to give us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content and stayed beyond the Jordan. 
JOS.7.8	Please, my Lord! What can I say after Israel has fled from its enemies?
JOS.7.9	The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of this, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the land. What will you do, for your great name?” 
JOS.7.10	And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stand up! Why
JOS.7.11	Israel has sinned and transgressed my covenant
JOS.7.12	The Israelites
JOS.7.13	Get up, sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow. Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: “There are devoted things
JOS.7.14	In the morning you will come forward, tribe by tribe,
JOS.7.15	The one caught with the devoted things
JOS.7.16	So
JOS.7.17	And he brought forward the clans of Judah and selected the clan of the Zerahites
JOS.7.18	He brought forward his family, one by one, and Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected by lot. 
JOS.7.19	And Joshua said to Achan, “My son, please, give glory to Yahweh the God of Israel, and give him a doxology in court.
JOS.7.20	And Achan answered Joshua and said, “It is true. I have sinned against Yahweh the God of Israel, and this is what I did: 
JOS.7.21	I saw among the spoil a beautiful robe from Shinar,
JOS.7.22	Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and there they were, hidden in his tent, and the silver was under it. 
JOS.7.23	And they took them from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites.
JOS.7.24	Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his cattle and donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and everything that was his, and they brought them to the valley of Achor.
JOS.7.25	And Joshua said, “Why did you bring us trouble? Yahweh will bring you trouble on this day.” And all Israel stoned them
JOS.7.26	Then they placed
JOS.8.1	Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not fear or be dismayed. Take all the fighting men
JOS.8.2	You will do to Ai and its king that which you did to Jericho and its king; you may take only its spoils
JOS.8.3	So Joshua and all the fighting men
JOS.8.4	And he commanded them, saying, “Look, you are to lay an ambush against the city from behind. Do not go very far from the city and be ready. 
JOS.8.5	Then I and all of the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they go out to meet us as before,
JOS.8.6	They will come out after us until we draw them away from the city, because they will think, ‘They are fleeing from us
JOS.8.7	Then you will rise up from the ambush and take possession of the city, for Yahweh your God will give it into your hand. 
JOS.8.8	And when you capture the city you will set it on fire as Yahweh commanded. Look, I have commanded you.” 
JOS.8.9	So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the place of the ambush, and they sat between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai; but Joshua spent the night with the people.
JOS.8.10	Joshua rose early in the morning and mustered the people, and he went up with the elders of Israel before the people of Ai.
JOS.8.11	All the fighting men
JOS.8.12	And he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. 
JOS.8.13	So they stationed the forces; all the army was north of the city while the rear guard was west.
JOS.8.14	When the king of Ai saw this, the men of the city hurried and rose early and went out to meet Israel for battle—he
JOS.8.15	Then Joshua and all Israel acted like they were beaten before them, and they fled in the direction of the wilderness.
JOS.8.16	All of the people who were in the city were called to pursue after them. As they pursued after Joshua, they were drawn away from the city. 
JOS.8.17	Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel; they left the city open and pursued after Israel. 
JOS.8.18	And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stretch out the sword
JOS.8.19	The moment he stretched out his hand, those in the ambush stood up quickly from their place and ran. And they went into the city and captured it, quickly setting the city ablaze with fire. 
JOS.8.20	Then the men of Ai looked behind them, and they saw smoke from the city rising to the sky; they had no power to flee this way or that,
JOS.8.21	And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city was rising; they returned and struck down the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.22	Then the others from the city came out to meet them, and they found themselves surrounded by Israel,
JOS.8.23	But they captured the king of Ai alive, and they brought him to Joshua. 
JOS.8.24	When Israel finished slaughtering all the inhabitants of Ai in the open field, in the wilderness where they pursued them, and when all of them had fallen by the edge of the sword
JOS.8.25	All the people that fell on that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand—all the inhabitants of Ai. 
JOS.8.26	For Joshua did not draw back his hand that was stretched out with the sword until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 
JOS.8.27	Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty for themselves, according to the word of Yahweh that Joshua commanded. 
JOS.8.28	So Joshua burned Ai and made it an everlasting heap of rubbish, a desolate place until this day. 
JOS.8.29	The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the time of evening, and as the sun went down Joshua commanded them, and they brought down his dead body from the tree. Then they threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and they raised over it a great heap of stones that remains to this day. 
JOS.8.30	Then Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal for Yahweh the God of Israel, 
JOS.8.31	as Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded the Israelites,
JOS.8.32	And there Joshua wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he
JOS.8.33	Then all Israel, foreigner as well as native,
JOS.8.34	And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings
JOS.8.35	There was not a word from all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before the assembly of all Israel, and the women, the little children, and the traveling foreigners
JOS.9.1	Now
JOS.9.2	they gathered themselves together to fight with one accord against
JOS.9.3	But the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua did to Jericho and Ai, 
JOS.9.4	and they acted on their part with cunning: they went and prepared provisions,
JOS.9.5	The sandals on their feet were patched and old, their clothes were old, and their food was dry and crumbled. 
JOS.9.6	And they went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far land; so then make a covenant with us.”
JOS.9.7	And the men of Israel said to the Hivites,
JOS.9.8	They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” And Joshua said to them, “Who are you, and from where do you come?” 
JOS.9.9	And they said to him, “Your servants have come from a very far land because of the name of Yahweh your God; we have heard of his reputation, of all that he did in Egypt, 
JOS.9.10	and of all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan—to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth. 
JOS.9.11	So our elders said to us and all the inhabitants of our land, ‘Take in your hand provisions for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, “We are your servants; so then make a covenant with us.” ’
JOS.9.12	This is our bread; it was hot when we took it from our houses as provisions on the day we set out to come to you. But now, look, it is dry and crumbled. 
JOS.9.13	These are the wineskins that we filled new, but look, they have burst; and these are our clothes and sandals that have worn out from the very long journey.” 
JOS.9.14	So the leaders
JOS.9.15	And Joshua made peace with them, and he made a covenant with them
JOS.9.16	And it happened that at the end of three days, after they made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors
JOS.9.17	And the Israelites
JOS.9.18	But the Israelites
JOS.9.19	But all the leaders of the congregation said, “We have sworn to them by Yahweh the God of Israel, and so we cannot touch them. 
JOS.9.20	This we will do to them: we will let them live so that wrath will not be on us because of the oath we swore to them.” 
JOS.9.21	And the leaders
JOS.9.22	And Joshua summoned them and said, “Why have you deceived us saying, ‘We are very far from you’ when you are living among us? 
JOS.9.23	Therefore you are cursed; some of you will always be slaves as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.” 
JOS.9.24	And they answered Joshua and said, “Because it was told with certainty to your servants that Yahweh your God commanded Moses his servant to give to you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you, so we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and so we did this thing. 
JOS.9.25	So then, look, we are in your hand; do with us whatever seems good and right in your eyes.” 
JOS.9.26	So he did this to them: he saved them from the hand of the Israelites,
JOS.9.27	And that day Joshua made them woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day, in the place that he should choose. 
JOS.10.1	And it happened that when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua captured Ai and had utterly destroyed it (just as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he did to Ai and its king) and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them, 
JOS.10.2	he
JOS.10.3	So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hohman king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying, 
JOS.10.4	“Come up and help me, and let us attack Gibeon, because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.”
JOS.10.5	And the five kings of the Amorites,
JOS.10.6	And the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Do not abandon
JOS.10.7	So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the fighting men
JOS.10.8	And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for I have given them into your hand; no one will withstand you.
JOS.10.9	Joshua came upon them suddenly by marching up
JOS.10.10	And Yahweh threw them into panic before Israel, who
JOS.10.11	And as they were fleeing from Israel, they were on the slope of Beth-horon, and Yahweh threw huge stones from the heavens on them as far as Azekah; and more died by the hail stones than those whom the Israelites
JOS.10.12	Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh, on the day Yahweh gave the Amorites
JOS.10.12	“Sun in Gibeon, stand still, 
JOS.10.12	and moon, in the valley of Aijalon.” 
JOS.10.13	And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, 
JOS.10.13	until the nation took vengeance on its enemies. 
JOS.10.13	Is it not written in the scroll of Jashar? The sun stood still in the middle of the heaven and was not in haste to set for about a full day. 
JOS.10.14	There has not been a day like this before it or after, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man; for Yahweh fought for Israel. 
JOS.10.15	And Joshua returned and all Israel with him to the camp at Gilgal. 
JOS.10.16	But these five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	And it was told to Joshua, saying, “The five kings were found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.” 
JOS.10.18	And Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men in front of it to guard them. 
JOS.10.19	But do not stay there; pursue after your enemies and attack them from the rear. Do not allow them to go into their cities, for Yahweh your God has given them into your hand.” 
JOS.10.20	When Joshua and the Israelites
JOS.10.21	and all the people returned to the camp safely
JOS.10.22	And Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring to me those five kings from the cave.” 
JOS.10.23	And they did so, and brought him these five kings from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. 
JOS.10.24	And when they brought these kings to Joshua, Joshua called all the men of Israel and said to the commanders of the fighting men
JOS.10.25	And Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid or dismayed! Be strong and bold, for thus Yahweh will do to all your enemies whom you are about to fight. 
JOS.10.26	And after this Joshua struck them down and killed them, and he hanged them on five trees. And they were hanging on the trees until the evening. 
JOS.10.27	And it happened at the time of sunset,
JOS.10.28	Joshua captured Makkedah on that day, and he struck it and its king with the edge of the sword;
JOS.10.29	And Joshua passed on, and all of Israel with him, from Makkedah to Libnah, and he fought against Libnah. 
JOS.10.30	And Yahweh also gave it into the hand of Israel, and its king and all the people in it he struck with the edge of the sword.
JOS.10.31	And Joshua passed on, and all of Israel with him, from Libnah to Lachish, and he laid siege to it
JOS.10.32	And Yahweh gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day. He struck it with the edge of the sword,
JOS.10.33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish, and Joshua struck him and his people until he left no survivor behind. 
JOS.10.34	And Joshua passed on, and all of Israel with him, from Lachish to Eglon, and they laid siege to it
JOS.10.35	And they captured it on that day, and he struck it with the edge of the sword,
JOS.10.36	And Joshua went up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought against it 
JOS.10.37	and captured it, and they struck it with the edge of the sword,
JOS.10.38	Then Joshua returned to Debir, and all of Israel with him, and they fought against it, 
JOS.10.39	and he captured it and its king and all its cities, and they struck them with the the edge of the sword,
JOS.10.40	So Joshua struck all the land—the hill country, the Negev,
JOS.10.41	Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza, and all the land of Goshen up to Gibeon; 
JOS.10.42	all of these kings and their land Joshua captured at one time, because Yahweh the God of Israel fought for Israel. 
JOS.10.43	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal. 
JOS.11.1	And it happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard this, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Acshaph, 
JOS.11.2	and to the kings who were in the north in the hill country, in the Arabah
JOS.11.3	to the Canaanites
JOS.11.4	They came out, they and all their armies with them, as a great army like the sand on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots. 
JOS.11.5	And all these kings joined forces, and they came and camped together by the waters of Merom to fight with Israel. 
JOS.11.6	And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid because of their presence, for tomorrow at this time I will hand them over slain to Israel; you will hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.” 
JOS.11.7	So Joshua, and all the fighting men
JOS.11.8	And Yahweh gave them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them and pursued them up to Great Sidon and Misrephoth Maim, and eastward up to the valley of Mizpeh. And they struck them until they left behind no survivor. 
JOS.11.9	And Joshua did to them as Yahweh commanded him; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire. 
JOS.11.10	Then Joshua turned back at that time, and he captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword, because Hazor formerly was the head of all these kingdoms. 
JOS.11.11	He struck all the people that were in it with the edge of the sword,
JOS.11.12	And Joshua captured all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, and he utterly destroyed them with the edge of the sword,
JOS.11.13	Israel did not burn the cities standing on their mounds,
JOS.11.14	And all the spoil and livestock of these cities the Israelites took as booty; they struck the people with the edge of the sword,
JOS.11.15	Just as Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua did; he left nothing undone that Yahweh had commanded Moses. 
JOS.11.16	So Joshua took all this land: the hill country, all the Negev,
JOS.11.17	from Mount Halak that rises to Seir and to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon
JOS.11.18	For many days Joshua made war with all these kings. 
JOS.11.19	There was not a city that made peace with the Israelites
JOS.11.20	For it was Yahweh that hardened their hearts,
JOS.11.21	At that time Joshua came and exterminated the Anakites from the hill country, from Hebron, Debir, Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities. 
JOS.11.22	None of the Anakites were left in the land of the Israelites;
JOS.11.23	Joshua took all the land according to all that Yahweh had spoken to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel, according to their tribal divisions, and the land rested from war. 
JOS.12.1	These are the kings of the land whom the Israelites
JOS.12.2	Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi
JOS.12.3	and the Arabah
JOS.12.4	the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the last of the Rephaites, who lived at Ashtaroth and Edrei 
JOS.12.5	and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and over all Bashan up to the border of the Geshurites
JOS.12.6	Moses Yahweh’s servant and the Israelites
JOS.12.7	These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the Israelites
JOS.12.8	in the hill country, the Shephelah,
JOS.12.9	the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one; 
JOS.12.10	the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 
JOS.12.11	the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 
JOS.12.12	the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 
JOS.12.13	the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 
JOS.12.14	the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; 
JOS.12.15	the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 
JOS.12.16	the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; 
JOS.12.17	the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 
JOS.12.18	the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one; 
JOS.12.19	the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; 
JOS.12.20	the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Acshaph, one; 
JOS.12.21	the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 
JOS.12.22	the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one; 
JOS.12.23	the king of Dor in Naphath Dor, one; the king of Goiim for Gilgal, one; 
JOS.12.24	the king of Tirzah, one; all the kings, thirty-one. 
JOS.13.1	Now Joshua was old and advanced in years,
JOS.13.2	This is the remaining land: all the regions of the Philistines, and all of the Geshurites,
JOS.13.3	from the Shihor, which is east of Egypt,
JOS.13.4	In the south; all the land of the Canaanites,
JOS.13.5	and the land of the Gebalites, and all the Lebanon,
JOS.13.6	all the inhabitants of the hill country, from the Lebanon
JOS.13.7	Therefore, divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.” 
JOS.13.8	With it
JOS.13.9	from Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi
JOS.13.10	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites,
JOS.13.11	and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurite
JOS.13.12	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei—he was left over from the survivors
JOS.13.13	But the Israelites
JOS.13.14	Only the tribe of Levites
JOS.13.15	Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the descendants
JOS.13.16	Their territory was from Aroer, which was on the edge of the wadi
JOS.13.17	Heshbon and its cities that are on the plateau; Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon, 
JOS.13.18	Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 
JOS.13.19	Kiriathaim, Sibmah, and Zereth Shahar on the hill of the valley; 
JOS.13.20	Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth; 
JOS.13.21	all of the cities of the plateau, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites,
JOS.13.22	In addition to their slain, the Israelites
JOS.13.23	And the border of the descendants
JOS.13.24	Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, to the descendants
JOS.13.25	Their territory was Jazer and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites
JOS.13.26	and from Heshbon up to Ramah-Mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim up to the territory to Debir; 
JOS.13.27	in the valley of Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth, Zaphon, and the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan and its banks,
JOS.13.28	This is the inheritance of the Gadites
JOS.13.29	Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh; it was for the half-tribe of the descendants
JOS.13.30	Their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the settlements
JOS.13.31	and half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth, Edrei, and the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan; these were allotted to the children of Makir son of Manasseh, for half of the children of Makir according to their families. 
JOS.13.32	These are the territories that Moses gave as an inheritance on the desert-plateau of Moab, beyond the Jordan, east of Jericho. 
JOS.13.33	But to the tribe of Levi Moses did not give an inheritance; Yahweh the God of Israel, he is their inheritance, just as he promised them.
JOS.14.1	These are the territories that the Israelites
JOS.14.2	Their inheritance was by lot, just as Yahweh commanded through the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe. 
JOS.14.3	For Moses had given an inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan, but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them. 
JOS.14.4	For the descendants
JOS.14.5	Just as Yahweh commanded Moses, so the Israelites
JOS.14.6	Then the descendants
JOS.14.7	I was forty years old
JOS.14.8	My companions who went up with me made the hearts
JOS.14.9	And Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land that your foot has trodden on will be an inheritance to you and your sons forever, because you remained true to Yahweh my God.’ 
JOS.14.10	So then, look, Yahweh has kept me alive just as he promised these forty-five years,
JOS.14.11	Today I am still strong, just as on the day that Moses sent me; as my strength was then, so now also is my strength for war and for daily activities.
JOS.14.12	So now give me this hill country that Yahweh spoke of on that day, for you heard on that day that the Anakites were there, with great and fortified cities. Perhaps Yahweh is with me, and I will drive them out just as Yahweh promised.”
JOS.14.13	And Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb son of Jephunneh as an inheritance. 
JOS.14.14	Thus Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he remained true to Yahweh the God of Israel. 
JOS.14.15	And the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath Arba;
JOS.15.1	The allotment for the tribe of the descendants
JOS.15.2	Their southern border was from the end of the Salt Sea,
JOS.15.3	it continues
JOS.15.4	it passes on
JOS.15.5	The eastern border is the Salt Sea
JOS.15.6	the border goes up to Beth-hoglah and passes along north of Beth Arabah; and the border goes up the stone of Bohan son of Reuben; 
JOS.15.7	and the border goes up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and to the north, turning to Gilgal, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is south of the wadi;
JOS.15.8	Then the border goes up by the Valley of Ben Hinnom
JOS.15.9	then the border turns from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and continues
JOS.15.10	and the border goes around from Baalah to the west, to Mount Seir, and passes on to the slope of Mount Jearim from the north (that is, Kesalon), and goes down to Beth Shemesh, and passes along by Timnah. 
JOS.15.11	The border continues
JOS.15.12	And the western border is to the Great Sea
JOS.15.13	According to the commandment of Yahweh to Joshua,
JOS.15.14	Caleb drove out from there three of Anak’s sons, Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the descendants
JOS.15.15	And from there he went up against the inhabitants of Debir (the former name of Debir was Kiriath Sepher). 
JOS.15.16	And Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kiriath Sepher and captures it, I will give to him my daughter Acsah as a wife.” 
JOS.15.17	Othniel son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it, and he gave to him Acsah his daughter as a wife. 
JOS.15.18	When she came to him she urged him to ask her father for a field. So she dismounted from the donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you want?”
JOS.15.19	And she said to him, “Give to me a gift;

JOS.15.63	But the descendants
JOS.16.1	The allotment of the descendants
JOS.16.2	it continues from Bethel to Luz, and it passes along to the territory of the Arkites
JOS.16.3	Then it goes down, to the west, to the territory of the Japhletites,
JOS.16.4	And the descendants
JOS.16.5	This was the border of the descendants
JOS.16.6	The border continues to the sea; from Micmethath to the north, the border turns to the east to Taanath Shiloh, and it passes along it from the east to Janoah. 
JOS.16.7	Then it goes down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah; it touches Jericho and ends at the Jordan; 
JOS.16.8	from Tappuah the border goes to the west, to the wadi
JOS.16.9	with the cities that were set apart for the descendants
JOS.16.10	But they did not drive out the Canananites
JOS.17.1	Then the allotment was made for the tribe of Manasseh, because he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Makir, the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted
JOS.17.2	An allotment was made for the remaining descendants
JOS.17.3	But Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Makir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
JOS.17.4	They came before Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders, saying, “Yahweh commanded Moses to give an inheritance to us among our kinsmen.”
JOS.17.5	Thus ten shares fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan, 
JOS.17.6	because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead was allotted to the remaining descendants
JOS.17.7	The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Micmethath, which is opposite Shechem;
JOS.17.8	The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh,
JOS.17.9	Then the border goes down to the wadi
JOS.17.10	The south is Ephraim’s, and the north is Manasseh’s; the sea is their
JOS.17.11	In Issachar and Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its villages, Ibleam and its villages, the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, the inhabitants of En-dor and its villages, the inhabitants of Taanach and its villages, the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; the third is Napheth. 
JOS.17.12	But the descendants
JOS.17.13	And it happened, when the Israelites
JOS.17.14	The descendants
JOS.17.15	And Joshua said to them, “If you are many people, go up to the forest and clear a place there for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites
JOS.17.16	And the descendants
JOS.17.17	And Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, “You are many people and have great power; you will not have one allotment only; 
JOS.17.18	the hill country will be yours. Even though it is a forest, you will clear it, and it will be yours to its farthest borders. You will drive out the Canaanites,
JOS.18.1	The entire congregation of the Israelites
JOS.18.2	And seven tribes remained among the Israelites
JOS.18.3	And Joshua said to the Israelites,
JOS.18.4	Provide three men from each tribe,
JOS.18.5	They will divide it among themselves into seven portions; Judah will maintain its border
JOS.18.6	Describe the land in seven divisions, and bring it to me here; I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh our God. 
JOS.18.7	The Levites among you have no portion, for their inheritance is the priesthood of Yahweh; Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh received their inheritance beyond the Jordan to the east, which Moses Yahweh’s servant gave to them.” 
JOS.18.8	And the men went immediately,
JOS.18.9	And the men went and passed through the land, and they described
JOS.18.10	and Joshua cast a lot for them at Shiloh before
JOS.18.11	And the allotment of the tribe of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the border of their allotment fell
JOS.18.12	Their northern border began at the Jordan and went up to the slope of Jericho on the north and continued into the hill country to the west; it ends
JOS.18.13	The border passes on from there to Luz, to the slope of Luz to the south (that is, Bethel); then the border goes down to Ataroth Addar to the mountain that is south of Lower Beth-Horon. 
JOS.18.14	Then the border changes direction and turns to the western side southward, from the mountain that is opposite
JOS.18.15	The southern side begins on the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim, and the border continues to the west to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah; 
JOS.18.16	the border goes down to the foot
JOS.18.17	It changes direction from the north, and it continues to En Shemesh; it goes out to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and it goes down to the stone of Bohan, son of Reuben. 
JOS.18.18	It passes on to the slope opposite the Arabah
JOS.18.19	The border passes on to the slope of Beth-hoglah to the north and ends
JOS.18.20	The Jordan forms its border on the eastern side. This is the inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin, its borders that surrounds them, according to their families.

JOS.19.48	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants
JOS.19.49	They finished assigning the land according to its borders, and the Israelites
JOS.19.50	According to the commandment of Yahweh,
JOS.19.51	These are the inheritances that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families of the tribes, distributed by allotment to the Israelites,
JOS.20.1	And Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying, 
JOS.20.2	“Speak to the Israelites,
JOS.20.3	Anyone who kills a person by accident or unintentionally
JOS.20.4	The killer will flee to one of these cities, stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and state his case to the elders of that city;
JOS.20.5	And if the avenger of blood pursues after him, they will not hand over the killer into his hand, because he killed his neighbor unintentionally, and he did not hate him previously.
JOS.20.6	The killer will stay in that city until he stands before the congregation for the trial, until the death of the one who is the high priest in those days. Then the killer will return
JOS.20.7	So they set apart
JOS.20.8	Beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they appointed Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau, from the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in the Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh. 
JOS.20.9	These were the cities designated for all the Israelites,
JOS.21.1	Then the heads of the families of the Levites came to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the families of the tribes of the Israelites.
JOS.21.2	And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, “Yahweh commanded through the hand of Moses to give us cities to live in, with their pasturelands for our livestock.” 
JOS.21.3	So, by command of Yahweh,
JOS.21.4	The allotment fell
JOS.21.5	The remaining descendants
JOS.21.6	The descendants
JOS.21.7	The descendants
JOS.21.8	The Israelites
JOS.21.9	They gave these cities, which are here mentioned by name, from the tribe of the families of Judah and from the tribe of the families of Simeon; 
JOS.21.10	and they were for the descendants
JOS.21.11	And they gave to them Kiriath Arba,
JOS.21.12	But the field of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his property.

JOS.21.40	All these were the cities of the descendants
JOS.21.41	All the cities of the Levites among the property of the Israelites
JOS.21.42	Each of these cities had pasturelands surrounding them; so it was for all of these cities. 
JOS.21.43	And Yahweh gave to Israel all the land that he swore to give to their ancestors,
JOS.21.44	Yahweh gave them rest on every side, according to all that he had sworn to their ancestors,
JOS.21.45	And nothing failed from
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, 
JOS.22.2	and he said to them, “You have observed all that Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded you, and you have listened
JOS.22.3	you have not forsaken your kinsmen
JOS.22.4	So then, Yahweh your God has given rest to your kinsmen,
JOS.22.5	Only be very careful to observe the commandment and law that Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded you, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commandments, to hold fast to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.”
JOS.22.6	And Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents. 
JOS.22.7	And to the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua had given a possession with their kinsmen
JOS.22.8	he said to them, “Return to your tents with much wealth, and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, copper, iron, and with very much clothing; divide the war-booty of your enemies with your kinsmen.”
JOS.22.9	So the descendants
JOS.22.10	And they came to the region of the Jordan that is in the land of Canaan, and the descendants
JOS.22.11	And the Israelites
JOS.22.12	When the Israelites
JOS.22.13	And the Israelites
JOS.22.14	and ten leaders with him, one leader for each
JOS.22.15	They came to the descendants
JOS.22.16	“Thus says all the congregation of Yahweh: ‘What is this treachery that you have committed against the God of Israel by turning away today from following Yahweh, by building for yourselves an altar to rebel today against Yahweh? 
JOS.22.17	Is not the sin of Peor enough for us,
JOS.22.18	that you must turn today from following Yahweh? If you rebel today against Yahweh, tomorrow he will be angry with all of the congregation of Israel; 
JOS.22.19	if, however, the land of your property is unclean, cross over to the land of Yahweh’s property, where Yahweh’s tabernacle resides,
JOS.22.20	Did not Achan son of Zerah commit treachery with devoted things,
JOS.22.21	And the descendants
JOS.22.22	“Yahweh, God of gods! Yahweh, God of gods knows. And let Israel itself know, if it was in rebellion or treachery against Yahweh, do not spare us this day 
JOS.22.23	for building for ourselves an altar to turn away from Yahweh, or if it was to offer burnt offerings,
JOS.22.24	But in fact, we have done this because of anxiety, because of a reason, saying, ‘In the future your children may say to our children, ‘What is the relationship between you and Yahweh the God of Israel?
JOS.22.25	Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you, the descendants
JOS.22.26	So we said, ‘Let us build immediately for ourselves an altar, not for burnt offerings
JOS.22.27	instead, it is a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us for performing the serving of Yahweh in his presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fellowship offerings; so that your children may not say in the future to our children, “You have no portion in Yahweh.” ’ 
JOS.22.28	And we thought, if they say to us and to our children in the future, we can say, ‘Look at this replica of the altar of Yahweh, which our ancestors
JOS.22.29	Far be it from us to rebel against Yahweh, to turn today from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt offerings,
JOS.22.30	Phinehas the priest, the leaders of the congregation, and the heads of the clans
JOS.22.31	Phinehas the priest, son of Eleazar, said to the descendants
JOS.22.32	And Phinehas the priest, son of Eleazar, and the leaders returned from the descendants
JOS.22.33	The report satisfied the Israelites;
JOS.22.34	The descendants
JOS.23.1	And it happened, after a long time,
JOS.23.2	Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders, heads, judges, and officials, and he said to them, “I am old and well-advanced in years,
JOS.23.3	and you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all these nations for your sake,
JOS.23.4	Look! I have allotted to you these remaining nations as an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, to the Great Sea
JOS.23.5	And Yahweh your God will push them back before you
JOS.23.6	Be very strong to observe carefully all that is written in the scroll of the law of Moses so as not to turn aside from it, to the right or left, 
JOS.23.7	so as not to go among these remaining nations with you; do not profess
JOS.23.8	But hold fast to Yahweh your God, just as you have done up to this day. 
JOS.23.9	Yahweh has driven out before you great and strong nations; and as for you, nobody has withstood
JOS.23.10	One of your men put to flight a thousand, for Yahweh your God is fighting for you, just as he promised you. 
JOS.23.11	Take utmost care for the sake of your life to love Yahweh your God, 
JOS.23.12	for if indeed you turn back and join these remaining nations among you,
JOS.23.13	know for certain that Yahweh your God will not continue to drive out
JOS.23.14	Look! I am about to die,
JOS.23.15	But just as all the good things
JOS.23.16	If you transgress the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he commanded to you, and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them, Yahweh’s anger will be kindled
JOS.24.1	And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem; he summoned the elders of Israel, their heads, their judges, and their officials, and they presented themselves before God. 
JOS.24.2	And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: ‘Long ago
JOS.24.3	I took your ancestor
JOS.24.4	and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. 
JOS.24.5	And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought you out. 
JOS.24.6	When I brought out your ancestors
JOS.24.7	They cried out to Yahweh, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea over them
JOS.24.8	And I brought you to the land of the Amorites
JOS.24.9	Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, set out and fought against Israel, and he sent and summoned Balaam son of Beor to curse you, 
JOS.24.10	but I was not willing to listen to Balaam, and he richly blessed you. So I rescued you from his hand, 
JOS.24.11	and you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the citizens of Jericho, the Amorites,
JOS.24.12	I sent before you the hornet and they drove out before you two kings of the Amorites;
JOS.24.13	I gave to you a land that you have not labored on, and cities that you have not built, and you live
JOS.24.14	“So now, revere Yahweh and serve him in sincerity and faithfulness; remove the gods that your ancestors
JOS.24.15	But if it is bad in your eyes to serve Yahweh, choose for yourselves today whom you want to serve, whether it is the gods that your ancestors
JOS.24.16	And the people answered and said, “Far be it from us that we would forsake Yahweh to serve other gods, 
JOS.24.17	for Yahweh our God brought us and our ancestors
JOS.24.18	And Yahweh drove out all the people before us, the Amorites
JOS.24.19	But Joshua said to the people, “You cannot serve Yahweh, for he is a holy and jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins. 
JOS.24.20	If you forsake Yahweh and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster to you; he will destroy you after he has done good to you.” 
JOS.24.21	And the people said to Joshua, “No, we will serve Yahweh.” 
JOS.24.22	And Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves to serve Yahweh.” And they said, “We are witnesses.” 
JOS.24.23	He said, “Remove the foreign gods that are in your midst, and incline your hearts to Yahweh the God of Israel.” 
JOS.24.24	And the people said to Joshua, “We will serve Yahweh our God, and we will listen to his voice.” 
JOS.24.25	So Joshua made a covenant
JOS.24.26	Then Joshua wrote these words in a scroll of the law of God, and he took a large stone and set it up there under a large tree, which is at the shrine of Yahweh. 
JOS.24.27	And Joshua said to all the people, “Look, this stone will be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of Yahweh that he spoke with us. It will be as a witness against you, so that you do not deny your God.” 
JOS.24.28	Then Joshua sent the people away to their inheritance. 
JOS.24.29	After these things Joshua son of Nun servant of Yahweh died; he was one hundred and ten years old.
JOS.24.30	They buried him in the territory of his inheritance, at Timnath-Serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 
JOS.24.31	Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who lived long after Joshua, and who had known all the work that Yahweh did for Israel.
JOS.24.32	The bones of Jacob, which the Israelites
JOS.24.33	And Eleazar son of Aaron died; and they buried him in Gibeah in the hill country of Ephraim, which had been given to his son Phinehas. 
JDG.1.1	After the death of Joshua, the Israelites
JDG.1.2	And Yahweh said, “Judah will go up. I hereby give the land into his hand.” 
JDG.1.3	And Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Go up with me into my allotment, and let us fight against the Canaanites; then I too will go with you into your allotment.” And Simeon went with him. 
JDG.1.4	And Judah went up, and Yahweh gave the Canaanites
JDG.1.5	At Bezek they came upon Adoni-bezek, and they fought against him and defeated the Canaanites
JDG.1.6	And Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued after him; they caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
JDG.1.7	Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes
JDG.1.8	The descendants
JDG.1.9	Afterward the descendants
JDG.1.10	And Judah went against the Canaanites
JDG.1.11	And from there they went to the inhabitants of Debir (the former name of Debir was Kiriath Sepher). 
JDG.1.12	And Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kiriath Sepher and captures it, I will give to him Acsah my daughter as a wife.” 
JDG.1.13	Othniel son of Kenaz, the younger brother of Caleb, captured it, and he gave to him Acsah his daughter as a wife. 
JDG.1.14	When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. As she dismounted from the donkey, Caleb said to her, “What do you want?”
JDG.1.15	And she said to him, “Give me a gift;
JDG.1.16	The descendants
JDG.1.17	And Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they defeated the Canaanites
JDG.1.18	Judah captured Gaza and its territory, Ashkelon and its territory, and Ekron and its territory. 
JDG.1.19	And Yahweh was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they had chariots of iron. 
JDG.1.20	They gave Hebron to Caleb just as Moses said, and he drove out the three sons of Anak from there. 
JDG.1.21	But the descendants
JDG.1.22	Likewise, the house of Joseph went up against Bethel, and Yahweh was with them. 
JDG.1.23	And the house of Joseph spied out Bethel (the former name of the city was Luz). 
JDG.1.24	And when the spies saw a man leaving the city,
JDG.1.25	So he showed them the entrance of the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword,
JDG.1.26	And the man went to the land of the Hittites, and he built a city and named it Luz; this is its name to this day. 
JDG.1.27	Manasseh did not drive out Beth-Sean and its towns, or Taanach and its towns, or the inhabitants
JDG.1.28	And it happened, when Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites
JDG.1.29	Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites
JDG.1.30	Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or Nahalol, so the Canaanites
JDG.1.31	Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob, 
JDG.1.32	so the Asherites
JDG.1.33	Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or Beth-anath, but lived in the midst of the Canaanites,
JDG.1.34	The Amorites pressed
JDG.1.35	the Amorites were determined to live in Har-heres,
JDG.1.36	The border of the Amorites
JDG.2.1	And the angel of Yahweh went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, “I brought you up from Egypt, and I brought you to the land that I had promised to your ancestors.
JDG.2.2	And as for you, do not make a covenant
JDG.2.3	Now I say, I will not drive them out from before you; they will become as thorns
JDG.2.4	And as the angel of Yahweh spoke these words to all the Israelites,
JDG.2.5	And they called the name of this place Bokim,
JDG.2.6	And Joshua sent the people away, and the Israelites
JDG.2.7	And the people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who saw all the great work Yahweh had done for Israel. 
JDG.2.8	And Joshua son of Nun, servant of Yahweh, died at the age of one hundred and ten years.
JDG.2.9	They buried him within the border of his inheritance in Timnah-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. 
JDG.2.10	Moreover, that entire generation was gathered to their
JDG.2.11	The Israelites
JDG.2.12	They abandoned Yahweh the God of their ancestors,
JDG.2.13	They abandoned Yahweh, and they served Baal and the Ashtaroth. 
JDG.2.14	So the anger of Yahweh was kindled
JDG.2.15	Whenever
JDG.2.16	Then Yahweh raised up leaders,
JDG.2.17	But they did not listen to their leaders,
JDG.2.18	And when Yahweh raised leaders
JDG.2.19	But when the leader
JDG.2.20	So the anger of Yahweh burned
JDG.2.21	I will not again drive out anyone from before them from the nations that Joshua left when he died, 
JDG.2.22	in order to test Israel whether or not they would observe the way of Yahweh, to walk in it just as their ancestors
JDG.2.23	So Yahweh left those nations; he did not drive them out at once, and he did not give them into the hand of Joshua. 
JDG.3.1	These are the nations that Yahweh left, to test Israel by them (that is, to test all those who had not experienced
JDG.3.2	in order that the generations of Israel would know war, to teach those who had not experienced it
JDG.3.3	the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites,
JDG.3.4	They were left for testing Israel, to know whether they would keep the commands of Yahweh that he commanded their ancestors
JDG.3.5	And the Israelites
JDG.3.6	And they took their daughters as wives for themselves, and they gave their daughters to their sons, and they served their gods.
JDG.3.7	The Israelites
JDG.3.8	And the anger of Yahweh was kindled
JDG.3.9	The Israelites
JDG.3.10	And the spirit of Yahweh came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and Yahweh gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into his hand, and he prevailed over
JDG.3.11	So the land rested forty years. Then Othniel son of Kenaz died. 
JDG.3.12	And again the Israelites
JDG.3.13	He gathered to himself the Ammonites and Amalekites,
JDG.3.14	And the Israelites
JDG.3.15	And the Israelites
JDG.3.16	Ehud made for himself a short, two-edged
JDG.3.17	Then he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. 
JDG.3.18	When Ehud
JDG.3.19	But he turned back from the sculptured stones
JDG.3.20	and Ehud came to him while he was sitting alone in his cool upper room. And Ehud said, “I have a message from God
JDG.3.21	Then Ehud reached with his left hand for the sword on his right thigh, and he thrust it into his
JDG.3.22	And the handle also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade because he did not draw back the sword from his stomach; and it went protruding out the back.
JDG.3.23	And Ehud went out the vestibule, and he closed the doors of the upper room and locked them behind him. 
JDG.3.24	After he left, his servants returned. When they saw that the doors of the upper room were locked, they thought,
JDG.3.25	And they waited so long they became embarrassed because he did not open the doors of the upper room. So they took the key and opened the doors, and there their lord was lying on the ground dead. 
JDG.3.26	And Ehud escaped while they delayed. He passed by the sculptured stones
JDG.3.27	And when he arrived he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites
JDG.3.28	And he said to them, “Follow after me! Yahweh has given Moab your enemies into your hand.” So they went down after him, and they captured the fords of the Jordan toward Moab; and they did not allow anyone to cross over. 
JDG.3.29	And they struck Moab at that time, about ten thousand men, all strong and able men;
JDG.3.30	And Moab was subdued on that day under the hand of Israel. And the land rested eighty years.
JDG.3.31	And Shamgar son of Anath came after him, and he killed six hundred Philistines with the goad of an ox; he also delivered Israel. 
JDG.4.1	And again the Israelites
JDG.4.2	So Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, and he was living in Harosheth Haggoyim. 
JDG.4.3	And the Israelites
JDG.4.4	Now at that time Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging
JDG.4.5	And she used to sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites
JDG.4.6	She sent and called for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh Naphtali and said to him, “Has not Yahweh the God of Israel commanded you? ‘Go, march to
JDG.4.7	I will draw out
JDG.4.8	Barak said to her, “If you go with me, I will go; but if you do not go with me, I will not go.” 
JDG.4.9	She said, “Surely I will go with you; however, there will be no glory for you in the path you are taking,
JDG.4.10	Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and they went up behind him,
JDG.4.11	And Heber the Kenite was separated from the other Kenites,
JDG.4.12	When they
JDG.4.13	Sisera summoned all his chariots—all nine hundred chariots
JDG.4.14	And Deborah said to Barak, “Get up! This is the day that Yahweh has given Sisera into your hand. Has Yahweh not gone out before you?” So Barak went out from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him. 
JDG.4.15	And Yahweh threw Sisera and all his chariots and army into confusion
JDG.4.16	But Barak pursued after the chariots
JDG.4.17	Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
JDG.4.18	And Jael came out to meet Sisera, and she said to him, “Turn aside, my lord; turn aside to me and do not be afraid.” So he turned aside into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.
JDG.4.19	And he said to her, “Please, give me a drink of water, because I am thirsty.” So she opened a skin vessel of milk and gave him a drink and covered him. 
JDG.4.20	And he said to her, “Stand at the doorway of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks you, and says, ‘Is there anyone here?’ You must answer, ‘No.’ ” 
JDG.4.21	But Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, took in her hand a tent peg and a hammer, and she went softly
JDG.4.22	And behold, Barak was pursuing Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him, and she said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” And he came with her and saw that Sisera was lying dead with the peg in his temple. 
JDG.4.23	On that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites.
JDG.4.24	And the hand of the Israelites
JDG.5.1	And Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang on that day: 
JDG.5.2	“When long hair hangs loosely in Israel, 
JDG.5.2	when the people willingly offer themselves, 
JDG.5.2	bless Yahweh! 
JDG.5.3	Hear, O kings! Give ear, O princes! 
JDG.5.3	I will sing to Yahweh; 
JDG.5.3	I will sing praise to Yahweh, 
JDG.5.3	the God of Israel. 
JDG.5.4	Yahweh, when you went down from Seir, 
JDG.5.4	when you marched from the region of Edom, 
JDG.5.4	the earth trembled, the heavens poured down, 
JDG.5.4	the clouds poured down water. 
JDG.5.5	The mountains trembled
JDG.5.5	this Sinai, at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
JDG.5.6	“In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, 
JDG.5.6	in the days of Jael, the caravans had ceased, 
JDG.5.6	the travelers,
JDG.5.7	The warriors
JDG.5.7	they failed to appear in Israel, 
JDG.5.7	until I,
JDG.5.7	I
JDG.5.8	God chose new leaders,
JDG.5.8	then war was at the gates; 
JDG.5.8	a small shield or a spear was not seen 
JDG.5.8	among forty thousand in Israel. 
JDG.5.9	My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel, 
JDG.5.9	those offering themselves willingly among the people; 
JDG.5.9	bless Yahweh! 
JDG.5.10	The riders of white female donkeys, 
JDG.5.10	those sitting on saddle blankets, 
JDG.5.10	and those going on the way, talk about it! 
JDG.5.11	At the sound of those dividing
JDG.5.11	among the watering places, 
JDG.5.11	there they will recount the righteous deeds of Yahweh, 
JDG.5.11	the righteous deeds for his warriors
JDG.5.11	Then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates. 
JDG.5.12	“Wake up, wake up, Deborah! 
JDG.5.12	Wake up, wake up, sing a song! 
JDG.5.12	Get up, Barak! 
JDG.5.12	Take captive your captives, O son of Abinoam. 
JDG.5.13	Then the remnant went down to the nobles; 
JDG.5.13	the people of Yahweh went down for him
JDG.5.14	From Ephraim is their root into Amalek, 
JDG.5.14	after you, Benjamin, with your family; 
JDG.5.14	from Makir the commanders went down, 
JDG.5.14	and from Zebulun those carrying the scepter 
JDG.5.14	of the military commander. 
JDG.5.15	And the chiefs
JDG.5.15	and Issachar likewise was with Barak; 
JDG.5.15	into the valley he was sent to get him from behind.
JDG.5.15	Among the clans of Reuben 
JDG.5.15	were great decisions of the heart.
JDG.5.16	Why do you sit among the sheepfolds, 
JDG.5.16	to hear the calling sounds of the herds? 
JDG.5.16	For the clans of Reuben, 
JDG.5.16	there were great searchings of the heart. 
JDG.5.17	Gilead has remained
JDG.5.17	Why did Dan dwell as a foreigner with ships? 
JDG.5.17	Asher sat at the coast of the waters, 
JDG.5.17	and by his coves he has been settling down. 
JDG.5.18	Zebulun is a people who scorned death, 
JDG.5.18	and Naphtali, on the heights of the field. 
JDG.5.19	“The kings came, they fought; 
JDG.5.19	then the kings of Canaan fought; 
JDG.5.19	at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, 
JDG.5.19	they got no plunder in silver. 
JDG.5.20	The stars fought from heaven; 
JDG.5.20	from their courses they fought against Sisera. 
JDG.5.21	The wadi
JDG.5.21	the raging wadi torrent, 
JDG.5.21	the wadi torrent of Kishon. 
JDG.5.21	March on, my soul, with strength! 
JDG.5.22	“Then the hooves of the horse beat loudly, 
JDG.5.22	because of galloping, galloping of his stallions. 
JDG.5.23	‘Curse Meroz,’ says the angel of Yahweh; 
JDG.5.23	‘curse bitterly its inhabitants, 
JDG.5.23	because they did not come to the help of Yahweh, 
JDG.5.23	to the help of Yahweh against the mighty.’ 
JDG.5.24	“Most blessed of women is Jael, 
JDG.5.24	the wife of Heber the Kenite; 
JDG.5.24	most blessed is she of women among tent dwellers. 
JDG.5.25	He asked for water, and she gave milk; 
JDG.5.25	in a drinking bowl for nobles, she brought curds. 
JDG.5.26	She reached out her hand to the peg, 
JDG.5.26	and her right hand for the workman’s hammer; 
JDG.5.26	and she struck Sisera, crushed his head, 
JDG.5.26	and she shattered and pierced his temple. 
JDG.5.27	Between her feet he sank, he fell, he lay. 
JDG.5.27	Between her feet he sank down, he fell; 
JDG.5.27	Where he sank down, there he fell—dead.
JDG.5.28	“Through the window she looked down; 
JDG.5.28	the mother of Sisera cried out through the lattice, 
JDG.5.28	‘Why is his chariot delayed in coming? 
JDG.5.28	Why do the hoof beats
JDG.5.29	The wisest of her ladies answer her; 
JDG.5.29	she also answers the question herself: 
JDG.5.30	‘Are they not finding and dividing the plunder? 
JDG.5.30	A bedmate or two bedmates for every man;
JDG.5.30	colorful garments for Sisera, 
JDG.5.30	plunder of colorful garments,
JDG.5.30	beautifully finished colorful garments, 
JDG.5.30	on the neck of the plunderer?’ 
JDG.5.31	So may all your enemies perish, O Yahweh, 
JDG.5.31	but those who love him are like the rising sun at its brightest.” 
JDG.5.31	And the land had rest for forty years. 
JDG.6.1	The Israelites
JDG.6.2	The hand of the Midianites
JDG.6.3	And whenever Israel sowed seed, the Midianites,
JDG.6.4	They would camp against them and destroy the produce of the land as far as
JDG.6.5	For they, their livestock, and their tents would come up like a great number of locusts; they and their camels could not be counted; they came into the land and devoured it. 
JDG.6.6	Israel was very poor because of the presence of the Midianites,
JDG.6.7	When the Israelites
JDG.6.8	Yahweh sent a prophet to the Israelites,
JDG.6.9	I delivered you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of all your oppressors, and drove them out from before you;
JDG.6.10	And I said to you, ‘I am Yahweh your God; do not fear
JDG.6.11	The angel of Yahweh came and sat under the oak
JDG.6.12	The angel of Yahweh appeared to him and said to him, “Yahweh is with you, you mighty warrior.”
JDG.6.13	Gideon said to him, “Excuse me, my lord. If Yahweh is with us, why then has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonderful deeds that our ancestors
JDG.6.14	And Yahweh turned to him and said, “Go in this your strength, and you will deliver Israel from the palm of Midian. Did I not send you?” 
JDG.6.15	He said to him, “Excuse me, my lord. How will I deliver Israel? Look, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father’s house.” 
JDG.6.16	And Yahweh said to him, “But I will be with you, and you will defeat Midian as if they are one man.”
JDG.6.17	And he
JDG.6.18	Please, do not depart from here until I come back to you and bring out my gift and set it out before you.”
JDG.6.19	And Gideon went and prepared a young goat
JDG.6.20	The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes and put them on this rock; pour the broth over it.” And he did so. 
JDG.6.21	Then the angel of Yahweh reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand, and he touched the meat and the unleavened cakes; and fire went up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of Yahweh went from his sight.
JDG.6.22	And Gideon realized that he was the angel of Yahweh; and Gideon said, “Oh, my lord Yahweh! For now I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face.” 
JDG.6.23	And Yahweh said to him, “Peace be with you. Do not fear; you will not die.” 
JDG.6.24	And Gideon built there an altar to Yahweh, and he called it “Yahweh is peace.” To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
JDG.6.25	Now on that same night Yahweh said to him, “Take the bull of the cattle that belongs to your father, and a second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father, and cut down the Asherah
JDG.6.26	and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold in the proper arrangement, and take a second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah
JDG.6.27	Gideon took ten men from his servants, and he did just as Yahweh told him;
JDG.6.28	When the men of the city got up early in the morning, look, the altar of Baal and the Asherah
JDG.6.29	And they said to one another,
JDG.6.30	And the men of the city said to Jehoash, “Bring out your son so that he may die, for he has pulled down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah that was beside it.” 
JDG.6.31	But Jehoash said to all who stood against him,
JDG.6.32	Thus, on that day he
JDG.6.33	Then all the Midianites,
JDG.6.34	So the Spirit of Yahweh took possession of
JDG.6.35	He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they were also called to follow him; and he sent messengers throughout Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them. 
JDG.6.36	Then Gideon said to God, “In order to see that you will deliver Israel by my hand, just as you have said, 
JDG.6.37	I will place a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and all of the ground is dry, I will know that you will deliver Israel by my hand, just as you have said.” 
JDG.6.38	And it was so. He arose early the next day and squeezed the fleece, and he wrung out dew from the fleece, a full drinking bowl of water. 
JDG.6.39	And Gideon said to God, “Do not let your anger burn
JDG.6.40	And God did so that night; only the fleece was dry, and dew was on all the ground. 
JDG.7.1	Then Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) rose early, and all the army that was with him. They were camped beside the spring of Harod;
JDG.7.2	And Yahweh said to Gideon, “The troops that are with you are too many for me to give Midian into their hands; Israel will boast, saying, ‘My hand has delivered me.’ 
JDG.7.3	So then, please proclaim in the hearing
JDG.7.4	And Yahweh said to Gideon, “There are still too many troops; bring them down to the water, and I will sift through them
JDG.7.5	So he brought down the troops to the water, and Yahweh said to Gideon, “You must separate everyone who laps up the water to drink with his tongue like a dog from those who kneel.”
JDG.7.6	The number of those lapping up the water with their hand to their mouth was three hundred men; all the rest of the troops kneeled to drink the water. 
JDG.7.7	And Yahweh said to Gideon, “I will deliver you with the three hundred men lapping up the water; I will give Midian into your hand, so let the other troops go, each to his own place. 
JDG.7.8	So they took their provisions and their trumpets into their hand, and he sent all the men of Israel, each one, to his tent; but three hundred of the men he kept; the camp of Midian was below him in the valley. 
JDG.7.9	And that night Yahweh said to him, “Get up; go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hand. 
JDG.7.10	But if you are afraid, go down to the camp with Purah your servant, 
JDG.7.11	and you will hear what they say; and afterward you will have courage,
JDG.7.12	Now the Midianites,
JDG.7.13	When Gideon came, a man was recounting a dream
JDG.7.14	His friend answered him and said, “This cannot be anything except the sword of Gideon son of Jehoash, a man of Israel; God has given Midian and the entire camp into his hand.” 
JDG.7.15	When Gideon heard the recounting of the dream
JDG.7.16	He divided the three hundred men into three companies,
JDG.7.17	And he said to them, “Watch me and do the same. When I come to the edge of the camp, do just as I do.
JDG.7.18	When I and all who are with me blow on the trumpet, you must also blow on the trumpets and surround the camp, and you must say, ‘To Yahweh and to Gideon!’ ” 
JDG.7.19	So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle night-watch, when they had just finished setting up the guards, and they blew on the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands.
JDG.7.20	When three companies
JDG.7.21	And each stood in his place
JDG.7.22	When they blew the three hundred trumpets, Yahweh set the sword of each one against his neighbor throughout the whole camp, and the camp
JDG.7.23	And the men of Israel were called from Naphtali, from Asher, and from all of Manasseh, and they pursued after Midian. 
JDG.7.24	And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down to oppose
JDG.7.25	And they captured the two commanders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and they killed Zeeb at the wine press of Zeeb, while they chased Midian; and they brought the heads
JDG.8.1	The men of Ephraim said to him, “What is this thing you have done to us, not calling us when you went to fight against the Midianites?”
JDG.8.2	And he said to them, “What I have done now in comparison with you? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer? 
JDG.8.3	God has given into your hand the commanders of Midian, Oreb, and Zeeb. What have I been able to do in comparison with you?” And their anger
JDG.8.4	Then Gideon came to the Jordan, crossing it with the three hundred men who were with him, weary and pursuing. 
JDG.8.5	He said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who are following me,
JDG.8.6	The officials of Succoth said, “Is the hand
JDG.8.7	Gideon said, “Well then, when Yahweh gives Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will trample your flesh with the thorns and briers of the wilderness.” 
JDG.8.8	He went from there to Penuel, and he spoke similarly to them; and the men of Penuel answered him just as the men of Succoth answered. 
JDG.8.9	And he said also to the men of Penuel, saying, “When I return safely,
JDG.8.10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men remained from the entire army
JDG.8.11	And Gideon went up the route of those who dwell in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he attacked the army
JDG.8.12	And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and he routed
JDG.8.13	Then Gideon son of Jehoash returned from the battle by way of
JDG.8.14	He captured a young man from Succoth
JDG.8.15	He came to the men of Succoth, and he said, “Here is Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Is the palm
JDG.8.16	He took the elders of the city and the thorn bushes and briers of the wilderness, and he trampled
JDG.8.17	He broke down the tower of Penuel, and he killed the men of the city. 
JDG.8.18	And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What type were the men whom you killed at Tabor?” And they said, “They were like you;
JDG.8.19	He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As Yahweh lives, if you had kept them alive I would not kill you.” 
JDG.8.20	And he said to Jether, his firstborn, “Get up, kill them.” But the boy did not draw his sword, for he was afraid because he was still a boy. 
JDG.8.21	Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Get up yourself, and strike us, for as is the man, so is his power.”
JDG.8.22	The men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, both you and your sons, and your sons’ son, for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian. 
JDG.8.23	But Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; Yahweh will rule over you.” 
JDG.8.24	And Gideon said to them, “Let me make a request of you,
JDG.8.25	They said, “We will gladly give them,” and they spread out a garment, and everyone threw there an ornamental ring of his plunder. 
JDG.8.26	The weight of the ornamental rings of gold that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold, apart from the crescents, pendants, and purple garments that were on the kings of Midian, and apart from the pendants that were on the necks of their camels. 
JDG.8.27	Gideon made an ephod out of it, and he put it in his town in Ophrah, and all Israel prostituted themselves to it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family. 
JDG.8.28	And Midian was subdued before the Israelites,
JDG.8.29	Jerub-Baal son of Joash lived in his own house. 
JDG.8.30	Now Gideon had seventy sons, his own offspring,
JDG.8.31	His concubine who was in Shechem also bore for him a son, and he named him
JDG.8.32	And Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age, and he was buried in the tomb of Jehoash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
JDG.8.33	And it happened, as soon as Gideon died, the Israelites
JDG.8.34	The Israelites
JDG.8.35	nor did they show favor
JDG.9.1	And Abimelech son of Jerub-Baal went to Shechem, to the relatives of his mother, and he said to them and to the house of his mother’s father, 
JDG.9.2	“Speak to
JDG.9.3	And his mother’s relatives spoke all these words concerning him to
JDG.9.4	And they gave to him seventy pieces of silver from the temple
JDG.9.5	And he went to his father’s house at Ophrah, and he killed his brothers, the sons of Jerub-Baal, seventy men, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerub-Baal survived, because he hid himself. 
JDG.9.6	All the lords of Shechem and Beth-Millo gathered, and they went and made Abimelech as king, near the oak
JDG.9.7	And they told Jotham, and he went up and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and he cried out loud
JDG.9.8	“The trees went certainly, 
JDG.9.8	to anoint a king over themselves. 
JDG.9.8	And they said to the olive tree, 
JDG.9.8	‘Rule over us.’ 
JDG.9.9	And the olive tree replied, 
JDG.9.9	‘Should I stop producing my oil, 
JDG.9.9	which by me gods and men are honored, 
JDG.9.9	to go sway over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.10	Then the trees said to the fig tree, 
JDG.9.10	‘You, come rule over us.’ 
JDG.9.11	But the fig tree said to them, 
JDG.9.11	‘Should I stop producing my sweetness, 
JDG.9.11	and my good crop, 
JDG.9.11	to go sway over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.12	And the trees said to the vine, 
JDG.9.12	‘You, come rule over us.’ 
JDG.9.13	But the vine said to them, 
JDG.9.13	‘Should I stop producing my wine 
JDG.9.13	that makes the gods and men happy, 
JDG.9.13	to go sway over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.14	So all the trees said to the thornbush, 
JDG.9.14	‘You, come rule over us.’ 
JDG.9.15	And the thornbush said to the trees, 
JDG.9.15	‘If in good faith
JDG.9.15	me as king over you, 
JDG.9.15	then come and take refuge in my shade; 
JDG.9.15	if not, may fire go out from the thornbush 
JDG.9.15	and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’ 
JDG.9.16	“So then, if you have acted in good faith
JDG.9.17	for my father fought and risked his life
JDG.9.18	but today you have risen against the house of my father and killed his sons, seventy men on one stone, and you have made Abimelech, the son of his slave woman, a king over the lords of Shechem, because he is your relative
JDG.9.19	if you have acted in good faith
JDG.9.20	But if not, let a fire come out from Abimelech and let it devour the lords of Shechem and Beth-Millo; and let a fire come out from the lords of Shechem, and from Beth-Millo, and let it devour Abimelech.” 
JDG.9.21	And Jotham escaped and fled, and went to Beer; he remained there because of Abimelech his brother. 
JDG.9.22	Abimelech ruled over Israel three years. 
JDG.9.23	And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the lords of Shechem, and the lords of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech, 
JDG.9.24	so that the violence done to the seventy brothers of Abimelech would be avenged and their blood be placed on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the lords of Shechem, who helped
JDG.9.25	And the lords of Shechem set for him ambushes on the top of the mountains, and they robbed all who passed by them along the road; and it was reported to Abimelech. 
JDG.9.26	And Gaal son of Ebel and his relatives came, and they crossed over into Shechem, and the lords of Shechem gave him confidence.
JDG.9.27	They went out into the field and harvested their vineyards and trod them, and they held a festival.
JDG.9.28	Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who are we of Shechem that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerub-Baal, and is not Zebul his chief officer?
JDG.9.29	If only this people were in my command!
JDG.9.30	When Zebul the commander of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, he became angry,
JDG.9.31	and he sent messengers to Abimelech in Tormah, saying, “Look, Gaal son of Ebed and his relatives are coming to Shechem, and they are stirring up the city against you. 
JDG.9.32	So then, get up by night, you and the army that is with you, and lie in ambush in the field. 
JDG.9.33	And in the morning at sunrise, get up and rush the city; and look, when he and the troops who are with him come out to you, you must act according to whatever opportunity offers itself.
JDG.9.34	So Abimelech and all the army that was with him got up by night, and they lay in ambush against Shechem in four divisions.
JDG.9.35	Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate, and Abimelech and the army that was with him got up from the ambush. 
JDG.9.36	When Gaal saw the army, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the top of the mountains!” And Zebul said to him, “The shadows of the mountains look like people to you.”
JDG.9.37	And Gaal spoke again
JDG.9.38	And Zebul said to him, “Where then is your boast,
JDG.9.39	So Gaal went out before the lords of Shechem and fought against Abimelech. 
JDG.9.40	And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him; many fell slain up to the entrance of the gate. 
JDG.9.41	So Abimelech resided at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives
JDG.9.42	On the next day the people went out to the field; and it was reported to Abimelech, 
JDG.9.43	so he took the army and divided them into three divisions,
JDG.9.44	Then Abimelech and the divisions
JDG.9.45	Abimelech fought against the city all that day, and he captured the city and killed the people that were in it; then he broke down the city and sowed it with salt. 
JDG.9.46	When all the lords of the tower of Shechem heard, they went to the vault
JDG.9.47	It was told to Abimelech that all the lords of the tower of Shechem had gathered. 
JDG.9.48	So Abimelech went up Mount Zalmon, he and all his army that were with him, and Abimelech took the ax
JDG.9.49	So the whole army cut down each one branch for himself and followed Abimelech, and they put them against the vault
JDG.9.50	Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he encamped against Thebez and captured it. 
JDG.9.51	But there was a strong tower in the middle of the city, and all the men, women, and lords of the city fled there and shut themselves in; and they went up to the roof of the tower. 
JDG.9.52	Abimelech came up to the tower and fought against it, and he came near the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire. 
JDG.9.53	But a certain woman
JDG.9.54	He called quickly to the young man carrying his weapons, and he said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that they will not say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ ” So the young man
JDG.9.55	When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, each one went to his home.
JDG.9.56	So God repaid
JDG.9.57	And God also repaid all the wickedness
JDG.10.1	After Abimelech, Tola son of Puah son of Dod, a man of Issachar, rose up to deliver Israel; and he was living at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.10.2	And he judged Israel twenty-three years. And he died and was buried in Shamir. 
JDG.10.3	After him Jair the Gileadite rose up, and he judged Israel twenty-two years. 
JDG.10.4	And he had thirty sons who would ride on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty towns that are in the land of Gilead that they called Havvoth Jair until this day. 
JDG.10.5	And Jair died and was buried in Kamon. 
JDG.10.6	And again, the Israelites
JDG.10.7	And the anger of Yahweh burned
JDG.10.8	They crushed and oppressed the Israelites
JDG.10.9	The Ammonites
JDG.10.10	Then the Israelites
JDG.10.11	And Yahweh said to the Israelites,
JDG.10.12	And when the Sidonians, the Amalekites,
JDG.10.13	Yet you have abandoned me and served other gods. Therefore I will no longer deliver you. 
JDG.10.14	Go and cry out to the gods whom you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your trouble.” 
JDG.10.15	And the Israelites
JDG.10.16	So they removed the foreign gods from their midst and served Yahweh; and he could no longer bear
JDG.10.17	And the Ammonites
JDG.10.18	The people, the ones commanding Gilead, said to each other,
JDG.11.1	Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior; he was the son of a prostitute, and Gilead was his father.
JDG.11.2	Gilead’s wife also bore for him sons; and the sons of his wife grew up and drove Jephthah away, and they said to him, “You will not inherit the house of our father because you are the son of another woman.” 
JDG.11.3	So Jephthah fled from the presence of his brothers, and he lived in the land of Tob. And outlaws
JDG.11.4	After a time the Ammonites
JDG.11.5	When the Ammonites
JDG.11.6	And they said to Jephthah, “Come and be our commander, so that we may make war against the Ammonites.”
JDG.11.7	Jephthah said to the elders, “Did you not shun me and drive me out from the house of my father? Why do you come to me now when you have trouble?” 
JDG.11.8	And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “That being so, we have now returned to you, that you may go with us to fight
JDG.11.9	So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you bring me back to fight
JDG.11.10	And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Yahweh will be a witness
JDG.11.11	So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them. And Jephthah spoke all his words before Yahweh at Mizpah. 
JDG.11.12	And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites,
JDG.11.13	And the king of the Ammonites
JDG.11.14	Once again Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites,
JDG.11.15	and he said to him, “Thus says Jephthah, ‘Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites,
JDG.11.16	because when they came up from Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea
JDG.11.17	Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, “Please let us cross through your land,” but the king of Edom would not listen. And they also sent messengers to the king of Moab, but he was not willing. So Israel stayed in Kadesh. 
JDG.11.18	Then they traveled through the wilderness, went around the land of Edom and Moab, and came to the east
JDG.11.19	Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites,
JDG.11.20	But Sihon did not trust Israel to cross through his territory, so Sihon gathered all his people and then encamped at Jahaz; and he made war with Israel. 
JDG.11.21	And Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them; and Israel occupied all the land of the Amorites
JDG.11.22	They occupied all the territory of the Amorites
JDG.11.23	So then Yahweh, the God of Israel, has driven out the Amorites
JDG.11.24	Do you not possess what Chemosh your god gave you to possess? Whoever Yahweh our God has driven out before us, we will possess it. 
JDG.11.25	So then, are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever quarrel with Israel, or did he ever make war against them? 
JDG.11.26	When Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the towns that are along the Arnon,
JDG.11.27	I have not sinned against you; but you are the one who is doing wrong by making war against me. Let Yahweh judge
JDG.11.28	But the king of the Ammonites
JDG.11.29	And the Spirit of Yahweh came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh. He passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed through to the Ammonites.
JDG.11.30	And Jephthah made a vow to Yahweh, and he said, “If indeed you will give the Ammonites
JDG.11.31	whatever
JDG.11.32	And Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites
JDG.11.33	And he defeated them with a very great blow, from Aroer as far as Minnith, twenty towns,
JDG.11.34	Jephthah came to Mizpah, to his house, and behold his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and dancing. She was his only child; he did not have a son or daughter except her. 
JDG.11.35	And the moment he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, “Ah! My daughter, you have caused me to bow down, and you have become my trouble. I made an oath
JDG.11.36	She said to him, “My father, you made an oath
JDG.11.37	And she said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me: grant me two months so that I may go wander
JDG.11.38	And he said, “Go.” He sent her away for two months, and she went with her friends, and she lamented over her virginity on the mountains. 
JDG.11.39	At the end of the two months she returned to her father, and he did to her according to his vow; and she did not sleep with a man.
JDG.11.40	for the daughters of Israel to go and lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for forty days of the year. 
JDG.12.1	The men of Ephraim were called to arms, and they crossed over to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over and make war against the Ammonites,
JDG.12.2	And Jephthah said to them, “I and my people were engaged in great conflict with the Ammonites;
JDG.12.3	I saw that you would not deliver us; I risked my own life,
JDG.12.4	Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead, and he made war with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim because they said, “You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and Manasseh.” 
JDG.12.5	Then Gilead captured the fords of the Jordan from Ephraim, and whenever a fugitive of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead said to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” When he said, “No,” 
JDG.12.6	they said to him, “Please say Shibboleth,” and if he said, “Sibboleth”—because he could not pronounce it
JDG.12.7	Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and he was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. 
JDG.12.8	After him Ibzan from Bethlehem judged Israel. 
JDG.12.9	He had thirty sons. He gave his thirty daughters away in marriage outside his clan and brought in from outside thirty young women for his sons. He judged Israel for seven years. 
JDG.12.10	Then
JDG.12.11	After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years. 
JDG.12.12	Then
JDG.12.13	After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 
JDG.12.14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons that rode on seventy male donkeys. He judged Israel for eight years. 
JDG.12.15	Then
JDG.13.1	And again, the Israelites
JDG.13.2	There was a certain man from Zorah, from the tribe of the Danites, and his name was Manoah; his wife was infertile and did not bear children. 
JDG.13.3	And an angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman, and he said to her, “Behold, you are infertile and have not borne children, but you will conceive and bear a son. 
JDG.13.4	So then, be careful and do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, 
JDG.13.5	because you will conceive and bear a son. No razor will touch
JDG.13.6	And the woman came and told her husband, saying, “A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask him from where he came, and he did not tell me his name. 
JDG.13.7	And he said to me, ‘Look, you will conceive and bear a son, so then, do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, for the boy will be a Nazirite of God from birth
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah prayed to Yahweh and said, “Excuse me, my Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent again come to us and teach us what we should do concerning the boy who will be born.” 
JDG.13.9	And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and an angel of God came again to the woman; she was sitting in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her. 
JDG.13.10	The woman quickly ran and told her husband, and she said to him, “Look! The man who came to me the other day appeared to me.” 
JDG.13.11	So Manoah got up and went after his wife, and he came to the man and said to him, “Are you the man that spoke to the woman?” And he said, “I am.” 
JDG.13.12	And Manoah said to him, “Now when your words come true,
JDG.13.13	And the angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, “Let the woman be attentive to all that I said. 
JDG.13.14	She should not eat of anything that comes from the vine, or drink wine or strong drink, or eat anything unclean; she should keep all that I commanded.” 
JDG.13.15	And Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, “Please stay,
JDG.13.16	The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, “If you keep me, I will not eat your food, but if you prepare a burnt offering for Yahweh, you can offer it (for Manoah did not know that he was an angel of Yahweh).” 
JDG.13.17	And Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, “What is your name so that when your words come true we may honor you?” 
JDG.13.18	But the angel of Yahweh said to him, “Why do you ask my name? It is too wonderful.” 
JDG.13.19	And Manoah took the young goat
JDG.13.20	And when the flame went up toward the heaven from the altar, the angel of Yahweh went up in the flame of the altar to heaven while Manoah and his wife were watching. And they fell on their faces to the ground. 
JDG.13.21	The angel of Yahweh did not appear again to Manoah and his wife, and then Manoah knew that he was a messenger
JDG.13.22	And Manoah said to his wife, “We will certainly die because we have seen God.” 
JDG.13.23	But his wife said to him, “If Yahweh wanted to kill us he would not have taken
JDG.13.24	The woman bore a son, and she called him Samson; the boy grew big, and Yahweh blessed him. 
JDG.13.25	And the Spirit of Yahweh began to stir him in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol. 
JDG.14.1	And Samson went down to Timnah, and he saw a woman in Timnah from the daughters of the Philistines. 
JDG.14.2	He went up and told his father and mother, and he said, “I saw a woman in Timnah from the daughters of the Philistines; so then, take her for me as a wife.” 
JDG.14.3	But his father and mother said to him, “Is there not a wife among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our
JDG.14.4	His father and mother did not know that this was from Yahweh; he was seeking for an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines were ruling
JDG.14.5	And Samson and his father and mother went down to Timnah, and they came to the vineyards of Timnah, and suddenly a young lion came roaring to meet him. 
JDG.14.6	And the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon him, and he tore the lion apart as one might tear apart a male kid goat (he was bare-handed).
JDG.14.7	Then he went down and talked to the woman, and she pleased Samson.
JDG.14.8	And he returned after awhile to marry her,
JDG.14.9	He scraped it out into his hands, and he went on, eating it as he went. And he went to his father and mother and gave some to them, and they ate it. But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the body of the lion. 
JDG.14.10	His father went down to the woman, and Samson prepared there a feast, as young men were accustomed to doing this. 
JDG.14.11	When they saw him, they took thirty companions, and they were with him. 
JDG.14.12	And Samson said to them, “Let me tell you a riddle. If you can fully explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, I will give to you thirty linen garments and thirty festal garments. 
JDG.14.13	But if you are unable to explain it to me, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty festal garments.” So they said to him, “Tell your riddle; let us hear it.” 
JDG.14.14	He said to them, 
JDG.14.14	“From the eater came out food, 
JDG.14.14	From the strong came out sweet.” 
JDG.14.14	But they were unable to explain the riddle for three days. 
JDG.14.15	When it was the fourth
JDG.14.16	And Samson’s wife wept before him, and she said, “You must hate me; you do not love me. You told the riddle to my people,
JDG.14.17	She wept before him the seven days of their feast; and it happened, because she nagged him, on the seventh day he explained it to her, and she told the riddle to her people.
JDG.14.18	The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, 
JDG.14.18	“What is sweeter than honey? 
JDG.14.18	What is stronger than a lion?” 
JDG.14.18	And he said to them, 
JDG.14.18	“If you had not plowed with my heifer, 
JDG.14.18	you would not have found out my riddle.” 
JDG.14.19	And the Spirit of Yahweh rushed on him, and he went down to Ashkelon. He killed thirty men from them, and he took their belongings, and he gave festal garments to the ones that explained the riddle. He was angry,
JDG.14.20	And Samson’s wife was given to his companion who was his best man.
JDG.15.1	After a while, at the time of the wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat.
JDG.15.2	Her father said, “I really thought that you hated her, so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please, take her instead.”
JDG.15.3	And Samson said to them, “This time, as far as the Philistines are concerned, when I do something evil I am without blame.” 
JDG.15.4	And Samson went and captured three hundred foxes, and he took torches. He turned them tail to tail, and he put one torch between two tails. 
JDG.15.5	He set fire to the torches and let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and he burned both the stacks
JDG.15.6	And the Philistines said, “Who has done this?” And they said, “Samson the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his companion.” And the Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire. 
JDG.15.7	Samson said to them, “If you want to behave like this, I swear I will not rest unless I have taken revenge on you.” 
JDG.15.8	And he gave them a thorough beating,
JDG.15.9	Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah, and they overran Lehi. 
JDG.15.10	And the men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” And they said, “To bind Samson; to do to him just as he did to us.” 
JDG.15.11	Then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and they said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines are ruling over us? What is this that you have done to us?” And he said to them, “Just as they did to me, so I have done to them.” 
JDG.15.12	They said to him, “We have come down to bind you and give you over into the hand of the Philistines.” And Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves.” 
JDG.15.13	They said to him, “No, we will only bind you and give you into their hand; we will certainly not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes, and they brought him up from the rock. 
JDG.15.14	As he came up to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him; and the Spirit of Yahweh rushed on him, and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that has burned with fire, and his bindings melted from his hands. 
JDG.15.15	And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey; he reached down and took it and killed one thousand men with it. 
JDG.15.16	And Samson said, 
JDG.15.16	“With the jawbone of the donkey, 
JDG.15.16	heap upon heap; 
JDG.15.16	with the jawbone of the donkey, 
JDG.15.16	I struck dead one thousand men.” 
JDG.15.17	And it happened, when he finished speaking he threw the jawbone from his hand; and he called that place Ramath Lehi.
JDG.15.18	And he was very thirsty, and he called to Yahweh and said, “You gave this great victory into the hand of your servant, but now I must die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?” 
JDG.15.19	So God split the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out from it; and he drank, and his spirit returned, and he was revived. Thus he called its name The Spring of Ha-Qore,
JDG.15.20	And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years. 
JDG.16.1	Samson went down to Gaza; there he saw a prostitute and had sex with her.
JDG.16.2	The Gazites were told, “Samson has come here,” so they surrounded the place and lay in ambush for him all night at the city gate. They kept silent all night, saying, “We will wait until the morning light, and then we will kill him.” 
JDG.16.3	But Samson lay until the middle of the night; he got up in the middle of the night and took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two door posts, tore them loose with the bar, put them on his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the hill that is in front of
JDG.16.4	After this he fell in love with a woman in the wadi
JDG.16.5	And the rulers of the Philistines came up to her and said, “Entice him and find out what makes his strength so great, and how we can overpower him, so that we may bind him up in order to subdue him; each of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver. 
JDG.16.6	So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me what makes your strength so great, and with what can you be tied up to subdue you?” 
JDG.16.7	Samson said to her, “If you tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that are not dried up, I will become weak like everyone else.” 
JDG.16.8	So the rulers of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that were not dried up, and she tied him up with them. 
JDG.16.9	The ambush was sitting in wait for her in an inner room. And she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you Samson!” And he snapped the bowstrings just as flax fiber snaps when it comes close to fire. And the secret of his strength remained unknown. 
JDG.16.10	Delilah said to Samson, “Look, you have mocked me and told me lies. Please tell me how you can be bound.” 
JDG.16.11	He said to her, “If they tie me tightly with new ropes that have not been used, I will become weak and be like everyone else.” 
JDG.16.12	So Delilah took new ropes and tied him up with them, and she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” (The ambush was sitting in an inner room.) But he snapped them from his arms like thread. 
JDG.16.13	And Delilah said to Samson, “Until now you have mocked me and told lies to me. Tell me how you can be bound.” And he said to her, “If you weave seven locks of my head with warp-threads.”
JDG.16.14	She fastened it with the pin and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And Samson woke up from his sleep and tore loose the loom pin of the web and the warp-threads.
JDG.16.15	And she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and you have not told me how your strength is so great.” 
JDG.16.16	And because she nagged him day after day with her words, and pestered him, his soul grew impatient to the point of death.
JDG.16.17	So he confided everything to her,
JDG.16.18	Delilah realized that he had confided in her,
JDG.16.19	And she put him to sleep on her lap; then she called the men
JDG.16.20	And she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And he woke up from his sleep and said, “I will go out just like every other time and shake myself free,” but he did not know that Yahweh had left him. 
JDG.16.21	And the Philistines seized him, gouged his eyes, and brought him to Gaza. They tied him up with bronze shackles, and he became a grinder in the prison.
JDG.16.22	But the hair of his head began to grow back after it had been shaved off. 
JDG.16.23	The rulers of the Philistines had gathered to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice. And they said, “Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand.” 
JDG.16.24	And the people saw him, and they praised their god, for they said, “Our god has given into our hand those who hate us, devastate our land, and have killed many of us.”
JDG.16.25	After awhile, when their hearts
JDG.16.26	Then Samson said to the servant who was holding him by his hand, “Position me so that I can touch the pillars on which the house
JDG.16.27	And the house
JDG.16.28	And Samson called to Yahweh and said, “My Lord Yahweh, remember me! Please give me strength this one time, O God, so that I can repay with one act of revenge to the Philistines for my eyes.” 
JDG.16.29	And Samson reached out and held two of the middle pillars on which the house
JDG.16.30	And Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines.” And he pushed
JDG.16.31	His brothers and his whole family
JDG.17.1	There was a man from the hill country of Ephraim; his name was Micah. 
JDG.17.2	And he said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, and about which you also pronounced a curse in my hearing,
JDG.17.3	He returned the eleven hundred pieces
JDG.17.4	When he returned the pieces
JDG.17.5	The man Micah had for himself a shrine,
JDG.17.6	In those days there was no king in Israel, and each one did what was right in his own eyes. 
JDG.17.7	There was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, from the clan of Judah; he was a Levite and was dwelling as a foreigner
JDG.17.8	And the man went from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to live as a foreigner
JDG.17.9	And Micah said to him, “From where do you come?” And he said to him, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah; I am going to dwell as a foreigner
JDG.17.10	And Micah said to him, “Stay with me and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give to you ten pieces
JDG.17.11	The Levite agreed to stay with the man; and the young man became as one of his sons. 
JDG.17.12	So Micah appointed the Levite,
JDG.17.13	And Micah said, “Now I know Yahweh will make me prosperous, because the Levite has become my priest.” 
JDG.18.1	In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking territory for itself to live in, because until that day it had not been allotted territory among the tribes of Israel. 
JDG.18.2	The descendants
JDG.18.3	While they were with the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite, and they turned aside there and said to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place, and what is your business here?”
JDG.18.4	And he said to them, “Micah did such and such for me and hired me, and I became his priest.” 
JDG.18.5	And they said to him, “Please inquire of God that we may know whether our journey that we are going on will be successful.” 
JDG.18.6	And the priest said to them, “Go in peace. Yahweh is in front of you on the journey you want to go on.” 
JDG.18.7	And the five men went and came to Laish, and they observed the people who were living according to the customs of the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting, and lacking nothing in the land, and possessing restraint.
JDG.18.8	They came to their relatives
JDG.18.9	And they said to them, “Come, let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and it is very good. Will you do nothing? Do not hesitate to go, to enter, to possess the land. 
JDG.18.10	When you go you will come to an unsuspecting people, and the land is spread out on all sides;
JDG.18.11	Six hundred men from the clan of the Danites from Zorah and Eshtaol, armed with weapons of war, set out from there. 
JDG.18.12	They went up and encamped at Kiriath Jearim in Judah. Therefore they called this place Camp of Dan
JDG.18.13	From there they crossed over to the hill country of Ephraim, and they came to the house of Micah. 
JDG.18.14	And the five men that went out to spy out the land (that is, Laish) responded and said to their relatives,
JDG.18.15	So they turned to that direction, and they came to the house of the young Levite, the house of Micah, and they greeted him.
JDG.18.16	And six hundred men from the descendants
JDG.18.17	And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and they entered there and took the carved divine image, ephod, teraphim, and the molten image. The priest was standing at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with the weapons of war. 
JDG.18.18	When these went to Micah’s house, they took the divine carved image, ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, and the priest asked them, “What are you doing?” 
JDG.18.19	And they said to him, “Keep quiet! Put your hand on your mouth and come with us and be for us a father and a priest. Is it better being a priest for a house of one man or being a priest for a tribe and clan in Israel?” 
JDG.18.20	The priest accepted the offer,
JDG.18.21	And they turned
JDG.18.22	When they were at a distance from the house, Micah and the men who were in the houses that were near the house of Micah cried out, and they overtook the descendants
JDG.18.23	And they called to the descendants
JDG.18.24	He said, “You took away my gods that I had made, and the priest, and then you go away. What is now left for me? How can you say to me, ‘What is the matter?’ ” 
JDG.18.25	And the descendants
JDG.18.26	And the descendants
JDG.18.27	And they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and they came to Laish, to a quiet and unsuspecting people, and they put them to the sword
JDG.18.28	There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had had no dealings with anyone.
JDG.18.29	And they called the name of the city Dan, after Dan their ancestor,
JDG.18.30	And the descendants
JDG.18.31	So they set up for themselves the carved divine image that Micah had made, all the days that the house of God was in Shiloh. 
JDG.19.1	In those days there was no king in Israel; there was a man, a Levite, who dwelled as a foreigner
JDG.19.2	But his concubine felt repugnance toward him,
JDG.19.3	So her husband set out, and he went after her to speak tenderly to her,
JDG.19.4	His father-in-law, the young woman’s father, urged him to stay with him three days; and they ate and drank, and they spent the night there. 
JDG.19.5	On the fourth day, they rose early in the morning, and he prepared to go, but the father of the young woman said to his son-in-law, “Refresh yourself
JDG.19.6	So the two of them sat and ate and drank together, and the father of the young woman said to the man, “Please, agree to spend the night and enjoy yourself.”
JDG.19.7	The man got up to go, but his father-in-law urged him, and he returned and spent the night there. 
JDG.19.8	On the fifth day he rose early in the morning to go, and the father of the young woman said, “Please, enjoy yourself,”
JDG.19.9	And the man got up to go—he, his concubine, and his servant—but his father-in-law, the father of the young woman, said to him, “Please, the day has worn on to evening; please, spend the night, the day has drawn to a close. Spend the night here and enjoy yourself.
JDG.19.10	But the man was not willing to spend the night, and he got up and went; and he arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a pair of saddled donkeys and his concubine. 
JDG.19.11	They were near Jebus, and the day was far spent,
JDG.19.12	But his master said to him, “We will not turn aside to the city of foreigners,
JDG.19.13	And he said to his servant, “Come, let us approach one of these places; we will spend the night in Gibeah or in Ramah.” 
JDG.19.14	So they crossed over and went their way, and the sun went down on them beside Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin. 
JDG.19.15	And they turned aside there to enter and to spend the night at Gibeah. And they went and sat in the open square of the city, but no one took them in to spend the night.
JDG.19.16	Then behold, an old man was coming from his work from the field in the evening, and the man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was dwelling as a foreigner
JDG.19.17	And the old man raised his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city, and he said, “Where are you going, and from where do you come?” 
JDG.19.18	And he said to him, “We are crossing over from Bethlehem in Judah up to the remote areas of the hill country of Ephraim, where I am from. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, but now I am going to Yahweh’s house,
JDG.19.19	There is both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and also bread and wine for me, for your servant,
JDG.19.20	And the old man said, “Peace to you. I will take care of your needs; however, you must not spend the night in the open square.” 
JDG.19.21	So he brought him to his house, and he fed the donkeys; they washed their feet, ate, and drank. 
JDG.19.22	While they were enjoying themselves,
JDG.19.23	So the man, the owner of the house, went out to them and said to them, “No, my brothers, do not act wickedly; since this man has come into my house, do not do this disgraceful thing. 
JDG.19.24	Here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. Please, let me bring them out; do violence to them,
JDG.19.25	But the men were not willing to listen to him, and the man seized his concubine and brought her out to them; and they had intercourse with her, and they abused her all night until the morning; they let her go at the approach of dawn. 
JDG.19.26	And the woman came as the morning appeared, and she fell at the entrance of the man’s house where her master was, until daylight.
JDG.19.27	In the morning her master got up, and he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his journey, and behold, his concubine was falling
JDG.19.28	And he said to her, “Get up, let us go,” but there was no answer. So he put her on the donkey, and the man got up and went to his place. 
JDG.19.29	When he entered his house he took a knife, and he grasped his concubine and cut her into twelve pieces; and he sent her throughout the whole territory of Israel. 
JDG.19.30	All who saw it said, “Nothing like this has ever been since the Israelites
JDG.20.1	All the Israelites
JDG.20.2	And the leaders of all the people, all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand sword-bearing infantry. 
JDG.20.3	(The descendants
JDG.20.4	The Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered and said, “I came to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night. 
JDG.20.5	The lords of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house at night. They intended to kill me, and they raped my concubine, and she died. 
JDG.20.6	Then I grabbed my concubine and cut her into pieces, and I sent her throughout all the territory of Israel’s inheritance; for they committed a shameful and disgraceful thing in Israel. 
JDG.20.7	Look, all you Israelites!
JDG.20.8	All the people got up as one body,
JDG.20.9	So then, this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against her by lot. 
JDG.20.10	We will take ten men of one hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and one thousand of ten thousand, to bring provisions to the troops, to repay them when they come to Gibeah
JDG.20.11	And all the men of Israel were gathered to the city as one body
JDG.20.12	Then the tribes of Israel sent men throughout all the tribes of Benjamin, saying, “What is this wickedness that happened among you? 
JDG.20.13	So then, hand over the men, the perverse lot,
JDG.20.14	And the descendants
JDG.20.15	From the cities the descendants
JDG.20.16	From all these troops were seven hundred well-trained
JDG.20.17	And the men of Israel besides Benjamin were counted four hundred thousand sword-wielding men;
JDG.20.18	Then the Israelites
JDG.20.19	And the Israelites
JDG.20.20	Then the men of Israel marched out for the battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel took up positions against them for battle at Gibeah. 
JDG.20.21	The descendants
JDG.20.22	But the troops, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves,
JDG.20.23	The Israelites
JDG.20.24	And the Israelites
JDG.20.25	And Benjamin went out from Gibeah to meet them on the second day, and they struck down the Israelites
JDG.20.26	And all the Israelites
JDG.20.27	And the Israelites
JDG.20.28	and Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, was standing before it
JDG.20.29	So Israel stationed an ambush all around Gibeah. 
JDG.20.30	And the Israelites
JDG.20.31	The descendants
JDG.20.32	And the descendants
JDG.20.33	And all the men of Israel got up from their places
JDG.20.34	Then ten thousand well-trained
JDG.20.35	And Yahweh defeated Benjamin in the presence of Israel, and the Israelites
JDG.20.36	The descendants
JDG.20.37	And the ambush came quickly and advanced against Gibeah, and it put the whole city to the sword.
JDG.20.38	Now the appointed time for the men of Israel with the ambush was that they sent up for them a great amount of smoke from the city. 
JDG.20.39	And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to inflict casualties on about thirty men of Israel because they thought,
JDG.20.40	And the cloud of smoke began to go up from the city in a column of smoke, and Benjamin turned backward, and behold, the whole city was going up in smoke!
JDG.20.41	And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed because they saw that disaster was closing in
JDG.20.42	And they retreated from before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness, but the battle caught up to them, and those who came from the cities
JDG.20.43	They surrounded Benjamin; they pursued them
JDG.20.44	And eighteen thousand men from Benjamin fell, all of them able men.
JDG.20.45	And they turned and fled toward the wilderness, to the rock of Rimmon, but they cut down on the main roads five thousand men; and they pursued after them up to Gidom, and they struck down two thousand men. 
JDG.20.46	So all of Benjamin who fell on that day were twenty-five thousand sword-wielding men;
JDG.20.47	But six hundred turned and fled toward the wilderness, to the rock of Rimmon, and they remained at the rock of Rimmon for four months. 
JDG.20.48	And the men of Israel returned to the descendants
JDG.21.1	The men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah, saying, “None of us will give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife.” 
JDG.21.2	And the people of Bethel came and sat there until evening before God, and they lifted their voices and wept bitterly.
JDG.21.3	And they said, “Why, Yahweh, God of Israel, has it happened today in Israel that one tribe is lacking from Israel?” 
JDG.21.4	On the next day the people rose early, and they built there an altar and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. 
JDG.21.5	And the Israelites
JDG.21.6	But the Israelites
JDG.21.7	What will we do for them—for the ones being left over—for wives? For we have sworn by Yahweh not to give to them our daughters as wives.” 
JDG.21.8	They asked, “Which one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Yahweh at Mizpah?” And behold, no one came from Jabesh-gilead to the camp, to the assembly. 
JDG.21.9	The people were counted, and no one was there from the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead. 
JDG.21.10	And the congregation sent there twelve thousand men from the troops, and they commanded them, saying, “Go, strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword,
JDG.21.11	This is the thing you will do: you will destroy
JDG.21.12	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins
JDG.21.13	Then the congregation sent and spoke all this to the descendants
JDG.21.14	And Benjamin returned at that time, and they gave to them the women whom they kept alive from Jabesh-gilead; but they were not enough for them. 
JDG.21.15	And the people felt sorry for Benjamin because Yahweh weakened the tribes of Israel.
JDG.21.16	So the elders of the congregation said, “What should we do for the remaining ones for wives, since the women from Benjamin have been destroyed?” 
JDG.21.17	And they said, “There must be a remnant for Benjamin, so that a tribe will not be blotted out from Israel. 
JDG.21.18	But we cannot give them wives from our daughters.” (For the Israelites
JDG.21.19	And they said, “Look, the annual feast of Yahweh is in Shiloh, which is to the north of Bethel, east
JDG.21.20	They instructed the descendants
JDG.21.21	and watch and look; when the daughters of Shiloh dance in the dances, come out from the vineyards and seize for yourselves a wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. 
JDG.21.22	And if their fathers or their brothers complain to us, we will say to them, ‘Allow us to have them, because we did not capture a wife for each man in the battle, and because you did not give them to them, or else
JDG.21.23	The descendants
JDG.21.24	So the Israelites
JDG.21.25	In those days there was no king in Israel; each one did what was right in his own eyes. 
RUT.1.1	And it happened in the days when the judges ruled,
RUT.1.2	And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephraimites from Bethlehem in Judah. And they went to the countryside of Moab and remained there. 
RUT.1.3	But Elimelech the husband of Naomi died and she was left behind with her two sons.
RUT.1.4	And they took
RUT.1.5	But both
RUT.1.6	And she got up, she and her daughters-in-law, and returned from the countryside of Moab, because she had heard in the countryside of Moab that Yahweh had come to the aid of
RUT.1.7	So she set out from the place where she was
RUT.1.8	But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, each of you return to her mother’s house. May Yahweh show kindness to you
RUT.1.9	May Yahweh grant that you
RUT.1.10	And they said to her, “No, we want to return with you to your people.” 
RUT.1.11	And Naomi said, “Return, my daughters. Why do you still want to go with me?
RUT.1.12	Turn back, my daughters! Go, for I am too old to have a husband.
RUT.1.13	would you therefore wait until they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying?
RUT.1.14	And they lifted up their voices and cried again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her. 
RUT.1.15	And she said, “Look, your sister-in-law has returned to her people and to her gods. Return after your sister-in-law too.” 
RUT.1.16	But Ruth said, “Do not urge
RUT.1.17	Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. So may Yahweh do to me, and even more, unless
RUT.1.18	When Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more.
RUT.1.19	So the two of them went until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came
RUT.1.20	And she said to them, “You should not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for Shaddai
RUT.1.21	I went away full, but Yahweh brought me back empty-handed! Why call me Naomi when Yahweh has testified against me
RUT.1.22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabite her daughter-in-law with her, returning from the countryside of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the harvest of barley. 
RUT.2.1	Now
RUT.2.2	And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after someone in whose eyes I may find favor.” And she said to her, “Go, my daughter.” 
RUT.2.3	So she went and came and gleaned in the field behind the reapers. And she happened by chance upon the tract of field belonging to
RUT.2.4	And look, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “May Yahweh be with you.” And they said to him, “May Yahweh bless you.” 
RUT.2.5	And Boaz said to his servant in charge of the reapers,
RUT.2.6	And the servant in charge of the reapers
RUT.2.7	And she said, ‘Please let me glean and let me gather among the sheaves behind the reapers.’ So she came and remained from the morning up to now. She is sitting for a little while in the house.”
RUT.2.8	And Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen carefully,
RUT.2.9	Keep your eyes on the field that they reap and go after them. Have I not ordered the servants not to bother you? And if you get thirsty, you shall go to the containers and drink from where the servants have drawn.” 
RUT.2.10	And she fell on her face and bowed down to the ground and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your eyes by recognizing me—for I am a foreigner?” 
RUT.2.11	And Boaz answered and said to her, “All that you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband was fully told to me. How you left your father and mother and the land of your birth, and you went to a people that you did not know before.
RUT.2.12	May Yahweh reward your work and may a full reward be given to you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you came to take refuge.” 
RUT.2.13	And she said, “May I find favor in your eyes, my lord, for you have comforted me and have spoken kindly to your servant,
RUT.2.14	And Boaz said to her at mealtime,
RUT.2.15	And she got up to glean, and Boaz instructed his servants saying, “Let her also glean between the sheaves and do not reproach her. 
RUT.2.16	And also pull out for her from your bundles and leave it so that she may glean—and do not rebuke her.” 
RUT.2.17	So she gleaned in the field until the evening and she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. 
RUT.2.18	And she picked it up and went to the town. Her mother-in-law saw how much she had gleaned. And she took it out and gave to her what she had left over after being satisfied.
RUT.2.19	And her mother-in-law said to her, “Where did you glean today
RUT.2.20	And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by Yahweh, whose loyal love has not forsaken the living or the dead.” And Naomi said to her, “The man is a close relative for us, he is one of our redeemers.” 
RUT.2.21	And Ruth the Moabite said, “Also, he said to me, ‘You shall stay close with the servants which are mine until they have finished all of the harvest which is mine.’ ” 
RUT.2.22	And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidservants so that you will not be bothered
RUT.2.23	So she stayed close with the maidservants of Boaz to glean until the end of the barley harvest and wheat harvest. And she lived with her mother-in-law. 
RUT.3.1	Now Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, should I not seek for you security that things may be good for you? 
RUT.3.2	So then, is not Boaz our kinsman whose maidservants you were with? Look, he is winnowing the barley at the threshing floor tonight. 
RUT.3.3	Wash, anoint yourself, put your clothing on, and go down to the threshing floor. Do not make yourself known to the man until he finishes eating and drinking. 
RUT.3.4	And when he lies, take notice of the place where he lies. And you shall go and uncover
RUT.3.5	And she said to her, “I will do all that you say.” 
RUT.3.6	And she went down to the threshing floor and did all that her mother-in-law had instructed her. 
RUT.3.7	And Boaz ate and drank until his heart was merry
RUT.3.8	And it happened in the middle of the night the man was startled and he reached out and behold, a woman was lying at his feet. 
RUT.3.9	And he said, “Who are you?” And she said, “I am Ruth, your servant. Spread your garment
RUT.3.10	And he said, “You are blessed by Yahweh my daughter. You did better in this last kindness than the first by not going after young men, whether poor or rich. 
RUT.3.11	And so then my daughter, do not be afraid. All that you ask I will do for you, for the entire assembly of my people knows that you are a worthy woman. 
RUT.3.12	Now truly I am a redeemer, but there is also a redeemer of a closer relationship than me. 
RUT.3.13	Stay tonight,
RUT.3.14	So she lay at his feet until morning and got up before anyone could recognize each other.
RUT.3.15	And he said, “Bring the cloak that is on you and hold it out.”
RUT.3.16	And she came to her mother-in-law, and she said, “How did it go for you,
RUT.3.17	And she said, “These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said, ‘You shall not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law.’ ” 
RUT.3.18	And she said, “Wait, my daughter, until you know how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest but will settle the matter today.” 
RUT.4.1	And Boaz had gone up to the city gate and sat there. And look, the redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken was passing by. And he said, “Come over here to sit, friend.”
RUT.4.2	And he took ten men from the elders of the city and said, “Sit here.” And they sat. 
RUT.4.3	And he said to the redeemer, “Naomi, who returned from the countryside of Moab, is selling the tract of land which was for our brother Elimelech. 
RUT.4.4	And I thought I would tell you
RUT.4.5	And Boaz said, “On the day of your acquiring the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the wife of the dead man, in order to raise up for the name of the dead his inheritance.” 
RUT.4.6	And the redeemer said, “I am not able to redeem for myself, lest I ruin my inheritance. You redeem for yourself my kinsman-redemption, for I am not able to redeem it.” 
RUT.4.7	(Now this was the custom in former times
RUT.4.8	So the redeemer said to Boaz, “Acquire it for yourself,” and he removed his sandal. 
RUT.4.9	And Boaz said to the elders and all of the people, “You are witnesses today that I have acquired all that was for Elimelech and that was for Kilion and Mahlon from the hand of Naomi. 
RUT.4.10	And also Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, I have acquired as a wife, to raise up the name of the dead over his inheritance, so that the name of the dead may not be cut off from his relatives and from the gate of his birth place. You are witnesses today.” 
RUT.4.11	And all of the people who were at the gate and the elders said, “We are witnesses. May Yahweh make the woman coming into your house as Rachel and as Leah, who together
RUT.4.12	And may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah from the offspring that Yahweh will give to you from this young woman.” 
RUT.4.13	So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and Yahweh enabled her to conceive,
RUT.4.14	And the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be Yahweh who today did not leave you without a redeemer!
RUT.4.15	He shall be for you a restorer of life and a sustainer in your old age, for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is better for you than seven sons, has borne him.” 
RUT.4.16	And Naomi took the child and she put him on her bosom and became his nurse. 
RUT.4.17	And the women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, “A son has been born to Naomi.” And they called his name Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David. 
RUT.4.18	Now these are the descendants of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron, 
RUT.4.19	and Hezron fathered Ram, and Ram fathered Amminadab, 
RUT.4.20	and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon, 
RUT.4.21	and Salmon fathered Boaz, and Boaz fathered Obed, 
RUT.4.22	and Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David. 
1SA.1.1	There was a certain man from Ramathaim Zophim, from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
1SA.1.2	He had two wives; the name of the first was Hannah, and the name of the second was Peninnah. Now Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 
1SA.1.3	Now this man used to go up from his town year by year
1SA.1.4	On
1SA.1.5	But to Hannah he would give a double portion,
1SA.1.6	(Now her rival wife would provoke her severely in order to upset her because Yahweh had closed her womb.) 
1SA.1.7	And so he used to do
1SA.1.8	So Elkanah her husband would say to her: “Hannah, why do you weep and why do you not eat? And why are you heartsick?
1SA.1.9	Then Hannah got up after eating and drinking at Shiloh. (Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the temple
1SA.1.10	She was deeply troubled,
1SA.1.11	She made a vow
1SA.1.12	While
1SA.1.13	Now Hannah had been speaking in her heart; her lips were moving, but her voice could not be heard, so Eli considered her to be drunk. 
1SA.1.14	Then Eli said to her, “How long will you behave like someone who is drunk? Put away your wine!” 
1SA.1.15	But Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord. I am a woman deeply distressed,
1SA.1.16	Do not regard your female servant as worthless,
1SA.1.17	Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have asked of him.” 
1SA.1.18	And she said, “May your female slave find favor in your sight.” Then the woman went on her way and ate something, and her face did not look sad any longer.
1SA.1.19	Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped before Yahweh and returned
1SA.1.20	In due time,
1SA.1.21	So the man Elkanah went up with all his household to make the annual sacrifice
1SA.1.22	But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “Once the boy is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear before Yahweh; and he will remain there forever.” 
1SA.1.23	So her husband Elkanah said to her, “Do what seems right to you;
1SA.1.24	Then she brought him up with her when she had weaned him, along with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a skin
1SA.1.25	They slaughtered the bull, and they brought the boy to Eli. 
1SA.1.26	She said, “Excuse me, my lord. As you live,
1SA.1.27	I prayed for this boy, and Yahweh has given me my request that I asked from him. 
1SA.1.28	I in turn have lent him to Yahweh. As long as he lives
1SA.2.1	 Then Hannah prayed and said, 
1SA.2.1	“My heart exults in Yahweh, my strength is exalted in Yahweh; I grin
1SA.2.2	There is no one holy like Yahweh, for there is no one besides you, 
1SA.2.2	and there is no rock like our God. 
1SA.2.3	Do not increase speaking very proud
1SA.2.3	Let no arrogance go forth from your mouth, 
1SA.2.3	for Yahweh is a God of knowledge 
1SA.2.3	whose deeds are not weighed.
1SA.2.4	The bows of mighty warriors are shattered, 
1SA.2.4	but those who stumble gird themselves with strength. 
1SA.2.5	Those who were full must hire themselves out for bread, 
1SA.2.5	but those who are hungry will become fat. 
1SA.2.5	As for the infertile, she will bear seven, 
1SA.2.5	but she who has many sons withers away. 
1SA.2.6	Yahweh kills and restores alive, 
1SA.2.6	he brings down to Sheol
1SA.2.7	Yahweh makes poor and makes rich; 
1SA.2.7	he brings low and also exalts. 
1SA.2.8	He raises up the poor from the dust. 
1SA.2.8	From the ash heap he lifts up the needy, 
1SA.2.8	to cause them to sit with noble people 
1SA.2.8	and to cause them to inherit a seat of honor. 
1SA.2.8	For the pillars of the earth belong to Yahweh 
1SA.2.8	and he has set the inhabited world on them. 
1SA.2.9	He will guard the feet of his faithful
1SA.2.9	but the wicked will be destroyed
1SA.2.9	because a man will not prevail by his might. 
1SA.2.10	Yahweh will shatter
1SA.2.10	he will thunder against them in the heavens. 
1SA.2.10	Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth. 
1SA.2.10	He will give strength to his king 
1SA.2.10	and will exalt the might of his anointed one. 
1SA.2.11	Then Elkanah went to Ramah, to his house. Now the boy was serving Yahweh in the presence of
1SA.2.12	Now the sons of Eli were worthless scoundrels;
1SA.2.13	And the custom of the priests with the people was this: When any man brought a sacrifice,
1SA.2.14	and would thrust it into the pan or into the kettle or into the cauldron or into the cooking pot. All that the meat fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they used to do to all of the Israelites who came there at Shiloh. 
1SA.2.15	Also, before they offered up
1SA.2.16	And if the man said to him, “Let them burn the fat completely first,
1SA.2.17	So the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of Yahweh, because the men treated the offering of Yahweh with contempt. 
1SA.2.18	Now Samuel was serving before Yahweh, as a boy wearing a linen ephod. 
1SA.2.19	His mother used to make for him a small robe and take it to him year by year
1SA.2.20	And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and he said, “May Yahweh give you an offspring from this woman in place of the petitioned one that she requested from Yahweh.” Then they went to their home. 
1SA.2.21	Yahweh took note of Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters, while the young man Samuel grew up with Yahweh. 
1SA.2.22	Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel and that they were having sexual relations with the women who were serving at the entrance of the tent of assembly.
1SA.2.23	And he asked them, “Why are you doing all these things that I am hearing, namely, your evil dealings with all these people? 
1SA.2.24	No, my sons, the report is not good that I am hearing the people of Yahweh spreading. 
1SA.2.25	If a man sins against a man, then God can intercede for him. But if a man sins against Yahweh, who can intercede for him?” But they did not obey
1SA.2.26	But the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor
1SA.2.27	Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him: “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Did I not clearly reveal myself to the house of your ancestor
1SA.2.28	And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be a priest to me, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to bear an ephod before me. I gave to the house of your ancestor
1SA.2.29	Why do you despise my sacrifice and my offering which I commanded for my dwelling place, while you honored your sons more than me by making yourselves fat from the best of all the offerings of my people Israel? 
1SA.2.30	Therefore,’ declares
1SA.2.31	Look, days are coming when I will cut off your strength
1SA.2.32	You will look at the distress of my dwelling place, despite all the good caused for Israel, but there will never be an old man in your household forever!
1SA.2.33	The only one I will not cut off from my altar is you.
1SA.2.34	This is the sign for you that will come regarding your two sons Hophni and Phinehas: they will both die on the same day! 
1SA.2.35	But I will raise up for myself a reliable
1SA.2.36	All the remainder of your household will come to bow down before
1SA.3.1	Now the boy Samuel was serving Yahweh in the presence
1SA.3.2	And then
1SA.3.3	and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, Samuel was lying in the temple
1SA.3.4	Then Yahweh called out to Samuel and he said, “Here I am!” 
1SA.3.5	And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.” But he said, “I did not call you. Go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down. 
1SA.3.6	And Yahweh called Samuel again, so Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.” And he said, “I did not call you, my son. Go back and lie down.” 
1SA.3.7	Now Samuel did not yet know Yahweh, and the word of Yahweh had not yet been revealed to him. 
1SA.3.8	Again Yahweh called Samuel a third time, so he got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.” Then Eli realized that Yahweh was calling the boy. 
1SA.3.9	So Eli said to Samuel “Go lie down. If he calls
1SA.3.10	Then Yahweh came and stood there and called out as before,
1SA.3.11	So Yahweh said to Samuel, “Look, I am doing something in Israel which will cause
1SA.3.12	On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken against his household, from beginning to end.
1SA.3.13	I will make him know that I am about to judge his household forever because of the iniquity that he knew, for his sons were bringing curses on themselves,
1SA.3.14	Therefore I swore to the house of Eli that the iniquity of the house of Eli would not be atoned for
1SA.3.15	So Samuel lay down until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of Yahweh, but Samuel was afraid of telling the vision to Eli. 
1SA.3.16	Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!” And he said, “Here I am.” 
1SA.3.17	And he said, “What is the message
1SA.3.18	So Samuel told him all the words and did not conceal anything from him. And he
1SA.3.19	And Samuel grew up, and Yahweh was with him. He did not allow any of his prophecies to go unfulfilled.
1SA.3.20	All Israel from Dan to Beersheba realized that Samuel was faithful
1SA.3.21	And Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh, for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the word of Yahweh. 
1SA.4.1	And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to meet the Philistines for battle, and they encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek. 
1SA.4.2	The Philistines lined up for the battle to meet Israel, and the battle was prolonged
1SA.4.3	When the army
1SA.4.4	So the army sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of hosts who sits between the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. 
1SA.4.5	Now when the ark of the covenant of Yahweh arrived at the camp, all Israel let out a loud shout
1SA.4.6	When the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, “What is the noise of this loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?” Then they learned that the ark of Yahweh had come into the camp. 
1SA.4.7	So the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come
1SA.4.8	Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the same gods who struck the Egyptians with all sorts of plagues in the desert. 
1SA.4.9	Take courage and be men, you Philistines, lest you end up serving the Hebrews just like they have served you. Be men and fight!” 
1SA.4.10	So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated and each man fled to his tent, for the slaughter was very great. Thirty thousand foot soldiers from Israel fell. 
1SA.4.11	Furthermore, the ark of God was captured,
1SA.4.12	A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh that same day, and his clothes were torn and earth was on his head. 
1SA.4.13	When he came, there was
1SA.4.14	When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, “What is the noise of this commotion?” Then the man came quickly
1SA.4.15	Now Eli was ninety-eight years old
1SA.4.16	And the man said to Eli, “I am the one who has come from the battle line! I have fled today from the battle line!” And he said, “What exactly happened,
1SA.4.17	Then the messenger answered and said, “Israel has fled before the Philistines. There has been a great defeat among the troops. Also, your two sons have died, Hophni and Phinehas, and the ark of God has been captured.” 
1SA.4.18	Just as he mentioned the ark of God, he
1SA.4.19	Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and about to give birth. When she heard the news concerning the capture of the ark of God and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she went into labor
1SA.4.20	Just before the time of her death, those attending her
1SA.4.21	She called the boy Ichabod,
1SA.4.22	And she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God was captured.”
1SA.5.1	Now the Philistines had captured
1SA.5.2	Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to the temple of Dagon and placed it beside Dagon. 
1SA.5.3	When the Ashdodites got up early the next morning, there was
1SA.5.4	When they got up early in the morning the next day, there was
1SA.5.5	(Therefore the priests of Dagon and all who come into the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod until this very day.) 
1SA.5.6	Now the hand of Yahweh was heavy against the Ashdodites and he destroyed them and struck them with tumors,
1SA.5.7	The men of Ashdod saw that it was so, and they said, “The ark of the God of Israel should not remain with us, because his hand is harsh on us and on Dagon our god!” 
1SA.5.8	So they sent and gathered all the rulers of the Philistines to them, and they asked, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” And they said, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around toward Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel to Gath. 
1SA.5.9	After they moved it, the hand of Yahweh was against the city, causing a very great confusion, and he struck the men of the city from the youngest to the oldest,
1SA.5.10	So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought around the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our
1SA.5.11	So they sent and gathered all the rulers of the Philistines, and they said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it return to its place, so that it will not kill us and our people.” For a deadly confusion
1SA.5.12	The men who did not die were struck with the tumors,
1SA.6.1	Now the ark of Yahweh had been in the territory of the Philistines for seven months, 
1SA.6.2	and the Philistines called to the priests and to those who practiced divination, saying, “What should we do with the ark of Yahweh? Inform us how we should send it to its place.” 
1SA.6.3	They said, “If you are sending the ark of the God of Israel away, you must not send it away empty, but by all means return it with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will become known to you why his hand is not turned aside from you.” 
1SA.6.4	And they said, “What is the guilt offering that we should return to him?” They said, “The number of the rulers of the Philistines is five. Therefore send five gold tumors
1SA.6.5	You must make images of your tumors
1SA.6.6	Why should you harden your hearts like the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? Is it not just like when he dealt with them wantonly so that they sent them away and they left? 
1SA.6.7	So then, prepare
1SA.6.8	And you must take the ark of Yahweh and place it on the utility cart with the gold objects that you are returning to him as a guilt offering. You must place them in the container
1SA.6.9	You must watch; if it goes up by the way of its territory to Beth Shemesh, he has caused this great disaster to come on us. But if not, then we will know his hand has not struck us; it was by chance that this happened to us. 
1SA.6.10	So the men did so; they took two milking cows and harnessed them to the utility cart, but they shut up their calves in the stall. 
1SA.6.11	Then they put the ark of Yahweh on the utility cart with the container
1SA.6.12	The cows went straight on the way on the road to Beth Shemesh, on the one main road, lowing as they went.
1SA.6.13	Now the people of Beth Shemesh were reaping the wheat harvest in the valley. They lifted their eyes and saw the ark, and they were glad to see it. 
1SA.6.14	The utility cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh and stopped there where there was a large stone. They split the wood of the utility cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to Yahweh. 
1SA.6.15	Then the Levites took down the ark of Yahweh and the container
1SA.6.16	The five rulers of the Philistines saw it and returned to Ekron that same day. 
1SA.6.17	Now these are the gold tumors which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to Yahweh: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron. 
1SA.6.18	And the gold mice according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines, for their five rulers, from the fortified city to the unwalled village of the open country as far as the great stone, where they set
1SA.6.19	He
1SA.6.20	Then the men of Beth Shemesh asked, “Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God? And to whom shall it
1SA.6.21	So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of Yahweh. Come down and take it up to yourselves.” 
1SA.7.1	The men of Kiriath Jearim came and brought up the ark of Yahweh, and they brought it to the house of Abinadab in Gibeah. They consecrated Eleazer his son to guard the ark of Yahweh. 
1SA.7.2	From
1SA.7.3	And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If with all your heart you are turning to Yahweh, remove the foreign gods and Ashtoreths
1SA.7.4	So the Israelites
1SA.7.5	Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to Yahweh for you.” 
1SA.7.6	So they gathered to Mizpah and drew water and poured it out before Yahweh. They fasted on that day and said there, “We have sinned against Yahweh!” So Samuel judged the Israelites
1SA.7.7	Now when the Philistines heard that the Israelites
1SA.7.8	Then the Israelites
1SA.7.9	So Samuel took a single nursing lamb
1SA.7.10	While
1SA.7.11	Then the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and they struck them down as far as below Beth Car. 
1SA.7.12	So Samuel took a single stone and put it between Mizpah and Shen, and he named it Ebenezer and said, “Up to here Yahweh has helped us.” 
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued and they did not come into the territory of Israel again, and the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. 
1SA.7.14	The towns
1SA.7.15	Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
1SA.7.16	He used to go on the circuit from year to year.
1SA.7.17	Then he returned
1SA.8.1	When Samuel grew old he appointed his sons as judges over Israel. 
1SA.8.2	The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba. 
1SA.8.3	But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after gain, they took bribes, and they perverted justice. 
1SA.8.4	So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. 
1SA.8.5	They said to him, “Look, you are old and your sons do not follow in your ways. So then appoint a king for us to judge
1SA.8.6	But the matter was displeasing to Samuel
1SA.8.7	Then Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people concerning all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them. 
1SA.8.8	Like all the deeds they have done from the day I brought them up from Egypt until this day, they have forsaken me and have served other gods—so they are doing to you also. 
1SA.8.9	And so then, listen to their voice. However, you must earnestly warn them; you must explain to them the custom of the king who will rule over them.” 
1SA.8.10	So Samuel spoke all the words of Yahweh to the people who were requesting a king from him. 
1SA.8.11	He said, “This will be the custom of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and his horsemen, and they will run before his chariots. 
1SA.8.12	He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and those to do his plowing
1SA.8.13	He will take your daughters as his perfume makers and as cooks and as bakers. 
1SA.8.14	He will take the best of your fields and your vineyards and your olive trees and will give them to his servants. 
1SA.8.15	He will take a tenth of your seed and your vineyards and give it to his high officials and to his servants. 
1SA.8.16	He will take your male slaves and your female slaves and the best of your young men
1SA.8.17	He will take a tenth of your flocks,
1SA.8.18	So you will cry out on that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but Yahweh will not answer you on that day!” 
1SA.8.19	However, the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel and they said, “No, but there must be a king over us, 
1SA.8.20	so that we also
1SA.8.21	Now when Samuel heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of Yahweh. 
1SA.8.22	Then Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice, and appoint a king for them.” So Samuel spoke to the men of Israel, “Each of you go to his own town.” 
1SA.9.1	Now there was a man from Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjaminite, a very wealthy man.
1SA.9.2	He had a son whose name was Saul,
1SA.9.3	Now the female donkeys of Kish the father of Saul got lost, and Kish said to Saul his son, “Please take one of the servants with you and get up; go and seek the female donkeys.” 
1SA.9.4	So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim; he passed through the land of Shalisha but they did not find them. They passed through the land of Shaalim but they were not there. He passed through the land of Benjamin but did not find them. 
1SA.9.5	When they entered the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us return, lest my father cease caring about the female donkeys and worry about us!” 
1SA.9.6	But he
1SA.9.7	So Saul said to his servant, “Look, we may go, but what should we bring to the man? For the bread is gone from our bags, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have with us?” 
1SA.9.8	The servant again answered Saul and said, “Look, I have
1SA.9.9	(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say: “Come, let us go up to the seer.” For the prophet of today was formerly called a seer.) 
1SA.9.10	So Saul said to his servant, “Your suggestion is a good one.
1SA.9.11	They were going up the ascent of the town when they found young women going out to draw water. They said to them, “Is there the seer here?” 
1SA.9.12	They answered them and said, “There is. Look, he is just in front of you! Hurry now, because he has come to the town today, because there is a sacrifice for the people today at the high place. 
1SA.9.13	As soon as you enter the town, you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice. Then afterward the invited guests will eat. So then, go up, because you will find him today!” 
1SA.9.14	So they went up to the town. As they were entering into the middle of the town, Samuel was coming forth to meet them, to go up to the high place. 
1SA.9.15	Now Yahweh had revealed this to
1SA.9.16	“This time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you must anoint him as leader over my people Israel. He will deliver my people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have seen the suffering of my people, because their cry of distress has come to me.” 
1SA.9.17	When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh answered him, “Here is the man about whom I told you! This is the one who will govern my people.” 
1SA.9.18	Then Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate and said, “Please tell me, where is the house of the seer?” 
1SA.9.19	Samuel answered Saul and said, “I am the seer. Go up ahead of me
1SA.9.20	And as for your female donkeys that were lost three days ago,
1SA.9.21	Saul answered and said, “Am I not a Benjaminite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the humblest of all the families of the tribes of Benjamin? Why do you speak to me in this way?”
1SA.9.22	So Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them to a room in the building and gave them a place at the head of the invited guests.
1SA.9.23	Then Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion that I gave to you, about which I said to you, ‘Keep it with you.’ ” 
1SA.9.24	So the cook took up the shank and what was on it and put it before Saul, and he
1SA.9.25	When they came down from the high place to the town, he spoke with Saul on the roof. 
1SA.9.26	They got up early, and as dawn was breaking,
1SA.9.27	As they were going down to the outskirts of the town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to pass on before us. When he has passed, you stand here a while,
1SA.10.1	Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it over his head and kissed him and said, “Has not
1SA.10.2	As you go from with me today,
1SA.10.3	Then you will go on from there and further you will come to the oak of Tabor. There three men will meet you, who are going up to God at Bethel. One will be carrying three male kid goats, one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and one will be carrying a skin of wine. 
1SA.10.4	They will ask how you are doing
1SA.10.5	After this, you will come to the Gibeah of God,
1SA.10.6	Then the Spirit of Yahweh will rush upon you,
1SA.10.7	When these signs come to you, do for yourself what your hand finds to do, for God will be with you. 
1SA.10.8	Then you will go down before me to Gilgal. Look, I am coming down to you to offer burnt offerings and to make
1SA.10.9	Just as he turned
1SA.10.10	When they went from there to Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God rushed upon him,
1SA.10.11	And when
1SA.10.12	And a man from there responded and said, “And who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb: “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
1SA.10.13	When he finished prophesying, he went to the high place. 
1SA.10.14	Then Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, “To search for the female donkeys; and when we saw none, we went to Samuel.” 
1SA.10.15	So Saul’s uncle said to him, “Please tell me, what did Samuel say to you?” 
1SA.10.16	Then Saul said to his uncle, “He told us for certain that the female donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingship of which Samuel had spoken. 
1SA.10.17	Then Samuel summoned the people to Yahweh at Mizpah, 
1SA.10.18	and he said to the Israelites,
1SA.10.19	But you today have rejected your God who always delivers you from all of your calamities and your distresses. You have said to him, ‘No, but you must appoint a king over us!’ So then present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes and by your clans.” 
1SA.10.20	So Samuel brought near all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected by lot. 
1SA.10.21	Then he brought near the tribe of Benjamin according to its families, and the family of Matri was selected by lot. Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen, and they sought him, but he could not be found. 
1SA.10.22	So they inquired again of Yahweh, “Did the man come here?” 
1SA.10.23	So they ran and took him from there, and when he took his stand among the people, he was taller than all the people from his shoulders and up. 
1SA.10.24	Then Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom Yahweh has chosen? For there is no one like him among all the people!” And all the people shouted and said, “Long live the king!” 
1SA.10.25	Then Samuel told the people the custom of the kingship, and he wrote the rules down on a scroll and laid it before Yahweh. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each to his own house. 
1SA.10.26	And Saul also went to his house at Gibeah, and the troops whose hearts
1SA.10.27	However, some worthless men
1SA.11.1	Now Nahash the Ammonite went up and encamped against Jabesh Gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a treaty with us
1SA.11.2	But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this condition I will make a treaty
1SA.11.3	So the elders of Jabesh said to him, “Leave us alone for seven days so that we may send messengers in all the territory of Israel, and if there is no deliverer for us, then we will come out to you.” 
1SA.11.4	When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, they reported these things to
1SA.11.5	Just then,
1SA.11.6	Then the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and he became very angry.
1SA.11.7	So he took a yoke of oxen and cut them into pieces and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying, “Whoever is not going out after Saul and after Samuel, so will it be done to his oxen.” Then the fear of Yahweh fell on the people and they went out as one man. 
1SA.11.8	He mustered them at Bezek; the Israelites
1SA.11.9	They said to the messengers who had come, “Thus you will say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: ‘Tomorrow deliverance for you will come when the sun is hot.’ ”
1SA.11.10	The men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.”
1SA.11.11	And the
1SA.11.12	Then the people said to Samuel, “Who is the one who asked, ‘Will Saul reign over us?’ Give the men to us that we may kill them.” 
1SA.11.13	But Saul said, “No one will be put to death on this day, because today
1SA.11.14	Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal, and let us renew the kingship there.” 
1SA.11.15	So all the people went to Gilgal and they made Saul king there before Yahweh in Gilgal. They sacrificed fellowship offerings there before Yahweh. Then Saul rejoiced there greatly along with all the men of Israel. 
1SA.12.1	Then Samuel said to all Israel, “Look, I have listened to your voice regarding all that you have said to me, so I have set a king over you. 
1SA.12.2	And so then here is the king walking about before you. Now I am old and gray, but my sons (look at them!) are with you; and I have walked about before you from my youth until this day. 
1SA.12.3	Here I am! Testify against me before Yahweh and before his anointed one! Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I exploited? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe, that I may shut my eyes regarding
1SA.12.4	Then they said, “You have not exploited us or oppressed us, and you have not taken anything from the hand of anyone.” 
1SA.12.5	So he said to them, “Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed one is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” Then they said, “He is witness.” 
1SA.12.6	Then Samuel said to the people, “Yahweh is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your ancestors
1SA.12.7	So then take your stand, so that I may judge you before Yahweh with regard to all the deeds of justice
1SA.12.8	“When Jacob came to Egypt, your ancestors
1SA.12.9	But they forgot Yahweh their God, so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the hosts of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. 
1SA.12.10	So they cried out to Yahweh and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh and have served the Baals
1SA.12.11	So Yahweh sent Jerub-Baal and Bedan
1SA.12.12	“And when you saw that Nahash, the king of the Ammonites,
1SA.12.13	So then look! Here is the king you have chosen, for whom you have asked! Look, Yahweh has placed a king over you! 
1SA.12.14	If you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not be rebellious against what Yahweh says,
1SA.12.15	But, if you do not listen to the voice of Yahweh, and you rebel against what Yahweh says,
1SA.12.16	So then take your stand again and see this great thing that Yahweh is going to do before your eyes. 
1SA.12.17	Is the wheat harvest not today? I will call out to Yahweh so that he still sends thunder and rain, so that you will know and will see that your wickedness is great that you have done in the eyes of Yahweh by asking for a king for yourselves.” 
1SA.12.18	So Samuel called out to Yahweh, and Yahweh brought thunder and rain that same day, so all the people feared Yahweh and Samuel greatly. 
1SA.12.19	Then all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God so that we will not die, because we have added to all our sins by requesting a king for ourselves.” 
1SA.12.20	And Samuel said to the people, “Do not fear! You have done all this evil; only do not turn aside from following
1SA.12.21	And do not turn aside after the triviality,
1SA.12.22	For Yahweh will not forsake his people for the sake of his great name, because Yahweh has decided to make you his own people. 
1SA.12.23	Also, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin
1SA.12.24	Only fear Yahweh and serve him faithfully with all of your heart. For consider what great things he has done for you.
1SA.12.25	But if you continue to do wickedness, both you and your king will be swept away.” 
1SA.13.1	Saul was thirty
1SA.13.2	He chose for himself three thousand from Israel. Two thousand of these were with Saul at Micmash in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. He sent away the rest of the people, each to his tent. 
1SA.13.3	Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines that was at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!” 
1SA.13.4	And all Israel did hear, saying, “Saul has defeated the garrison of the Philistines; and also, Israel has become a stench among the Philistines!” So the people were called out after Saul at Gilgal. 
1SA.13.5	And the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and an army as numerous as sand which is on the seashore. And they came up and encamped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven. 
1SA.13.6	When the men of Israel saw that it was too difficult
1SA.13.7	Some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the army followed him trembling.
1SA.13.8	He waited seven days according to the appointed time Samuel determined, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the army started to slip away from him.
1SA.13.9	So Saul said, “Bring here to me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” Then he offered up the burnt offering. 
1SA.13.10	Just as
1SA.13.11	But Samuel said, “What have you done?” Saul said, “Because I saw that the army was scattering
1SA.13.12	therefore I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not yet implored the face of Yahweh.’ So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering.” 
1SA.13.13	Then Samuel said to Saul, “You have behaved foolishly! You have not kept the command of Yahweh your God which he commanded you. For then, Yahweh would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. 
1SA.13.14	But now, your kingdom will not endure. Yahweh has sought for himself a man according to his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him as leader over his people, because you have not kept what Yahweh commanded you.” 
1SA.13.15	Then Samuel got up and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul mustered the people who were found with him, about six hundred men. 
1SA.13.16	Saul and Jonathan his son and the army that remained with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin, and the Philistines encamped at Micmash. 
1SA.13.17	The raiders
1SA.13.18	One division turned on the road
1SA.13.19	Now no skilled craftsman could be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, “So that the Hebrews cannot make swords or spears for themselves.” 
1SA.13.20	So all Israel went down to the Philistines, each to have his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, and his iron plowshare
1SA.13.21	The charge
1SA.13.22	So
1SA.13.23	Now the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Micmash. 
1SA.14.1	One day
1SA.14.2	Now Saul was staying at the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree that was in Migron, and the troops that were with him were about six hundred men. 
1SA.14.3	Now Ahijah, the son of Ahitub (the brother of Ichabod), the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of Yahweh at Shiloh, was carrying an ephod. The troops did not know that Jonathan had gone. 
1SA.14.4	Now between the passes where Jonathan sought to go over to the garrison of the Philistines there was a crag of rock on one side
1SA.14.5	The one crag on the north was opposite Micmash and the other on the south was opposite Geba. 
1SA.14.6	So Jonathan said to his armor bearer,
1SA.14.7	And his armor bearer
1SA.14.8	Then Jonathan said, “Look, we are about to go over to the men; and we will show ourselves to them. 
1SA.14.9	If they say to us: ‘Wait until we reach you,’ then we will stand as we are
1SA.14.10	But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for Yahweh has given them into our hand, and this will be the sign for us.” 
1SA.14.11	So the two of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, and the Philistines said, “The Hebrews are coming out from the holes in which they have hidden themselves.” 
1SA.14.12	Then the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer,
1SA.14.13	So Jonathan went up on his hands and his feet, with his armor bearer
1SA.14.14	So was the first attack in which Jonathan and his armor bearer
1SA.14.15	Then there was terror
1SA.14.16	And the lookouts of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin saw that
1SA.14.17	Saul said to the troops that were with him, “Please call the roll and see who has gone from us.” So they called the roll and found that
1SA.14.18	Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring near the ark of God”
1SA.14.19	While
1SA.14.20	Then Saul and all the troops who were with him were assembled on command and came up to the battle, and look! Each Philistine’s sword was against his friend; and there was a very great confusion. 
1SA.14.21	The Hebrews who had been for the Philistines previously,
1SA.14.22	All the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, so even they pursued them closely in the battle. 
1SA.14.23	So on that day Yahweh delivered Israel, and the battle shifted to Beth Aven. 
1SA.14.24	Now the men of Israel were hard pressed on that day, because Saul had made the army take an oath, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats any food until evening, when I will have avenged myself on my enemies!” So none of the army tasted any food. 
1SA.14.25	(Now all the people of the land used to go into the forest, for there was honey on the surface of the ground.) 
1SA.14.26	When the army came to the forest, look! There was honey flowing, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the army was afraid of the solemn oath. 
1SA.14.27	However, Jonathan had not heard about the oath of his father with the army, so he extended the end of the staff which was in his hand, and he dipped it into the honeycomb.
1SA.14.28	Then a man from the army informed him and said, “Your father made the army swear a solemn oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food today,’ ” so the army is exhausted. 
1SA.14.29	Then Jonathan said, “My father has brought trouble on the land! See now that my eyes have brightened because I have tasted a little of this honey. 
1SA.14.30	How much more could have been done
1SA.14.31	They defeated the Philistines that day from Micmash to Aijalon, and the troops were very weary. 
1SA.14.32	Then the troops took the plunder: they took sheep and cattle and calves
1SA.14.33	So they reported it to Saul, saying, “Look! The troops are sinning against Yahweh by eating the animals with the blood!” And he said, “You have dealt treacherously! Roll to me a large stone today!”
1SA.14.34	Then Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the troops and say to them, ‘Bring to me each one his ox and each his sheep and slaughter them in this place and eat, but do not sin against Yahweh by eating the animals with the blood.’ ” So all the troops brought them, each leading his ox in his hand that night, and slaughtered it there. 
1SA.14.35	Then Saul built an altar to Yahweh; it was the first altar he built
1SA.14.36	Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and let us plunder them until the morning light, and let us not leave alive a man among them.” So they said, “Do all that is good in your eyes.” But the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.” 
1SA.14.37	So Saul inquired of God, “Should I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?” But he did not answer him on that day. 
1SA.14.38	Then Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the people, so that we find out
1SA.14.39	For as Yahweh lives, who delivers Israel, I swear that even if it is in Jonathan my son, he will certainly die!”
1SA.14.40	Then he said to all Israel, “You will be on one side,
1SA.14.41	Then Saul said to Yahweh the God of Israel, “Render a decision perfectly.”
1SA.14.42	Then Saul said, “Let them cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan,” and Jonathan was chosen. 
1SA.14.43	So Saul said, “Tell me what you have done.” So Jonathan told him and said, “I merely tasted
1SA.14.44	Then Saul said, “So may God do to me and more,
1SA.14.45	But the army said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die, who accomplished this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As Yahweh lives, not a hair from his head will fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the army ransomed Jonathan and he did not die. 
1SA.14.46	Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their place. 
1SA.14.47	So Saul took the kingship over Israel, and he fought all around against his enemies, against Moab, against the Ammonites,
1SA.14.48	He acted bravely and defeated the Amalekites and rescued Israel from the hand of those who plundered it. 
1SA.14.49	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua; the names of his two daughters were as follows: the name of the firstborn was Merab and the younger was Michal. 
1SA.14.50	The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz, and the name of the commander of his army was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle. 
1SA.14.51	Now Kish was the father of Saul, but Ner, the father of Abner, was the son of Abiel. 
1SA.14.52	Warfare was severe against the Philistines all the days of Saul. Whenever Saul saw anyone who was a mighty warrior
1SA.15.1	Then Samuel said to Saul, “Yahweh sent me to anoint you as king over his people Israel. So then, listen to the words
1SA.15.2	Thus says Yahweh of hosts: ‘I have observed what Amalek did to Israel, how he opposed him
1SA.15.3	So then, go and attack Amalek and utterly destroy all that is his! You must not spare him, but kill both man and woman, both child and nursing infant, both ox and sheep, both camel and donkey.’ ” 
1SA.15.4	Saul summoned the army and mustered them at Telaim; two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah. 
1SA.15.5	Then Saul came up to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the wadi.
1SA.15.6	Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, leave! Withdraw from among the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you with them. You have shown loyal love to all the Israelites
1SA.15.7	Then Saul defeated the Amalekites from Havilah as one goes to Shur which is east of
1SA.15.8	He captured Agag the king of Amalek alive, but all the people he utterly destroyed with the edge
1SA.15.9	However, Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and the cattle and the second best of the young fatlings and all that was valuable;
1SA.15.10	Then the word of Yahweh came to Samuel, saying, 
1SA.15.11	“I regret that I made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and has not kept my word.” Samuel became angry,
1SA.15.12	Then Samuel got up early in the morning to meet Saul. Samuel was told, “Saul has gone to Carmel, and look, he is setting up a monument for himself.” Then he turned around and crossed over and went down to Gilgal. 
1SA.15.13	When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, “May you be blessed by Yahweh! I have kept the word of Yahweh.” 
1SA.15.14	But Samuel said, “Then what is this bleating of the sheep that I hear in my ears and the lowing of the cattle that I am hearing?” 
1SA.15.15	Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; the troops spared the best of the sheep and the cattle in order to sacrifice them to Yahweh your God. But the rest we have utterly destroyed.” 
1SA.15.16	Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stop and let me tell you what Yahweh said to me last night.” So he said to him, “Speak.” 
1SA.15.17	Samuel said, “Even though you are small in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh has anointed you as king over Israel. 
1SA.15.18	When Yahweh sent you on your way, he said to you: ‘Go! You must utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and you must fight against them until you
1SA.15.19	Why did you not listen to the voice of Yahweh and fall with shouting on the plunder? You have done evil in the sight of Yahweh!” 
1SA.15.20	Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have listened to the voice of Yahweh, and I have gone on the way that Yahweh sent me! I brought Agag the king of Amalek, and the Amalekites I have utterly destroyed. 
1SA.15.21	The troops took from the plunder, sheep and cattle, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God at Gilgal.” 
1SA.15.22	Then Samuel said, 
1SA.15.22	“Is there as much delight for Yahweh in burnt offerings and sacrifices 
1SA.15.22	as there is in obeying
1SA.15.22	Look! To obey
1SA.15.22	to give heed than the fat of rams. 
1SA.15.23	For rebellion is like the sin of divination; 
1SA.15.23	arrogance is like iniquity and idolatry. 
1SA.15.23	Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, 
1SA.15.23	he has rejected you from being king!” 
1SA.15.24	Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned because I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh
1SA.15.25	So then, please pardon my sin and return with me so that I can worship
1SA.15.26	But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of Yahweh, and he has rejected you from being king over Israel!” 
1SA.15.27	As Samuel turned around to go, he
1SA.15.28	Then Samuel said to him, “Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your neighbor who is better than you.
1SA.15.29	Moreover, the Glory of Israel will not break faith and will not regret, for he is not a human that he should regret.” 
1SA.15.30	Then he
1SA.15.31	So Samuel returned after Saul, and Saul worshiped
1SA.15.32	Then Samuel said, “Bring Agag the king of Amalek out to me!” Agag came to him confidently,
1SA.15.33	Samuel said, 
1SA.15.33	“Just as your sword bereaved women, 
1SA.15.33	so will your mother be bereaved among women!” 
1SA.15.33	Then Samuel hacked Agag to pieces in the presence of Yahweh at Gilgal. 
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel went to Ramah and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul. 
1SA.15.35	Samuel did not see Saul again
1SA.16.1	Then Yahweh said to Samuel, “How long
1SA.16.2	But Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears, he will kill me.” Yahweh said, “You must take a heifer from the herd with you,
1SA.16.3	You will invite Jesse to the sacrifice and I will make known to you what you must do. You will anoint for me the one whom I tell you.” 
1SA.16.4	So Samuel did what Yahweh said. He came to Bethlehem, and the elders of the city came trembling to meet him. They said, “Have you come in peace?”
1SA.16.5	He said, “I come in peace. I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” So he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. 
1SA.16.6	When they came,
1SA.16.7	But Yahweh said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For God does not see what man sees, for a man looks on the outward appearance,
1SA.16.8	Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel, and he said, “This one also Yahweh has not chosen.” 
1SA.16.9	So Jesse made Shammah pass before Samuel, but he said, “Yahweh also has not chosen this one.” 
1SA.16.10	And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not chosen any of these.” 
1SA.16.11	Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all the young men here?”
1SA.16.12	So he sent and brought him. Now he was ruddy with beautiful eyes and of handsome
1SA.16.13	So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. Then the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon David from that day on.
1SA.16.14	Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul and an evil spirit from Yahweh tormented him. 
1SA.16.15	So the servants of Saul said to him, “Look please, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. 
1SA.16.16	Please, let our lord command your servants who are before you! Let them seek a man skilled in playing on the lyre. When
1SA.16.17	So Saul said to his servants, “Please select a man who plays a stringed instrument well
1SA.16.18	One of the servants answered and said, “Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing a stringed instrument, a brave man, a warrior, prudent in speech, and handsome.
1SA.16.19	So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me David your son who is with the sheep.” 
1SA.16.20	And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread and a skin of wine and one young goat
1SA.16.21	So David came to Saul and entered his service.
1SA.16.22	Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand before me, because he has found favor in my sight.”
1SA.16.23	So whenever the evil spirit from God came to Saul, David would take the stringed instrument and play it with his hand. Then it would bring relief
1SA.17.1	The Philistines gathered their camps
1SA.17.2	Then Saul and the men of Israel were gathered and encamped in the valley of Elah, and they formed ranks for the battle to meet the Philistines. 
1SA.17.3	The Philistines were standing on the hill on one side and the army of Israel was standing on the hill on the other side with the valley between them. 
1SA.17.4	Then a champion
1SA.17.5	A bronze helmet was on his head, and he was clothed with scale body armor; the weight of the body armor was five thousand bronze shekels. 
1SA.17.6	Bronze greaves
1SA.17.7	The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam and the point of his spear weighed six hundred iron shekels. His shield bearer
1SA.17.8	He stood and called to the battle lines of Israel and said to them, “Why have you come out to form ranks for battle? Am I not the Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Commission for yourselves a man and let him come down to me. 
1SA.17.9	If he is able to fight with me and he defeats me, then we will be your servants; but if I prevail over him and defeat him, then you will be our servants and you will serve us.” 
1SA.17.10	Then the Philistine said, “I hereby defy the battle lines of Israel today! Give me a man so that we may fight each other!” 
1SA.17.11	When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and very afraid. 
1SA.17.12	Now David was the son of an Ephrathite. This man was from Bethlehem of Judah, and his name was Jesse. He had
1SA.17.13	The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone and followed
1SA.17.14	Now David was the youngest. The three oldest followed
1SA.17.15	but David went back and forth
1SA.17.16	Now the Philistine came forward early and late, and he took his stand for forty days. 
1SA.17.17	Then Jesse said to his son David, “Please take for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread, and bring them quickly to the camp for your brothers. 
1SA.17.18	And these ten portions of cheese you will bring to the commander of the thousand; find out how your brothers are doing,
1SA.17.19	Now Saul and they
1SA.17.20	David rose early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper, and he took the provisions and went as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the encampment while the troops were going to the battle line, and they raised the war cry. 
1SA.17.21	Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle lines, one battle line against the other.
1SA.17.22	David left the baggage he had with him in the care
1SA.17.23	While he was speaking to them, the champion,
1SA.17.24	When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from his presence and were very afraid. 
1SA.17.25	And the men of Israel said, “Did you see this man who has come up? For he is going up to defy Israel! It will be that the man who defeats him, the king will make him
1SA.17.26	Now David had spoken to the men who were standing with him, saying, “What will be done for the man who defeats this Philistine and removes the disgrace from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he defies the battle lines of the living God?” 
1SA.17.27	And the troops had spoken to him according to this word, saying, “So it will be done for the man who defeats
1SA.17.28	His oldest brother Eliab heard while he was speaking to the men, and Eliab became very angry against David
1SA.17.29	David replied, “What have I done now? I merely asked a question!
1SA.17.30	He turned around from him to another opposite him and he spoke to him in the same way,
1SA.17.31	Now the words which David had spoken were heard and they reported them to
1SA.17.32	David said to Saul, “Do not let anyone’s heart fail concerning him! Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” 
1SA.17.33	But Saul said to David, “You will not be able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, because you are only a boy, whereas he has been a man of war since his childhood!” 
1SA.17.34	And David said to Saul, “Your servant has been a shepherd of the flock for his father. If the lion or the bear would come and carry off a sheep from the group, 
1SA.17.35	I would go out after it and strike it down and rescue the sheep from its mouth. If it rose against me, I would grab it by its beard and strike it down and kill it. 
1SA.17.36	Your servant has struck down both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he defied the battle lines of the living God.” 
1SA.17.37	And David said, “Yahweh, who rescued me from the hand of the lion and from the hand of the bear, will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine!” Then Saul said to David, “Go and may Yahweh be with you!” 
1SA.17.38	Then Saul clothed David with his own fighting attire and put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him with body armor. 
1SA.17.39	Then David strapped on his sword over his fighting attire, but he tried in vain to walk around, for he was not trained to use them. So David said to Saul, “I am not able to walk with these, because I am not trained to use them.” So David removed them. 
1SA.17.40	Then he took his staff in his hand, picked out for himself five smooth stones from the wadi,
1SA.17.41	Then the Philistine came on, getting nearer and nearer
1SA.17.42	When the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him, for he was only a boy and ruddy with a handsome appearance. 
1SA.17.43	So the Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you are coming to me with sticks?” Then the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
1SA.17.44	The Philistine said to David, “Come to me so that I can give your flesh to the birds of heaven and to the wild animals of the field!” 
1SA.17.45	Then David said to the Philistine, “You are coming to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I am coming to you in the name of Yahweh of hosts, the God of the battle lines of Israel, whom you have defied! 
1SA.17.46	This day Yahweh will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head!
1SA.17.47	And all of this assembly will know that Yahweh does not rescue with sword or with spear, for the battle belongs to Yahweh, and he will give you into our hands!” 
1SA.17.48	When
1SA.17.49	Then David put his hand into the bag and took a stone from it and slung it. He struck the Philistine on his forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground. 
1SA.17.50	So David prevailed over the Philistine with the sling and with the stone, and he struck down the Philistine and killed him, but there was no sword in David’s hand. 
1SA.17.51	Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it from its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. 
1SA.17.52	The men of Israel and Judah got up, raised the war cry, and pursued the Philistines as far as
1SA.17.53	Then the Israelites
1SA.17.54	And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem and placed his weapons in his tent. 
1SA.17.55	Now when Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Whose son is this young man, Abner?” And Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.” 
1SA.17.56	Then the king said, “You inquire whose son this young man is.” 
1SA.17.57	So when David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul. The head of the Philistine was in his hand. 
1SA.17.58	Then Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David said, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.” 
1SA.18.1	When
1SA.18.2	Saul took him on that very day and did not allow him to return to his father’s house. 
1SA.18.3	Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul. 
1SA.18.4	Jonathan stripped off the robe that he was wearing
1SA.18.5	David went out whenever
1SA.18.6	When they were coming back
1SA.18.7	And the women sang as they danced, and they said, 
1SA.18.7	“Saul has struck down his thousands, 
1SA.18.7	but David his ten thousands!” 
1SA.18.8	Saul became very angry,
1SA.18.9	So Saul was watching
1SA.18.10	On
1SA.18.11	Then Saul hurled the spear and thought, “I will pin David to the wall.”
1SA.18.12	Now Saul was threatened by the presence of David
1SA.18.13	So Saul removed him from his presence,
1SA.18.14	And David was achieving success in all his ways and Yahweh was with him, 
1SA.18.15	but when Saul saw that he was very successful, he was severely threatened by him.
1SA.18.16	However, all of Israel and Judah were loving David, for he was going forth and marching ahead of them. 
1SA.18.17	Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you as your wife. Only be a brave warrior
1SA.18.18	But David said to Saul, “Who am I, and who are my relatives, the clan of my father in Israel, that I should be a son-in-law to the king?” 
1SA.18.19	But
1SA.18.20	Now Saul’s daughter Michal loved David, so they told Saul, and the matter pleased him.
1SA.18.21	And Saul thought, “I will give her to him, so that she may be a snare for him and the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David, “For a second time you can become my son-in-law today.” 
1SA.18.22	Then Saul commanded his servants, “Speak to David in secret, saying, ‘Look, the king is pleased with you, and all his servants love you. So then, become a son-in-law of the king.’ ” 
1SA.18.23	And Saul’s servants spoke these words to David privately.
1SA.18.24	So the servants of Saul informed him, saying, “This is what David said.”
1SA.18.25	Then Saul said, “This is what you must say to David: ‘The king desires no bride price
1SA.18.26	So his servants told David these words, and the matter pleased David
1SA.18.27	And David got up, and he and his men went and struck down two hundred men of the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they presented the full number
1SA.18.28	When Saul realized
1SA.18.29	Saul was threatened by David still more,
1SA.18.30	Then the commanders of the Philistines went out for battle, and as often as they went out, David succeeded more than all the servants of Saul, and his name became very esteemed. 
1SA.19.1	Now Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants about killing David, but Saul’s son Jonathan liked David very much.
1SA.19.2	So Jonathan informed David, saying, “My father Saul is trying to kill you; now please take care! In the morning you should stay in the hiding place and conceal yourself. 
1SA.19.3	I will go out and stand at my father’s side
1SA.19.4	So Jonathan spoke well about David to his father Saul and said to him, “The king should not sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his service for you has been very good. 
1SA.19.5	He put his life in his hand and attacked the Philistine, and Yahweh brought about a great victory for all of Israel, and you saw it and rejoiced! Now why should you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause?” 
1SA.19.6	And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan and swore, “As Yahweh lives,
1SA.19.7	Jonathan called to David and told him all of these words. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul and he was before him as formerly.
1SA.19.8	War came again, so David went out and fought against the Philistines and defeated them thoroughly
1SA.19.9	Then the evil spirit from Yahweh came upon Saul while he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. And David was playing a stringed instrument in his hand. 
1SA.19.10	So Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear,
1SA.19.11	Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house to guard him and to kill him in the morning, but Michal his wife told David, saying, “If you do not save your life
1SA.19.12	So Michal lowered David through the window, and he went and fled and escaped. 
1SA.19.13	Then Michal took the household god
1SA.19.14	And Saul sent messengers to arrest David, but she said, “He is ill.” 
1SA.19.15	So Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, so that I can kill him.” 
1SA.19.16	When the messengers came, to their surprise
1SA.19.17	Then Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this and sent away my enemy, so that he escaped?” Michal said to Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go, why should I kill you?’ ” 
1SA.19.18	So David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth. 
1SA.19.19	And it was told to Saul, “David is in Naioth in Ramah.” 
1SA.19.20	So Saul sent messengers to capture David. When they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and Samuel standing as chief over them, then the Spirit of God came upon Saul’s messengers, and they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.21	So they told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Again Saul sent messengers a third time, and they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.22	Then he also went to Ramah. When he came to the great cistern which was in Secu, he asked and said, “Where are Samuel and David?” Someone said, “Look they are in Naioth in Ramah.” 
1SA.19.23	So he went there to Naioth in Ramah and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he walked along prophesying
1SA.19.24	He also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel. He lay naked all that day and all night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
1SA.20.1	Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said before Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my guilt and what is my sin before your father that he is trying to kill me?
1SA.20.2	And he said to him, “Far from it! You will not die! Look, my father does not do
1SA.20.3	Then David took an oath
1SA.20.4	Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you wish,
1SA.20.5	David said to Jonathan, “Look, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should certainly sit with the king to eat. You must send me away so that I can hide myself in the field until the third evening. 
1SA.20.6	If your father misses me at all, then you must say, ‘David earnestly asked from me to run to Bethlehem his city, for the yearly sacrifice
1SA.20.7	If he says ‘Good,’ it will mean peace for your servant; but if he is very angry, know that he has decided to do me harm.
1SA.20.8	So you must show loyal love to your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you. But if there is guilt in me, then kill me yourself! But why should you bring me to your father?” 
1SA.20.9	Then Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! For if I know for certain that my father decided evil should come upon you,
1SA.20.10	Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if what your father answers you is harsh?” 
1SA.20.11	And Jonathan said to David, “Come, let us go out to the field.” So the two of them went out to the field. 
1SA.20.12	Then Jonathan said to David, “Yahweh the God of Israel is my witness
1SA.20.13	So may Yahweh punish Jonathan and more
1SA.20.14	And not while I am still alive, will you not show the loyal love of Yahweh with me, that I may not die?
1SA.20.15	And do not cut off your loyal love from my family
1SA.20.16	So Jonathan made a covenant
1SA.20.17	And Jonathan again made David swear an oath, because he loved him; for with the love of his soul he loved him. 
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, for your seat will stay empty. 
1SA.20.19	On the third day you must go down quickly and go to the place where you hid yourself on the day all this started
1SA.20.20	I will shoot three arrows to the side as if I were shooting at a target. 
1SA.20.21	Then
1SA.20.22	But if I say this to the young man, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’
1SA.20.23	And as for the matter about which you and I spoke, look, Yahweh is between you and me forever.” 
1SA.20.24	So David hid himself in the field. When the new moon came,
1SA.20.25	The king sat at his seat as before,
1SA.20.26	But Saul said nothing on that day, for he thought, “Something happened to him.
1SA.20.27	And then
1SA.20.28	Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked permission from me to go up to Bethlehem. 
1SA.20.29	He said, ‘Send me away, please, for our clan sacrifice is in the city, and my brother commanded
1SA.20.30	Then Saul became angry
1SA.20.31	For as long as
1SA.20.32	But Jonathan answered his father Saul and said to him, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” 
1SA.20.33	Then Saul hurled his
1SA.20.34	Jonathan got up from the table enraged,
1SA.20.35	And then
1SA.20.36	He said to his servant,
1SA.20.37	When the boy came up to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called out after the boy and said, “Is not the arrow beyond you?”
1SA.20.38	Then Jonathan called out after the boy, “Quick, hurry, do not linger!” And Jonathan’s servant collected the arrows and came to his master. 
1SA.20.39	But the boy did not know anything about this; only Jonathan and David knew the matter. 
1SA.20.40	Jonathan gave his weapons to his servant and said to him, “Go, bring them to the city.” 
1SA.20.41	The boy left, and then David got up from the south side,
1SA.20.42	Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, because we have sworn, the two of us, an oath in the name of Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh will be between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring forever.”
1SA.21.1	Now David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech came trembling to meet David, and he said to him, “Why are you alone and there are no men with you?” 
1SA.21.2	So David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king charged me with a matter and said to me, ‘No one must know anything about this matter on which I am sending you, with which I have charged you and the servants.’ ” So I have arranged to meet with my servants at a certain place.
1SA.21.3	Now then, what do you have at hand?
1SA.21.4	The priest answered David and said, “There is no ordinary bread here at hand;
1SA.21.5	David answered the priest and said to him, “Indeed, women were held back from us as it has been when I’ve gone out before.
1SA.21.6	So the priest gave him the holy bread, for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence, which was removed from before Yahweh, in order to set hot bread there on the day when it was taken away. 
1SA.21.7	Now there was a man from the servants of Saul on that day, detained before Yahweh, whose name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul’s shepherds. 
1SA.21.8	David asked Ahimelech, “Is there not at your disposal
1SA.21.9	So the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine whom you killed in the valley of Elah is here, wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want to take it for yourself, then take it, for there is no other except it here.” And David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.” 
1SA.21.10	So David got up and fled on that day from the presence of Saul, and he came to Achish the king of Gath. 
1SA.21.11	The servants of Achish said to him, “Is not this David the king of the land? Is it not for this one that they sang in the dances, saying, ‘Saul killed his thousands, but David his ten thousands?’ ” 
1SA.21.12	David took these words seriously
1SA.21.13	So he changed his behavior before them
1SA.21.14	Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see a madman! Why did you bring him to me? 
1SA.21.15	Do I lack madmen that you have brought this one to act like a madman before me? Should this one enter my household?” 
1SA.22.1	David went from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s household
1SA.22.2	Every man in distress and every man who had a creditor and every embittered man gathered to him, and he became their commander.
1SA.22.3	And David went up from there to Mizpah of Moab. He said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother stay
1SA.22.4	So he brought them before the king of Moab,
1SA.22.5	Then Gad the prophet said to David, “You should not stay in the stronghold; leave and go into the land of Judah.” So David left and came to the forest of Hereth. 
1SA.22.6	Now Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been located. Saul was sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree at Ramah. Now his spear was in his hand and all his servants were stationed around him. 
1SA.22.7	Then Saul said to the servants who were standing around him, “Please listen, Benjaminites!
1SA.22.8	For all of you have conspired against me, and no one discloses to me
1SA.22.9	But Doeg the Edomite, who was stationed among the servants of Saul, answered and said, “I saw the son of Jesse going to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 
1SA.22.10	And he inquired of Yahweh for him and gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.” 
1SA.22.11	So the king sent to summon Ahimelech the son of Ahitub the priest, and all his father’s household, the priests who were at Nob. So all of them came to the king. 
1SA.22.12	Saul said, “Listen please, son of Ahitub.” He said, “Here I am, my lord.” 
1SA.22.13	Then Saul said to him, “Why did you conspire against me, you and the son of Jesse, when you gave to him bread and a sword, and by inquiring of God for him so that he might arise against me to ambush me as has been done this day?” 
1SA.22.14	But Ahimelech answered the king and said, “And who among all your servants is as faithful as David? He is the son-in-law of the king who moves quickly to safeguard you and is honored in your house. 
1SA.22.15	Only today I began to inquire of God for him. Far be it from me that the king should impute anything against his servant
1SA.22.16	Then the king said, “You must certainly die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s household!” 
1SA.22.17	So the king said to the runners who were stationed around him, “Turn and kill the priests of Yahweh, because they also support David
1SA.22.18	Then the king said to Doeg, “You turn and attack the priests!” So Doeg the Edomite turned and attacked the priests himself, and on that day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod. 
1SA.22.19	And he put to the sword
1SA.22.20	But, one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, whose name was Abiathar, escaped and fled after David. 
1SA.22.21	Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of Yahweh. 
1SA.22.22	Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day that Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would certainly tell Saul. I am responsible for the deaths of all your father’s household!
1SA.22.23	Stay with me! Do not fear, because he who seeks my life seeks your life. You are in good care with me.” 
1SA.23.1	Now they told David, “Look, the Philistines are fighting in Keilah and they are raiding the threshing floors.” 
1SA.23.2	So David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?” And Yahweh said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines and save
1SA.23.3	But David’s men said to him, “Look, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more
1SA.23.4	So David again inquired of Yahweh, and Yahweh answered him and said, “Get up, go down to Keilah, for I am giving the Philistines into your hand.” 
1SA.23.5	So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines. They drove off their livestock and dealt them a heavy blow.
1SA.23.6	Now when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled
1SA.23.7	When it was told to Saul that David had gone to Keilah, Saul said, “God has given him
1SA.23.8	Saul then summoned all of the army for the battle, to go down to Keilah to lay a siege against David and his men. 
1SA.23.9	When David learned that Saul was plotting evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.” 
1SA.23.10	And David said, “O Yahweh, God of Israel, your servant has clearly heard that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah to destroy the city because of me. 
1SA.23.11	Will the rulers of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O Yahweh, God of Israel, please tell your servant!” And Yahweh said, “He will come down.” 
1SA.23.12	Then David said, “Will the rulers of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And Yahweh said, “They will deliver you.” 
1SA.23.13	So David and his men got up, about six hundred men, and went out from Keilah and wandered wherever they could go. When it was told to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he stopped his pursuit.
1SA.23.14	David remained in the wilderness, in the strongholds, and in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him continually,
1SA.23.15	When David realized that Saul had gone out to seek his life, David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh. 
1SA.23.16	So Jonathan the son of Saul got up and went to David at Horesh, and encouraged him
1SA.23.17	He said to him, “Do not be afraid, for the hand of my father Saul will not find you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you.
1SA.23.18	Then the two of them made
1SA.23.19	Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh on the hill of Hakilah, which is south of Jeshimon? 
1SA.23.20	So then, O king, whenever you want
1SA.23.21	And Saul said to them, “May you be blessed by Yahweh, for you have shown me compassion! 
1SA.23.22	Go, please, make certain again! Find out and see exactly where he is
1SA.23.23	Look, find out all of the hiding places where he hides. Then return to me with dependable information,
1SA.23.24	Then they got up and went to Ziph before Saul. 
1SA.23.24	Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon in the Arabah, to the south of Jeshimon. 
1SA.23.25	And Saul and his men went to seek him, and they told David, so he went down to the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard this, he pursued David into the wilderness of Maon. 
1SA.23.26	Saul went on one side of the mountain,
1SA.23.27	But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, because the Philistines have made a raid on the land!” 
1SA.23.28	So Saul returned from pursuing David, and he went to confront
1SA.23.29	 David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of En Gedi. 
1SA.24.1	When Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, they told him, “Look, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi.” 
1SA.24.2	So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel, and he and his men went to search for David in the direction of
1SA.24.3	He came to the sheep pens beside the road, and a cave was there. Then Saul went in to relieve himself.
1SA.24.4	And David’s men said to him, “Look, today is the day about which Yahweh said to you, ‘See, I am giving your enemy
1SA.24.5	And then
1SA.24.6	He said to his men, “Far be it from me in
1SA.24.7	So David rebuked his men with the words and did not allow them to rise against Saul. And Saul got up from the cave, and he went on his
1SA.24.8	Then David got up afterward and went out of the cave and called after Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked after him, David knelt down with his face to the ground and bowed down. 
1SA.24.9	Then David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of people who say: ‘Look, David is seeking to do you harm’?
1SA.24.10	Look, this day your eyes have seen that Yahweh gave you today into my hand in the cave, and some said to kill you. But I took pity
1SA.24.11	Now, my father, see, yes, see, the hem of your robe in my hand! For when I cut
1SA.24.12	May Yahweh judge between me and you, and may Yahweh avenge me on you, but my hand will not be against you! 
1SA.24.13	Just as the ancient proverb says, ‘From the wicked, wickedness goes out,’ but my hand will not be against you! 
1SA.24.14	After whom did the king of Israel go out? After whom are you pursuing? After a dead dog? After one flea? 
1SA.24.15	May Yahweh be the judge, and let him judge between me and you, and may he see and plead my case. May he vindicate me against you!”
1SA.24.16	When David finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And Saul lifted up his voice and wept. 
1SA.24.17	Then he said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me the good, but I have repaid you the evil. 
1SA.24.18	You have explained to me today that you have dealt well with me, how
1SA.24.19	For a man has found his enemy but sent him on his way safely. Now may Yahweh reward you with good in return for this day, for what you have done for me. 
1SA.24.20	So now then, look, I know that you will certainly be king and the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand. 
1SA.24.21	So then, swear to me by Yahweh that you will not cut off my descendants
1SA.24.22	So David swore this on oath to Saul, and Saul went to his house, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. 
1SA.25.1	Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him. They buried him at his house at Ramah. Then David got up and went down to the wilderness of Paran. 
1SA.25.2	Now there was a man in Maon, whose business was in Carmel. The man was very rich and owned
1SA.25.3	The name of the man was Nabal,
1SA.25.4	David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 
1SA.25.5	So David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel and go to Nabal; you will greet him in my name.
1SA.25.6	Then you must say to him, ‘Long life to you, and may it go well with you, with your house, and with all that is yours.
1SA.25.7	Now I have heard that you have shearers.
1SA.25.8	Ask your servants
1SA.25.9	So David’s young men came and they spoke all these words to Nabal in the name of David. Then they waited. 
1SA.25.10	But Nabal answered David’s servants and said, “Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? Today, there are many servants breaking away from the presence of their masters. 
1SA.25.11	Should I take my bread and my water and my meat which I have slaughtered for my shearers and give it to men whom I do not know where they are from? 
1SA.25.12	So David’s young men turned on their way and returned and came and told him according to all these words. 
1SA.25.13	Then David said to his men, “Each man strap on his sword!” So each one strapped on his sword, and David also strapped on his sword. About four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred remained with the baggage. 
1SA.25.14	But a young man of the servants told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Look, David sent messengers from the desert to greet
1SA.25.15	even though the men were very good to us; we were not mistreated and did not miss anything all the days we went about with them while we were
1SA.25.16	They were a wall to us both night and day, all the days we were
1SA.25.17	And so then, know and consider
1SA.25.18	Then Abigail quickly took
1SA.25.19	Then she said to her servants, “Go ahead before me; look, I am coming after you,” but she did not tell her husband Nabal. 
1SA.25.20	And then,
1SA.25.21	Now David had said, “Surely in vain
1SA.25.22	May God severely punish the enemies of David
1SA.25.23	When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got down from the donkey and fell on her face before David’s anger,
1SA.25.24	She fell at his feet and said, “On me, my lord, be the guilt! Please let your female servant speak to you personally!
1SA.25.25	Please do not let my lord set his heart against this worthless man,
1SA.25.26	So then, my lord, as Yahweh lives and as your soul lives,
1SA.25.27	So then, this gift which your female servant has brought to my lord, may it be given to the young men who follow my lord.
1SA.25.28	Please forgive the transgression of your female servant, because Yahweh will certainly make a lasting house
1SA.25.29	Should a man arise to pursue you and to seek your life, may the life of my lord be wrapped in the pouch
1SA.25.30	And then
1SA.25.31	then this will not be an obstacle for you or a stumbling block of conscience for my lord either by the shedding of blood without cause or by my lord taking matters into his own hands.
1SA.25.32	Then David said to Abigail, “Blessed be Yahweh the God of Israel who has sent you this day to meet me! 
1SA.25.33	And blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you who have prevented me this day from bloodguilt and from delivering myself by my own hand. 
1SA.25.34	But as Yahweh lives,
1SA.25.35	Then David took from her hand what she had brought for him, and he said to her, “Go up to your house in peace. See, I have listened to your voice, and I have granted your request.”
1SA.25.36	Then Abigail went to Nabal, and look, he was holding a feast
1SA.25.37	And then
1SA.25.38	And then,
1SA.25.39	When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, “Blessed be Yahweh who has vindicated the case of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and he has kept back his servant from evil; but Yahweh has returned the evil of Nabal on his own head.” Then David sent and spoke with Abigail to take her for his wife. 
1SA.25.40	So the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, and they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you to take you for his wife.” 
1SA.25.41	She got up and bowed down with her face to the ground and said, “Here is your female servant, as a slave to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.” 
1SA.25.42	Then Abigail quickly got up
1SA.25.43	David had also taken Ahinoam from Jezreel, and both of them became his wives. 
1SA.25.44	(Now Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim.) 
1SA.26.1	The Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah opposite Jeshimon?” 
1SA.26.2	Then Saul got up and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. 
1SA.26.3	Now Saul was on the hill of Hakilah, which is opposite Jeshimon by the road, but David was staying in the wilderness. When he realized that Saul had come to the wilderness after him, 
1SA.26.4	David sent spies, and he learned that Saul had come for certain.
1SA.26.5	Then David got up and came to the place where Saul had encamped, and David saw the place where Saul was lying down, as well as
1SA.26.6	David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah the brother of Joab, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul, in the camp?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.” 
1SA.26.7	So David and Abishai came to the army by night, and there was
1SA.26.8	Then Abishai said to David, “God has handed over your enemy into your hand today! So then, please let me pin him to the ground with the spear
1SA.26.9	But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy
1SA.26.10	And David said, “As Yahweh lives,
1SA.26.11	Yahweh forbid me
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and the jar of water from near Saul’s head, and they went away. No one saw, no one knew, and no one awakened,
1SA.26.13	Then David went to the other side and stood on the top of the hill at a distance; the distance was great between them. 
1SA.26.14	David called out to the army and to Abner the son of Ner, “Will you not answer, Abner?” And Abner answered and said, “Who are you that you call to the king?” 
1SA.26.15	So David said to Abner, “Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? Why did you not keep watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy
1SA.26.16	This thing that you have done is not good. As Yahweh lives,
1SA.26.17	Then Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And David said, “It is my voice, my lord the king.” 
1SA.26.18	Then he said, “Why is my lord pursuing after his servant? For what have I done? And what evil is in my hand? 
1SA.26.19	And so then, please let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant: If Yahweh has incited you against me, may he delight in an offering; but if it is mortals,
1SA.26.20	And so then, do not let my blood fall to the ground away from
1SA.26.21	Then Saul said, “I have sinned! Come back, David my son, for I will not harm you again, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Look, I have acted like a fool and have made a terrible mistake.”
1SA.26.22	David answered and said, “Here is the king’s spear; let one of the young men
1SA.26.23	Yahweh repays to each one his righteousness and his faithfulness, for Yahweh gave you into my hand today, but I was not willing to stretch out my hand against Yahweh’s anointed. 
1SA.26.24	Look, as your life was precious in my eyes this day, may my life be great in the eyes of Yahweh, and may he rescue me from all trouble.” 
1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to David, “Blessed are you, my son David; you will not only do many things, but also will always succeed!”
1SA.27.1	Then David thought to himself,
1SA.27.2	So David got up and crossed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, the king of Gath. 
1SA.27.3	David settled with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each with his household.
1SA.27.4	And it was reported to Saul that David had fled to Gath, so he no longer searched for him.
1SA.27.5	Then David said to Achish, “Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, then let them give me a place in one of the country towns
1SA.27.6	So Achish gave him Ziklag on that day. (Therefore, Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah until this day.) 
1SA.27.7	The number of days that David lived in the countryside of the Philistines was one year and four months. 
1SA.27.8	Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites, for they had been living in the land for a long time in the direction of
1SA.27.9	So David struck the land and did not leave a man or a woman alive; he took the sheep,
1SA.27.10	And Achish said, “Against whom have you raided today?” David said, “Against the Negev of Judah and against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites and against the Negev of the Kenites.” 
1SA.27.11	And David did not leave alive a man or a woman to bring them back to Gath, thinking,
1SA.27.12	And Achish trusted David, saying, “He has made himself utterly hated
1SA.28.1	 Now
1SA.28.2	David said to Achish, “Very well, you will know what your servant can do.” Achish said to David, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard
1SA.28.3	(Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him, and they had buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had expelled the mediums
1SA.28.4	Then the Philistines assembled and came and encamped at Shunem, so Saul assembled all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly. 
1SA.28.6	And Saul inquired of Yahweh, but Yahweh did not answer him, not by dreams or by the Urim
1SA.28.7	So Saul said to his servants, “Search for me a woman who is a medium
1SA.28.8	So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes, and he went with two of his men.
1SA.28.9	But the woman said to him, “Look, you know what Saul did, how he exterminated the mediums
1SA.28.10	Then Saul swore to her by Yahweh, “As Yahweh lives,
1SA.28.11	So the woman asked, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” He said, “Bring up Samuel for me.” 
1SA.28.12	When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice, and the woman said to Saul, “Why did you deceive me? You are Saul!” 
1SA.28.13	The king said to her, “Do not be afraid! What do you see?” And the woman said to Saul, “I see a god
1SA.28.14	Then he said to her, “What is his appearance?” She said, “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe.”
1SA.28.15	Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” And Saul said, “I am in distress!
1SA.28.16	Then Samuel said, “Why do you ask me, since Yahweh has turned away from you and has become your enemy? 
1SA.28.17	Yahweh has done to you just as he spoke by my hand! Yahweh has torn the kingdom from your hand and has given it to your neighbor, to David. 
1SA.28.18	Because you did not obey
1SA.28.19	And Yahweh will also give Israel with you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me, and Yahweh will also give the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.” 
1SA.28.20	Then Saul immediately fell prostrate
1SA.28.21	Then the woman came to Saul and realized that he was absolutely
1SA.28.22	So then, you also please listen to the voice of your female servant, and let me set before you a morsel of bread, and you eat so that you will have strength
1SA.28.23	But he refused and said, “I will not eat!” However, his servants urged him, and the woman also. So he listened to what they said,
1SA.28.24	Now the woman had a fattened bull calf in the house, so she quickly slaughtered it
1SA.28.25	She brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they got up and went away that very night. 
1SA.29.1	Now the Philistines assembled all their forces at Aphek, and Israel was encamped at the spring that is in Jezreel. 
1SA.29.2	The rulers of the Philistines were passing on according to hundreds and thousands, David and his men passing on at the rear with Achish. 
1SA.29.3	Then the commanders of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, “Is this not David, the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, who has been with me for days and years?
1SA.29.4	But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him and they said to him, “Send the man back so that he might return to his place where you have assigned him! But he will not go down with us into the battle, so that he does not become an adversary to us in the battle. By what could this fellow make himself favorable to his lord? Is it not with the heads of these men? 
1SA.29.5	Is this not David about whom they sing in the dances, saying, 
1SA.29.5	‘Saul has killed his thousands, 
1SA.29.5	but David his ten thousands’?” 
1SA.29.6	So Achish called David and said to him, “As Yahweh lives,
1SA.29.7	So then, return and go in peace, so that you do not do something that displeases
1SA.29.8	Then David said to Achish, “But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant from the day that I entered your service
1SA.29.9	And Achish answered and said to David, “I know that you are good in my eyes, like an angel of God! However, the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go up with us into the battle.’ 
1SA.29.10	So then, rise early in the morning, you and the servants of your lord who came with you. When you rise early in the morning and it is light enough for you, leave. 
1SA.29.11	So David set out early, he and his men, to leave in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines, but the Philistines went up to Jezreel. 
1SA.30.1	Now
1SA.30.2	They took captive the women
1SA.30.3	When David and his men came to the city, they saw,
1SA.30.4	Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until there was not enough strength in them to weep. 
1SA.30.5	Two of David’s wives had been taken captive. Ahinoam from Jezreel
1SA.30.6	And David was in a very precarious situation,
1SA.30.7	Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring the ephod here for me.” So Abiathar brought the ephod to David. 
1SA.30.8	And David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Should I pursue after this band of raiders? Will I overtake them?” He said to him, “Pursue them, for you will certainly overtake them, and you will certainly rescue them.” 
1SA.30.9	So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and they came to the Wadi
1SA.30.10	David pursued, he and four hundred men; but two hundred men stayed because they were too exhausted to pass over the Wadi Besor. 
1SA.30.11	Then they found an Egyptian man in the open country and brought him to David, and they gave him food and he ate; they also gave him water. 
1SA.30.12	They gave him a slice of fig cake and two raisin cakes; he ate and this revived him,
1SA.30.13	Then David said to him, “To whom do you belong,
1SA.30.14	We raided the Negev of the Kerethites and that which belongs to Judah and then the Negev of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.” 
1SA.30.15	So David asked him, “Will you take me down to this band of raiders?” He said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me and that you will not deliver me into my master’s hand! Then I will take you down to this band.” 
1SA.30.16	So he took him down, and there they were,
1SA.30.17	Then David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped except
1SA.30.18	So David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; David also rescued his two wives. 
1SA.30.19	None of theirs was missing from the smallest to the greatest,
1SA.30.20	And David took all of the sheep,
1SA.30.21	Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow
1SA.30.22	Then all the corrupt and useless men among the men who went with David reacted and said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them anything from the plunder which we recovered, except
1SA.30.23	But David said to them, “You should not do so, my brothers, with what Yahweh has given to us! He has preserved us and has given the raiding band that came against us into our hand. 
1SA.30.24	And who would listen to you regarding this matter? For as the share of the one who went down into the battle, so the share of the one who remained with the baggage will be. They will share alike.” 
1SA.30.25	So
1SA.30.26	Then David came to Ziklag, and he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, “Here is
1SA.30.27	It was for those in Bethel, for those in Ramoth of the Negev, for those in Jattir, 
1SA.30.28	for those in Aroer, for those in Siphmoth, for those in Eshtemoa, 
1SA.30.29	for those in Racal, for those in the towns of the Jerahmeelites, for those in the towns of the Kenites, 
1SA.30.30	for those in Hormah, for those in Bor Ashan, for those in Athach, 
1SA.30.31	for those in Hebron, and for all the places where David and his men had roamed.
1SA.31.1	Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and they fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.2	And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and the Philistines killed Jonathan and Abinadab and Malki-Shua, the sons of Saul. 
1SA.31.3	Saul was in the thick of the battle,
1SA.31.4	Then Saul said to his armor bearer,
1SA.31.5	And when his armor bearer
1SA.31.6	So Saul died, and his three sons, his armor bearer,
1SA.31.7	And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those who were beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the towns and fled. Thus the Philistines came and lived in them. 
1SA.31.8	And then
1SA.31.9	So they cut off his head and stripped off his armor. Then they sent messengers around in the land of the Philistines to proclaim victory in the temples
1SA.31.10	And they put his armor in the temple
1SA.31.11	When the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard about it, what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1SA.31.12	all of the valiant men
1SA.31.13	Then they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk in Jabesh, and they fasted for seven days. 
2SA.1.1	After
2SA.1.2	On the third day, a man came from the camp from being with Saul, with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head. When he came
2SA.1.3	David said to him, “Where did you come from?” He said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.” 
2SA.1.4	Then David said to him, “How did things go?
2SA.1.5	Then David asked the young man who was reporting to him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan died?” 
2SA.1.6	The young man who was reporting to him said, “I merely happened to be on Mount Gilboa. Here Saul was leaning on his spear, and look, the chariots and the horsemen were getting close to him. 
2SA.1.7	When he turned around and saw me, he called to me, and I said, ‘Here I am.’ 
2SA.1.8	Then he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ And I said to him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ 
2SA.1.9	He said to me, ‘Please stand over me and kill me, for convulsions have seized me, even though my life is still in me.’ 
2SA.1.10	So I stood over him and killed him, for I knew that he could not live after his falling; I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet which was on his arm; and here, I have brought them to my lord. 
2SA.1.11	David grabbed at his clothes and tore them, as did all of the men who were with him. 
2SA.1.12	Then they mourned and wept and fasted over Saul and Jonathan his son until the evening, as well as over the people of Yahweh and over the house of Israel because they had fallen by the sword. 
2SA.1.13	Then David said to the young man who was reporting to him, “Where are you from?” And he said, “I am the son of an alien man. I am an Amalekite.” 
2SA.1.14	David said to him, “How is it that you were not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy Yahweh’s anointed one?” 
2SA.1.15	Then David called to one of the young men and said to him, “Come near; strike him.” So he struck him down and he died. 
2SA.1.16	David said to him, “Your blood is on your head, for your mouth has testified against you by saying, ‘I killed Yahweh’s anointed one!’ ” 
2SA.1.17	Then David sang this funeral song over Saul and over Jonathan his son. 
2SA.1.18	And he ordered “The Bow” to be taught to the children of Judah. Look, it is written on the scroll of Jashar.
2SA.1.19	“The glory of Israel is on your high places; how the mighty have fallen! 
2SA.1.20	Do not tell it in Gath; do not proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon, 
2SA.1.20	lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, 
2SA.1.20	lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult. 
2SA.1.21	O mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew or rain upon you 
2SA.1.21	or on the fields of grain for offerings, 
2SA.1.21	for there the small shield of the mighty was defiled, 
2SA.1.21	the small shield of Saul was not anointed with oil. 
2SA.1.22	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, 
2SA.1.22	the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, 
2SA.1.22	and the sword of Saul did not return without effect.
2SA.1.23	Saul and Jonathan were beloved and pleasant in their lives 
2SA.1.23	and were not separated in their death. 
2SA.1.23	They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions. 
2SA.1.24	O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, 
2SA.1.24	the one who clothed you with crimson, 
2SA.1.24	the one who adorned your clothing with golden ornaments.
2SA.1.25	How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle; 
2SA.1.25	Jonathan lies slain on your high places. 
2SA.1.26	I am distressed
2SA.1.26	you were very dear to me; 
2SA.1.26	your love was more wonderful to me than the love of women. 
2SA.1.27	How the mighty have fallen and the weapons of warfare perished.” 
2SA.2.1	It happened after this that David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah?” And Yahweh said to him, “Go up.” David asked, “Where shall I go up?” And he said, “To Hebron.” 
2SA.2.2	So David went up there along with
2SA.2.3	Also, David brought up his men who were with him, each with
2SA.2.4	Then the men of Judah came, and they anointed David there as king over the house of Judah, and they told David, “The men of Jabesh-Gilead buried Saul.” 
2SA.2.5	So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead and said to them, “May you be blessed by Yahweh because you did this loyal love with your lord, with Saul, and you buried him. 
2SA.2.6	Now may Yahweh show loyal love and faithfulness with you. I will also show the good with you that you have done in this matter. 
2SA.2.7	So then, let your hands be strong and be valiant,
2SA.2.8	But Abner the son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim. 
2SA.2.9	He made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, and over Israel, all of it. 
2SA.2.10	Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel and he reigned two years; however, the house of Judah followed
2SA.2.11	The number of days that David was king over Hebron, over the house of Judah, was seven years and six months. 
2SA.2.12	Abner the son of Ner and the servants of Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	Then Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out, and they met at the pool of Gibeon. The one group sat on one side of the pool, and the other sat on the other side. 
2SA.2.14	Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men come up and fight in our presence.” And Joab said, “Let them come up.” 
2SA.2.15	So they came forward and passed by in number: twelve for Benjamin and for Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David. 
2SA.2.16	Then each seized his opponent
2SA.2.17	Then the battle became increasingly fierce
2SA.2.18	The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was swift with his feet as one of the gazelles which is in the open field. 
2SA.2.19	So Asahel pursued
2SA.2.20	Abner turned around and said, “Are you this Asahel?” And he said, “Yes.” 
2SA.2.21	Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right or to your left; seize for yourself one of the young men, and take his belongings for yourself.” But Asahel was not willing to turn aside from him. 
2SA.2.22	So Abner said to Asahel once again,
2SA.2.23	But he refused to turn away, so Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of the spear, and the spear went out of his back. He fell there and he died on the spot.
2SA.2.24	So Joab and Abishai pursued
2SA.2.25	The descendants
2SA.2.26	Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Will the sword devour forever? Do you not know that there will be bitterness in the end? How long
2SA.2.27	Joab said, “As God lives,
2SA.2.28	Then Joab blew on the trumpet and all the people stopped, and they no longer pursued after Israel, and they did not fight with them again. 
2SA.2.29	Then Abner and his men went through the Arabah all that night, and they crossed over the Jordan. They went all the forenoon and came to Mahanaim. 
2SA.2.30	After Joab returned from pursuing
2SA.2.31	The servants of David had killed some of the Benjaminites among the men of Abner; three hundred and sixty men had died. 
2SA.2.32	Then they picked up Asahel and buried him in the grave of his father, which was at Bethlehem. Joab and his men went all that night arriving in Hebron at first light.
2SA.3.1	The battle was prolonged between the house of Saul and the house of David, but David was growing stronger and stronger
2SA.3.2	And sons were born to David in Hebron; his firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam from Jezreel
2SA.3.3	His second was Kileab by Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; the third was Absalom the son of Maacah, who was the daughter of Talmai the king of Geshur. 
2SA.3.4	The fourth was Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth was Shephatiah the son of Abital. 
2SA.3.5	The sixth was Ithream by Eglah the wife of David. These were born to David in Hebron. 
2SA.3.6	As the war between the house of Saul and the house of David was continuing, Abner was strengthening himself in the house of Saul. 
2SA.3.7	Saul had had a concubine, and her name was Rizpah the daughter of Aiah. Then Ish-Bosheth
2SA.3.8	Abner became very angry
2SA.3.9	Thus may God punish Abner,
2SA.3.10	specifically, to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah from Dan to Beersheba!” 
2SA.3.11	And Ish-Bosheth was no longer able to answer
2SA.3.12	Abner sent messengers to David where he was,
2SA.3.13	He
2SA.3.14	Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul, saying, “Give me my wife Michal whom I betrothed to myself
2SA.3.15	So Ish-Bosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish.
2SA.3.16	But her husband went with her, weeping all along
2SA.3.17	The word of Abner came to
2SA.3.18	So then, bring it about, because Yahweh had said to David, “Through the hand of David my servant I am about to save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.” 
2SA.3.19	Abner also spoke privately to Benjamin.
2SA.3.20	Then Abner came to David in Hebron and with him were twenty men. David had prepared a feast for Abner and for the men who were with him. 
2SA.3.21	And Abner said to David, “Let me get up and go and gather all of Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant
2SA.3.22	And look, the servants of David and Joab came from the raid, and they brought much plunder with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he
2SA.3.23	When Joab and all the army that was with him came, they told Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he sent him away, and he left in peace.” 
2SA.3.24	Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Abner came here to you? Why have you dismissed him that he actually went away?
2SA.3.25	You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you. He came to learn about your going out and coming in and to know all which you are doing.” 
2SA.3.26	Then Joab went out from David, and he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from Bor Hasirah, but David did not know it. 
2SA.3.27	When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate to speak with him in private. Then he struck him in the stomach there and he died, for he had shed the blood of Asahel his brother.
2SA.3.28	When David heard this afterwards, he said: “I and my kingdom are innocent before Yahweh
2SA.3.29	May the blood come down on the head of Joab and all the house of his father. May the house of Joab never lack
2SA.3.30	So Joab and Abishai, his brother, killed Abner because he had killed Asahel, their brother, at Gibeon in the battle. 
2SA.3.31	David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothing and put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner.” Now King David was following after the bier. 
2SA.3.32	And they buried Abner at Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. 
2SA.3.33	The king sang a lament for Abner and said, “Should Abner have died the death of a fool? 
2SA.3.34	Your hands were not tied and your feet were not in contact with bronze fetters. You have fallen as one who falls before sons of wickedness.” Then all the people wept over him again.
2SA.3.35	Then all the people came to give David food. Still on that day, David swore, “May God punish me
2SA.3.36	All the people noticed, and it was good in their eyes, as everything that the king did was good in the eyes of all the people. 
2SA.3.37	Then all the people and all of Israel realized on that day that the king had not desired
2SA.3.38	Then the king said to his servants, “Did you not realize that a prince and a great man has fallen today in Israel? 
2SA.3.39	I am weak today even though anointed king, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are crueler than I am. May Yahweh pay them back for doing wickedness according to their own wickedness.” 
2SA.4.1	When the son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his courage failed
2SA.4.2	Two of the men, commanders of the raiding bands, were for the son of Saul. The name of one was Baanah, and the name of the other was Recab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the descendants
2SA.4.3	The Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and they are resident aliens there until this day. 
2SA.4.4	(Now Jonathan the son of Saul had a son who was crippled in the feet. He was five years old when the message of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse had picked him up and fled. It happened that as she was hurrying away to flee, he fell and became crippled. His name was Mephibosheth.) 
2SA.4.5	When the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Recab and Baanah, set out, they came at the heat of the day to the house of Ish-Bosheth while he was taking a noontime rest.
2SA.4.6	They came as far as the middle of the house as if takers of wheat, and they struck him in the stomach. Then Recab and Baanah his brother escaped. 
2SA.4.7	When they had come into the house, he was lying on his couch in his bedchamber,
2SA.4.8	They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron, and they said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth, the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life. Yahweh has given to my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and on his offspring.” 
2SA.4.9	Then David answered Recab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and he said to them, “As Yahweh lives,
2SA.4.10	when the one who told me, “Look, Saul is dead,” thought that he was bringing good news,
2SA.4.11	How much more
2SA.4.12	Then David commanded the young men, and they killed them, and they cut off their hands and their feet, and they hung them at the pool at Hebron, but the head of Ish-Bosheth they took and buried in the grave of Abner at Hebron. 
2SA.5.1	So all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and they said, “Here we are, we are your flesh and blood.
2SA.5.2	For some time,
2SA.5.3	All the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant
2SA.5.4	David was thirty years old when he began to reign; he reigned forty years. 
2SA.5.5	He reigned over Judah at Hebron for seven years and six months; and he reigned over all Israel and Judah at Jerusalem for thirty-three years. 
2SA.5.6	The king and his men went to Jerusalem, to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land. They said to David, “You will not come here, for even the blind and the lame can turn you back, saying, ‘David cannot come here.’ ” 
2SA.5.7	David captured the fortress of Zion, the city of David. 
2SA.5.8	David had said, “On that day when we attack the Jebusites,
2SA.5.9	David occupied the fortress and called it the city of David. And David built all around it from the Millo and inward.
2SA.5.10	David continued growing stronger and stronger,
2SA.5.11	So Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, along with cedar trees and craftsmen skilled in wood and in stone masonry,
2SA.5.12	David realized that Yahweh had established him as king over Israel and that he had exalted his kingdom because of his people Israel. 
2SA.5.13	David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to him. 
2SA.5.14	These are the names of the ones born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon; 
2SA.5.15	Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia; 
2SA.5.16	Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet. 
2SA.5.17	When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David as king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David, but David heard and went down to the stronghold.
2SA.5.18	Now the Philistines had come, and they spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.19	And David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up to the Philistines? Will you give them into my hands?” Yahweh said to David, “Go up, for I will certainly give
2SA.5.20	So David came to Baal Perazim and defeated them there; and David said, “Yahweh has burst through my enemies before me like the bursting of water.” Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
2SA.5.21	They had left their idols there, so David and his men carried them away. 
2SA.5.22	Once again
2SA.5.23	So David inquired of Yahweh, but he said, “You shall not go up. Rather, go around to their rear and come to them from opposite the balsam trees. 
2SA.5.24	And it shall be
2SA.5.25	So David did thus, just as Yahweh had commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines from Geba all the way
2SA.6.1	David again gathered all the chosen men in Israel, thirty thousand. 
2SA.6.2	David got up and went and all the people who were with him, from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God which is called the name, the name of Yahweh of hosts, upon which the cherubim sit.
2SA.6.3	They loaded the ark of God on a new utility cart, and they carried it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Now Uzza and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were driving the new utility cart along. 
2SA.6.4	So they brought it out from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill with the ark of God, and Ahio was going before the ark. 
2SA.6.5	Now David and all the house of Israel were dancing before Yahweh, with all kinds of musical instruments made from ash trees, and with zithers, harps, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals. 
2SA.6.6	When they came to the threshing floor of Nakon, Uzza reached out to the ark of God and took hold of it, because the oxen had stumbled. 
2SA.6.7	Then the anger of Yahweh was kindled
2SA.6.8	David was angry
2SA.6.9	But David feared Yahweh on that day and said, “How can the ark of Yahweh come to me?” 
2SA.6.10	However, David was not willing to bring the ark of Yahweh to himself, to the city of David, so David caused it to turn to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. 
2SA.6.11	So the ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months, and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom and all his household. 
2SA.6.12	It was told to King David, “Yahweh has blessed the household of Obed-Edom and all that is his because of the ark of God.” So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the city of David with jubilation. 
2SA.6.13	It happened that when the carriers of the ark of Yahweh had marched six steps that he sacrificed an ox and a fatling. 
2SA.6.14	Now David was dancing with all his might before Yahweh, and David was wearing
2SA.6.15	So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of Yahweh with shouts of joyful acclaim and with the sound of the trumpet. 
2SA.6.16	It happened that when the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked down through the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before Yahweh, and she despised him in her heart. 
2SA.6.17	They brought the ark of Yahweh and set it in its place in the middle of the tent which David had pitched for it. Then David offered up burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in the presence of Yahweh. 
2SA.6.18	When David had finished from the sacrificing of the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of hosts. 
2SA.6.19	Then he distributed to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, from man to woman, to each: one ring-shaped piece of bread, one cake of dates, and one cake of raisins; and all the people went each to his house. 
2SA.6.20	When David returned to bless his household, Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David. She said, “How the king of Israel honored himself today by uncovering himself
2SA.6.21	So David said to Michal, “In the presence of Yahweh who chose me over
2SA.6.22	I will demean myself again more than this, and I will be abased in my eyes, but with the maids whom you mentioned, with them I will be honored.” 
2SA.6.23	So for Michal the daughter of Saul, she had no child until the day of her death. 
2SA.7.1	It happened that the king settled in his house. (Now Yahweh had given rest to him from all his enemies all around.) 
2SA.7.2	And the king said to Nathan the prophet, “Look, please, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God is staying in the middle of the tent.” 
2SA.7.3	Nathan said to the king, “Go and do all that is in your heart, for Yahweh is with you.” 
2SA.7.4	But it happened that night,
2SA.7.5	“Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “Are you the one to build for me a house for my dwelling? 
2SA.7.6	For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought up the Israelites
2SA.7.7	In all of my going about among all the Israelites,
2SA.7.8	So then, thus you shall say to my servant David, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, “I took you from the pasture from following
2SA.7.9	and I have been with you everywhere you went.
2SA.7.10	I will make a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them
2SA.7.11	In the manner that
2SA.7.12	When your days are full and you lie down with your ancestors,
2SA.7.13	He will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 
2SA.7.14	I will be a father to him, and he will be a son for me, whom I will punish when he does wrong, with a rod of men and with blows of the human beings.
2SA.7.15	But my loyal love shall not depart from him as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from before you. 
2SA.7.16	Your house and your kingdom shall endure forever before you; your throne shall be established forever.” ’ ” 
2SA.7.17	According to all these words and according to all this vision, this Nathan spoke to David. 
2SA.7.18	Then King David went and sat before Yahweh and said, “Who am I, my lord Yahweh, and what is my house that you have brought me up to this place?
2SA.7.19	Still, this was insignificant
2SA.7.20	What more can David say to you?
2SA.7.21	Because of your word and according to your heart, you have done all of this great thing, in order to let your servant know. 
2SA.7.22	Therefore you are great, my lord Yahweh, for there is no one like you, and there is no god except you, in all that we have heard with our ears. 
2SA.7.23	Who is like your people, like Israel? Israel is the one nation on earth whose God led them,
2SA.7.24	You have established your people Israel for yourself as a people forever, and you, O Yahweh, have become their God. 
2SA.7.25	So then, Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do just as you have promised. 
2SA.7.26	Your name shall be great forever, and they will say,
2SA.7.27	For you, O Yahweh of hosts, are God of Israel! You have revealed to the ear of your servant, ‘I will build a house for you’; therefore your servant has found courage
2SA.7.28	Now, my Lord Yahweh, you alone are God, and your words are
2SA.7.29	So then, be content and bless the house of your servant to be forever in your presence, for you, my Lord Yahweh, have spoken, and because of your blessing, may the house of your servant be blessed forever.” 
2SA.8.1	It happened afterwards that David attacked the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Metheg Ammah from the hands of the Philistines. 
2SA.8.2	When he defeated Moab, he measured them with the cord, making them lie on the ground. He measured two cords to kill and the third cord
2SA.8.3	Then David struck down Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to restore his monument
2SA.8.4	David captured from him one thousand and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand foot soldiers.
2SA.8.5	When Aram of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand men of Aram. 
2SA.8.6	David placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, so Aram became servants of David, bringing tribute. Yahweh protected David everywhere he went. 
2SA.8.7	David took the small round gold shields which had belonged
2SA.8.8	From Betah and from Berothai, the towns of Hadadezer, King David took very many bronze items. 
2SA.8.9	When Toi, the king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer, 
2SA.8.10	Toi sent Joram his son to King David to greet him
2SA.8.11	King David dedicated them also to Yahweh along with the silver and the gold that he had dedicated from all of the nations which he had subdued; 
2SA.8.12	from Aram and from Moab and from the Ammonites
2SA.8.13	So David made a name for himself when he returned from defeating Aram in the Valley of Salt, eighteen thousand. 
2SA.8.14	He put garrisons in Edom; all over Edom he put garrisons, and all of Edom became servants of David. Yahweh protected David wherever he went. 
2SA.8.15	David reigned over all of Israel, and he
2SA.8.16	Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was secretary. 
2SA.8.17	Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests and Seraiah was scribe. 
2SA.8.18	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and the sons of David were priests. 
2SA.9.1	Then David said, “Is there still anyone who is left for the house of Saul that I may show loyal love to him for the sake of Jonathan?” 
2SA.9.2	Now Saul’s household had a servant whose name was Ziba, so they summoned him to David, and the king asked him, “Are you Ziba?” He said, “At your service!”
2SA.9.3	Then the king said, “But is there still anyone of Saul’s household that I may show the loyal love of God with him?” And Ziba said to the king, “There is still a son of Jonathan who is lame in the feet.” 
2SA.9.4	The king said to him, “Where is he?” And Ziba said to the king, “He is here
2SA.9.5	So King David sent and brought him from the house of Makir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar. 
2SA.9.6	So Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David. And he fell on his face and did obeisance. David said, “Mephibosheth,” and he said, “I am ready to serve you.”
2SA.9.7	Then David said to him, “Don’t be afraid, for I will certainly show
2SA.9.8	Then he
2SA.9.9	David summoned Ziba the servant of Saul and said to him, “All that was Saul’s and all his household I have given to the son of your master. 
2SA.9.10	You shall till the land for him, you and your sons and your servants; you shall bring in the produce and it shall be food for the son of your master that he may eat. But Mephibosheth the son of your master may always eat food at my table.” (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty slaves.) 
2SA.9.11	Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my master the king commands his servant, so your servant will do.” So Mephibosheth was eating at his table as one of the sons of the king. 
2SA.9.12	Now Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Micah, and all of the dwelling of the household of Ziba became servants for Mephibosheth. 
2SA.9.13	And Mephibosheth was living in Jerusalem, because he was continually eating at the table of the king, even though he was lame in both of his feet. 
2SA.10.1	Afterwards the king of the Ammonites died,
2SA.10.2	David said, “I will show loyal love with Hanun, the son of Nahash, as his father showed loyal love with me.” So David sent to console him concerning his father, by the hand of his servants. And the servants of David came to the land of the Ammonites.
2SA.10.3	But the commanders of the Ammonites
2SA.10.4	Then Hanun took the servants of David, and he shaved off half of their beards and cut their garments off in the middle up to their buttocks, then sent them away. 
2SA.10.5	When they told David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Remain in Jericho until your beards have grown, and then you can return.” 
2SA.10.6	When the Ammonites
2SA.10.7	When David heard, he sent Joab and all the army of mighty warriors. 
2SA.10.8	The Ammonites
2SA.10.9	When Joab saw that the battle was to be fought on two fronts,
2SA.10.10	The rest of the army he placed into the hand of his brother Abishai, who arranged them in battle lines
2SA.10.11	Then he said, “If Aram is stronger than I am, you must become my deliverer; but if the Ammonites
2SA.10.12	Be strong, and let us strengthen ourselves for the sake of the people and for the sake of the cities of our God. May Yahweh do what is good in his eyes. 
2SA.10.13	Joab and all the people who were with him moved forward into the battle against Aram, and they fled from before him. 
2SA.10.14	When the Ammonites
2SA.10.15	When the Arameans saw that they were defeated before Israel, they gathered themselves together. 
2SA.10.16	Then Hadadezer sent and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates, and they came to Helam. Now Shobach, the commander of the army of Hadadezer, was at their head.
2SA.10.17	David was told, so he gathered all Israel and crossed over the Jordan and came to Helam. Aram arranged themselves in battle lines
2SA.10.18	And Aram fled before Israel, and David killed from the Arameans seven hundred chariot teams and forty thousand horsemen. He struck down Shobach, the commander of his army, and he died there. 
2SA.10.19	When all the kings, the servants of Hadadezer, saw that he had been defeated before Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them, and Aram was afraid to help the Ammonites
2SA.11.1	It came about in the spring,
2SA.11.2	It happened late one afternoon
2SA.11.3	David sent and inquired about the woman, and someone said, “Is this not Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?” 
2SA.11.4	Then David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he slept with her. (Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness.) And she returned to her house. 
2SA.11.5	The woman became pregnant, and she sent and told David, and she said, “I am pregnant.” 
2SA.11.6	So David sent to Joab, “Send Uriah the Hittite to me.” So Joab sent Uriah to David. 
2SA.11.7	Uriah came to him, and David asked how Joab and the army fared and how the war was going.
2SA.11.8	David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet.” So Uriah went out from the king’s house, and a gift from the king went out after him. 
2SA.11.9	But Uriah slept at the entrance of the king’s house with all the servants of his master and did not go down to his house. 
2SA.11.10	They told David, “Uriah did not go down to his house.” David said to Uriah, “Are you not coming from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?” 
2SA.11.11	Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are living in the booths; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping on the surface of the open field; and I, shall I go to my house to eat and to drink and to sleep with my wife? By your life and the life of your soul, I surely will not do this thing.” 
2SA.11.12	David said to Uriah, “Remain here today,
2SA.11.13	David invited him, and he ate and drank in his presence so that he became drunk,
2SA.11.14	And it happened in the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab, and he sent it by the hand of Uriah. 
2SA.11.15	He had written in the letter, “Put Uriah in the front, in the face of the fiercest fighting, then draw back from behind him so that he may be struck down and die.” 
2SA.11.16	When Joab was besieging
2SA.11.17	The men of the city came out and fought with Joab. Some from the army from the servants of David fell; Uriah the Hittite also died. 
2SA.11.18	Joab sent and told David all of the news of the battle. 
2SA.11.19	He instructed the messenger, saying, “As you are finishing to speak all the news of the battle to the king, 
2SA.11.20	if the anger of the king rises and he says to you, ‘Why did you go near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from atop the wall? 
2SA.11.21	Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerub-bosheth,
2SA.11.22	Then the messenger left, and he came and told David all that Joab had sent him to say. 
2SA.11.23	The messenger said to David, “Because the men overpowered us,
2SA.11.24	The archers shot at your servant from atop the wall, and some of the servants of the king died; your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.” 
2SA.11.25	Then David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall say to Joab, ‘Do not feel badly about this matter;
2SA.11.26	When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned over her husband. 
2SA.11.27	When the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his household, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing which David had done was evil in the eyes of Yahweh. 
2SA.12.1	So Yahweh sent Nathan to David, and he came to him and said, “Two men were in a certain city; one was rich and the other was poor. 
2SA.12.2	The rich man had very many flocks and herds, 
2SA.12.3	but the poor man had nothing except for one small ewe lamb which he had bought. He had nurtured her, and she grew up with him and with his children together. She used to eat from his morsel and drink from his cup, and she used to lie in his lap and became like a daughter for him. 
2SA.12.4	And a visitor came to the rich man, but he was reluctant
2SA.12.5	Then the anger of David was kindled
2SA.12.6	He shall restore the ewe lamb fourfold because he has done this thing, and because he had no pity.” 
2SA.12.7	Then Nathan said to him, “You are the man! Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: ‘I anointed you as king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. 
2SA.12.8	I gave you the household of your master and the women of your master into your lap. I also gave you the house of Israel and Judah; if that had been too little, I would have added to you much more.
2SA.12.9	Why have you despised the word of Yahweh by doing evil in his eyes?
2SA.12.10	So then, a sword will not turn away from your house forever, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife!’ 
2SA.12.11	Thus says Yahweh, ‘Look, I am going to raise up evil against you from within your house, and I will take your women before your eyes, and I will give them to your neighbor, and he shall sleep with your wives in broad daylight.
2SA.12.12	Though you did this in secret, I will do this thing before all of Israel in broad daylight!’ ”
2SA.12.13	Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against Yahweh!”
2SA.12.14	But because you have utterly scorned
2SA.12.15	Then Nathan went to his house, and Yahweh struck the child that the wife of Uriah bore for David, and he became ill. 
2SA.12.16	David pleaded with God on behalf of the boy and David fasted. He went to spend the night and lay upon the ground. 
2SA.12.17	The elders of his household stood over him to lift him up from the ground, but he was not willing, and he did not eat any food with them. 
2SA.12.18	It happened on the seventh day that the child died, and the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Look, when the child was alive, we spoke to him, but he would not listen to our voice. How can we tell him, ‘The child is dead’? He may do something evil.” 
2SA.12.19	When David saw that his servants were whispering together, he realized that the child was dead. Then David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” And they said, “He is dead.” 
2SA.12.20	David stood up from the ground and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothing. Then he went to the house of Yahweh and worshiped, and he went to his own house. He asked, so they served him food, and he ate. 
2SA.12.21	Then his servants said to him, “What is this thing that you have done? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept; now that the child has died, you get up and eat food!” 
2SA.12.22	He said, “When the child was still alive, I fasted and I wept because I thought, ‘Who knows? Yahweh may have mercy on me that the child will live.’ 
2SA.12.23	But now he is dead. Why should I be fasting? Am I able to return him again? I am going to him, but he cannot return to me.” 
2SA.12.24	David consoled Bathsheba his wife, and he went to her and slept with her. She bore a son, and he called
2SA.12.25	He sent word by the hand of Nathan the prophet, so he called him Jedidiah
2SA.12.26	And Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites,
2SA.12.27	Then Joab sent messengers to David and said, “We have fought against Rabbah, and we captured the city of the waters. 
2SA.12.28	So then, gather the remainder of the army and encamp against the city and capture it, lest I capture the city and my name be proclaimed over it.” 
2SA.12.29	So David gathered all of the army, and he went to Rabbah and fought against it and captured it. 
2SA.12.30	He took the crown of their king from his head. (Now its weight was a talent of gold, and there was a precious stone in it and it was put on David’s head.) He brought out the plunder of the city in great abundance.
2SA.12.31	He also brought out the people who were in it and put them to the saws and to the iron picks and to the iron axes, and he sent them to the place of the brickmakers. Thus he used to do to all the cities of the Ammonites,
2SA.13.1	It happened afterwards that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar, and Amnon the son of David fell in love with her. 
2SA.13.2	And Amnon was so frustrated that he felt ill
2SA.13.3	Now Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah, the brother of David. (Now Jonadab was a very crafty man.) 
2SA.13.4	And he said to him, “Why are you so sullen every morning,
2SA.13.5	Then Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and appear ill. If your father comes to see you, you shall say to him, ‘Please let Tamar my sister come and give me food to eat, and let her prepare the food before my eyes, in order that I may see it and eat from her hand.’ ” 
2SA.13.6	So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill, and the king came to see him. Amnon said to the king, “Please let Tamar my sister come, and let her bake two cakes before my eyes that I may eat from her hand.” 
2SA.13.7	So David sent to the house for Tamar, saying, “Please go to the house of Amnon your brother and prepare food for him.” 
2SA.13.8	Tamar went to the house of Amnon her brother. Now he was lying down, and she took the dough and kneaded it and made cakes before his eyes, and she baked the cakes. 
2SA.13.9	Then she took the pan and poured it out before him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said, “Let all the men go out from me.” So all the men went out from him. 
2SA.13.10	Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food to the private room that I may eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them to Amnon her brother in
2SA.13.11	When she brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister!” 
2SA.13.12	Then Tamar said to him, “No, my brother! Do not force me, for such a thing has not been done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing! 
2SA.13.13	As for me, where should I take my disgrace? You will be as one of the fools in Israel. So please, speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.” 
2SA.13.14	But he was not willing to listen to her voice. He was stronger than she, and he forced her and lay with her. 
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon hated her very deeply,
2SA.13.16	She said to him, “No, because this evil in sending me away is greater than the other you have done to me.” But he was not willing to listen to her. 
2SA.13.17	Then he called his young man who was serving him and said, “Please send this woman from me to the outside, and bolt the door behind her!” 
2SA.13.18	Now there was a long-sleeved robe on her, for so they clothed the daughters of the king who were virgins, in robes. His servant put her outside, and he bolted the door behind her. 
2SA.13.19	Tamar put ashes on her head, and she tore the long-sleeved robe which was on her. She put her hand on her head, and she went away, crying out as she went.
2SA.13.20	Absalom her brother said to her, “Was Amnon your brother with you? But now, my sister, be quiet; he is your brother. Do not take this matter to heart.”
2SA.13.21	Now King David heard all these things, and he became very angry.
2SA.13.22	Absalom did not speak with Amnon either bad or good,
2SA.13.23	About two full years later,
2SA.13.24	Then Absalom went to the king and said, “Look, here are your servant’s shearers; please let the king and his servants go with your servant. 
2SA.13.25	The king said to Absalom, “No my son, not all of us shall go, so that we not be a burden to you.” And he urged him, but he was not willing to go, but he blessed him. 
2SA.13.26	So Absalom said, “But will you not let Amnon my brother go with us?” And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?” 
2SA.13.27	But Absalom pressed him, so he sent Amnon with him and all of the sons of the king. 
2SA.13.28	Absalom commanded his servants, saying, “Please watch. At the moment the heart of Amnon is tipsy
2SA.13.29	So Absalom’s servants did to Amnon just as Absalom commanded, and all the sons of the king got up, and each mounted his mule and fled. 
2SA.13.30	While they were on the way,
2SA.13.31	Then the king rose and tore his garments, and he lay on the ground, and all his servants standing by were tearing their garments. 
2SA.13.32	Then Jonadab the son of Shimeah, the brother of David, responded and said, “My lord should not think that all the young men, the sons of the king, are dead, because only Amnon is dead. Absalom was talking about it,
2SA.13.33	So then, let not my lord the king set his heart on this matter, thinking, ‘All the sons of the king are dead,’ for only Amnon alone is dead.” 
2SA.13.34	So Absalom fled, and the young man who was keeping watch lifted up his eyes and saw, and there were many people coming from the road behind him from the side of the mountain. 
2SA.13.35	Jonadab said to the king, “Look, the sons of the king have come. According to the word of your servant, so it has come about.” 
2SA.13.36	When he finished speaking, look, the sons of the king came and they lifted up their voice and wept. Also, the king and all his servants wept a very great weeping. 
2SA.13.37	Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, the king of Geshur. David mourned over his son day after day.
2SA.13.38	But Absalom had fled and went to Geshur, and he was there three years. 
2SA.13.39	King David longed to go out to Absalom, for he was consoled that Amnon had died. 
2SA.14.1	Joab the son of Zeruiah realized that the mind of the king was on Absalom. 
2SA.14.2	So Joab sent to Tekoa and took from there a wise woman, and he said to her, “Please pretend to mourn and put on garments of mourning. You should not anoint yourself with oil, and you must act like this woman who has been mourning over the dead for a long time.
2SA.14.3	Then you must go to the king and speak to him according to this word.” Thus Joab put the words in her mouth. 
2SA.14.4	So the Tekoite woman spoke to the king, and she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance. She said, “Help me, O king!” 
2SA.14.5	Then the king asked her, “What do you want?”
2SA.14.6	Your servant had two sons, and they both fought in the open field, and there was no one to part them.
2SA.14.7	And look, all of the family has risen up against your servant, and they said, ‘Give up the one who struck his brother, that we may kill him in exchange for the life of his brother whom he murdered. We will also wipe out the heir,’ and so they would put out my embers which remain, by not preserving for my husband a name and a remnant on the face of the earth.” 
2SA.14.8	Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I myself will give the command concerning you.” 
2SA.14.9	The Tekoite woman said to the king, “On me, my lord the king, is the guilt, and on the house of my father, but the king on
2SA.14.10	The king said, “Whoever has spoken to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you again.” 
2SA.14.11	Then she said, “Please may the king remember Yahweh your God, to prevent the increase of blood avengers who kill,
2SA.14.12	The woman said, “Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.” And he said, “Speak.” 
2SA.14.13	The woman said, “But why have you plotted like this against the people of God? By speaking this word, he is guilty not to bring back his banished one. 
2SA.14.14	For we must certainly die,
2SA.14.15	Now I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, because the people made me afraid, and your servant thought, ‘I will speak to the king, perhaps the king will grant
2SA.14.16	For the king will listen, to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who seeks to destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.’ 
2SA.14.17	Your servant also thought, ‘May the word of my lord the king bring rest,
2SA.14.18	The king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not withhold from me a thing which I am about to ask you.” The woman said, “Please let my lord the king speak.” 
2SA.14.19	The king asked, “Was the hand of Joab with you in all of this?” The woman answered and said, “As your soul lives,
2SA.14.20	In order to change the situation,
2SA.14.21	Then the king said to Joab, “Look, please, I will grant this thing. Go and bring back the young man Absalom.” 
2SA.14.22	Joab fell with his face to the ground and did obeisance. And he blessed the king, and he
2SA.14.23	Then Joab got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 
2SA.14.24	The king said, “Let him go over to his house, and he may not see my face.” So Absalom went over to his house, and did not see the face of the king. 
2SA.14.25	As far as Absalom, there was not a more handsome man in all of Israel to admire so much; from the sole of his foot up to his crown, there was no physical defect on him. 
2SA.14.26	When he shaved his head, it would happen every year,
2SA.14.27	Three sons were born to Absalom and one daughter, whose name was Tamar. She was a woman beautiful of appearance. 
2SA.14.28	Absalom lived in Jerusalem two full years,
2SA.14.29	So Absalom sent for Joab, in order that he send him to the king, but he was not willing to go to him. He sent again a second time, but he was not willing to go. 
2SA.14.30	So he said to his servants, “Look at the tract of land of Joab next to mine,
2SA.14.31	Then Joab got up and went to Absalom, to the house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my tract of land ablaze with fire?” 
2SA.14.32	Absalom said to Joab, “Look, I have sent to you, saying, ‘Come here that I may send you to the king to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there.” ’ So then, let me see the face of the king; if there is guilt in me, then let him kill me.” 
2SA.14.33	So Joab went to the king and he told him. Then he summoned Absalom, and he came to the king, and he bowed down to him with his face to the ground before the king. Then the king kissed Absalom. 
2SA.15.1	It happened afterward that Absalom made himself a chariot with horses and fifty men running before him. 
2SA.15.2	Absalom used to rise early in the morning, and he stood beside
2SA.15.3	Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your case is good and right, but for you there is no hearing with the king.” 
2SA.15.4	Then Absalom would say, “Oh, that someone would
2SA.15.5	It happened whenever anyone drew near to do obeisance to him, that he would stretch his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. 
2SA.15.6	Absalom did like this to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts
2SA.15.7	It happened at the end of four
2SA.15.8	for your servant made a vow while I was staying in Geshur in Aram, saying, ‘If Yahweh will indeed let me return
2SA.15.9	Then the king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he got up and went to Hebron. 
2SA.15.10	Then Absalom sent scouts throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “When you hear the sound of the trumpet, you shall shout ‘Absalom has become king in Hebron!’ ” 
2SA.15.11	Two hundred men from Jerusalem went with Absalom as invited guests, going in their innocence as they did not know anything. 
2SA.15.12	Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, the advisor of David, from his city Giloh, while he offered the sacrifices. The conspiracy grew in strength,
2SA.15.13	Then the messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts
2SA.15.14	Then David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, “Get up and let us flee, for there will be no escape for us from Absalom! Hurry to go, otherwise he will come quickly and overtake us! And he will bring disaster on us and evil! He will attack the city with the edge of the sword!” 
2SA.15.15	Then the servants of the king said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king chooses, your servants are ready to act!”
2SA.15.16	The king went out with
2SA.15.17	So the king went out with
2SA.15.18	All his servants were passing by him:
2SA.15.19	The king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why are you also coming with us? Return and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner; moreover, you are an exile. You are far from your place.
2SA.15.20	Yesterday when you came and today,
2SA.15.21	But Ittai answered the king and said, “As Yahweh lives
2SA.15.22	Then David said to Ittai, “Go and pass over.” So Ittai the Gittite passed over and all his men and all of the little children who were with him. 
2SA.15.23	All of the land was weeping with a loud voice as all the people were passing by and the king was crossing through the Wadi Kidron, and all the people were passing on the road to the wilderness.
2SA.15.24	Suddenly Zadok was there, and all of the Levites with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set the ark of God down, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people passed out of the city. 
2SA.15.25	The king said to Zadok, “Let the ark of God return to the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Yawheh, he will let me return and let me see him in his dwelling place. 
2SA.15.26	But if he says, ‘I take no pleasure in you,’ then I am ready.
2SA.15.27	Then the king said to Zadok the priest, “Are you a seer? Return to the city in peace, with Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons with you. 
2SA.15.28	See, I am waiting at the fords of the wilderness until a word comes from you all to inform me.” 
2SA.15.29	So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and they remained there. 
2SA.15.30	Now David was going up on the Ascent of the Olives, weeping as he went,
2SA.15.31	Now David was told, “Ahithophel was among the conspirators with Absalom.” Then David said, “Please frustrate the counsel of Ahithophel, O Yahweh.” 
2SA.15.32	It happened that as David was coming up to the summit where he used to worship God, suddenly Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him. His coat was torn and dirt was on his head. 
2SA.15.33	David said to him, “If you move on with me, you will be a burden to me, 
2SA.15.34	but if you want to return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I am your servant, O king. I used to be a servant of your father, but from then and now I will be your servant,’ then you can frustrate the counsel of Ahithophel for me. 
2SA.15.35	Will not Zadok and Abiathar the priests be with you there? It shall be that all the words you hear from the house of the king you shall tell Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 
2SA.15.36	Look, there with them are their two sons, Ahimaaz of Zadok and Jonathan of Abiathar. You shall send to me by means of them
2SA.15.37	So Hushai the friend of David came to the city as Absalom was entering Jerusalem. 
2SA.16.1	Now David passed a little from beyond the summit, and suddenly Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him with a pair of saddled donkeys; on them were two hundred loaves of bread and a hundred raisin cakes, with a hundred summer fruits and a skin of wine. 
2SA.16.2	The king said to Ziba, “What do you want to accomplish by bringing these?”
2SA.16.3	Then the king said, “Where is the son of your lord?” And Ziba said to the king, “He is living in Jerusalem for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel shall return the kingdom of my father to me.’ ” 
2SA.16.4	The king said to Ziba, “Look, all that was Mephibosheth’s is yours.” Ziba said, “I hereby do obeisance; may I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king.” 
2SA.16.5	King David came up to Bahurim and suddenly a man from there was coming out from the family of the house of Saul, and his name was Shimei the son of Gera. He was cursing as he came out.
2SA.16.6	And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David and at all the people and at all the mighty warriors on his right and on his left. 
2SA.16.7	Shimei said while cursing him, “Go out, go out, you man of bloodshed,
2SA.16.8	Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the household of Saul whom you have supplanted as king,
2SA.16.9	Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.” 
2SA.16.10	The king said, “What do we have in common,
2SA.16.11	David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Look, my son who came out of my loins
2SA.16.12	Perhaps Yahweh will look in my eye
2SA.16.13	Then David and his men went on the road, with Shimei going on the side of the hill beside him, cursing as he went.
2SA.16.14	When the king and all of the people who were with him arrived, he was weary, so he recovered there. 
2SA.16.15	Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, had come to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him. 
2SA.16.16	When Hushai the Arkite the friend of David came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king, long live the king!” 
2SA.16.17	Absalom said to Hushai, “This is your loyal love with your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?” 
2SA.16.18	Then Hushai said to Absalom, “No, rather, whom Yahweh and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, to him
2SA.16.19	Furthermore,
2SA.16.20	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your advice. What shall we do?” 
2SA.16.21	And Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go to the concubines of your father whom he left behind to watch over the house, then all of Israel will hear that you made yourself odious to your father, and all of your followers will be motivated!”
2SA.16.22	Then they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he went in to the concubines of his father before the eyes of all Israel. 
2SA.16.23	The counsel that Ahithophel gave in those days was regarded as when a man
2SA.17.1	Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Please let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will set out and pursue after David tonight.
2SA.17.2	I will come upon him while he is weary and weak.
2SA.17.3	Then I will return all the people to you; when all have returned, the man whom you are seeking will be dead,
2SA.17.4	The word was right in the eyes of Absalom and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel. 
2SA.17.5	Then Absalom said, “Please call also for Hushai the Arkite, and let us hear what he has to say
2SA.17.6	So Hushai came to Absalom, who said to him, “Shall we do according to this word that Ahithophel has spoken? If not, then you tell us.” 
2SA.17.7	Then Hushai said to Absalom, “The counsel that Ahithophel gave is not good at this time.”
2SA.17.8	Hushai continued, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty warriors and they are enraged
2SA.17.9	Now he has hidden himself in one of the caves or in one of the places. At the moment he falls on them
2SA.17.10	And he is also a valiant warrior,
2SA.17.11	I give the advice that all of Israel from Dan to Beersheba should be completely gathered to you, as the sand which is on the seashore for abundance, with you personally
2SA.17.12	Then we will come to him in one of the places where he may be found, and we shall come upon him as the dew falls on the ground. He and all the men who are with him will not survive, not even one! 
2SA.17.13	Even if he withdraws to a city, all Israel will bring up ropes to that city, and they will drag him away to the valley until there is not even a pebble to be found.” 
2SA.17.14	Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than the advice of Ahithophel.” (Now Yahweh had ordained to frustrate the good counsel of Ahithophel in order for Yahweh to bring misery upon Absalom). 
2SA.17.15	Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “Thus and so
2SA.17.16	So then, send quickly and tell David, ‘Don’t spend the night at the fords of the wilderness! Moreover, by all means cross over lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.’ ” 
2SA.17.17	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel, so a servant girl used to go and tell them, then they would go and tell King David, for they were not able to be seen coming to the city. 
2SA.17.18	But a young man saw them and told Absalom, so both of them went quickly and came to the house of a man at Bahurim. Now he had a well in his courtyard, so they went down there. 
2SA.17.19	Then the woman took and spread a covering over the opening of the well; then she spread out dried grain on it, so nothing was discovered. 
2SA.17.20	When the servants of Absalom came to the woman at the house, they said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” And she said to them, “They crossed over the brook of water.” So they searched but could not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem. 
2SA.17.21	After they left, they came up from the well and went and told King David. They said to David, “Set out and cross over the water quickly, for thus Ahithophel has advised against you.” 
2SA.17.22	So David and all the people who were with him set out, and they crossed over the Jordan until morning light until there was no one
2SA.17.23	When Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled the donkey, and he set out and went up to his house in his city. After he set his house in order,
2SA.17.24	Now David had come to Mahanaim, and Absalom had crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 
2SA.17.25	Absalom had appointed Amasa in place of Joab over the army. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who had married
2SA.17.26	Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead. 
2SA.17.27	Just as David had arrived in Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites
2SA.17.28	brought beds and basins and objects of pottery, as well as wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, 
2SA.17.29	honey, curds, sheep, cheese, and cattle for David and for the people who were with him to eat. For they had thought, “The troops are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.” 
2SA.18.1	Then David mustered the people who were with him, and he appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. 
2SA.18.2	David sent forth a third of the troops under the command of Joab,
2SA.18.3	Then the troops said, “You will not go out, for if we must flee,
2SA.18.4	The king said to them, “I will do what seems good in your eyes.” So the king stood at the side of the gate while all of the troops went out by hundreds and by thousands. 
2SA.18.5	The king ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “With respect to the young man Absalom, deal gently for me.” And all the troops heard when the king ordered all of the commanders concerning the matter of Absalom. 
2SA.18.6	The army went out to the field to meet Israel, and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim. 
2SA.18.7	The army of Israel was defeated there before the servants of David, and the defeat there was great on that day: twenty thousand. 
2SA.18.8	The battle there was spreading over the surface of all the land, and the forest devoured more among the army than
2SA.18.9	Absalom was found in the presence of the servants of David as he was riding on the mule. The mule went under the thicket of the great oak tree, and his head was caught in the tree. He was left hanging between heaven and earth, and the mule which was under him went on. 
2SA.18.10	When a certain man saw it, he told Joab, and he said, “Look, I saw Absalom hanging in the oak tree!” 
2SA.18.11	Then Joab said to the man who was telling him, “Look, if you saw, why did you not strike him down to the ground there? I would have gladly given you
2SA.18.12	The man said to Joab, “Even if I felt the weight
2SA.18.13	If I had dealt treacherously against his life, and there is not any matter hidden from the king, you would have presented yourself aloof.”
2SA.18.14	Joab said, “No longer will I wait in your presence.” Then he took three spears in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak tree. 
2SA.18.15	Then ten of the young men who bore the weapons of Joab surrounded him and struck and killed Absalom. 
2SA.18.16	Then Joab blew on the trumpet and the troops returned from pursuing after Israel, for Joab kept back the troops. 
2SA.18.17	They took Absalom and they threw him into the large pit in the forest and raised a very great heap of stones over him. Then all of Israel fled, each to his tent. 
2SA.18.18	(Now Absalom had taken and set up for himself in his lifetime a stone pillar that is in the valley of the king, because he said, “I have no son in order to remember my name,” and he called the stone pillar by his name. It is called the monument of Absalom until this day). 
2SA.18.19	Now Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Please let me run and bring the good news to the king that Yahweh has vindicated him from the hand of his enemies.” 
2SA.18.20	Joab said to him, “You will not be a man bringing
2SA.18.21	Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen”; then the Cushite bowed down to Joab and ran off. 
2SA.18.22	Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok again said to Joab, “Come what may,
2SA.18.23	“Come what may,
2SA.18.24	Now David was sitting between the two gates, and the sentinel went up to the roof of the gate by the wall and he lifted up his eyes and watched, and look, a man was running by himself. 
2SA.18.25	The sentry called and told the king, and the king said, “If he is alone, good news is in his mouth.” He kept coming closer.
2SA.18.26	Then the sentinel saw another man running, so the sentinel called to the gatekeeper and said, “Look, a man running alone.” The king said, “This one also is bringing good news.” 
2SA.18.27	The sentinel said, “I am seeing that the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zakok.” The king said, “He is a good man; he will come, for good news.” 
2SA.18.28	Then Ahimaaz called and said to the king, “Peace.” He bowed down to the king with his face to the ground, and he said, “May Yahweh your God be blessed, who has delivered the men who raised their hand against my lord the king.” 
2SA.18.29	The king said, “Is it peace for the young man Absalom?” Ahimaaz said, “I saw the great commotion when Joab the servant of the king sent your servant, but I do not know what it was all about.” 
2SA.18.30	Then the king said, “Turn aside, take your place here,” so he turned aside and waited. 
2SA.18.31	Suddenly the Cushite arrived and said, “May my lord the king receive the good news, for Yahweh has vindicated you today from the power of all who stood up against you.” 
2SA.18.32	The king said to the Cushite, “Is it peace for the young man Absalom?” Then the Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you to harm you
2SA.18.33	 The king was upset, and he went up to the upper room of the gate and wept. He said as he went, “My son, Absalom, my son, my son, Absalom. If only
2SA.19.1	And it was told to Joab that the king was weeping and he mourned over Absalom, 
2SA.19.2	so the victory turned to mourning on that day for all the army, because they had heard that day, “The king is grieving over his son.” 
2SA.19.3	The army came secretly
2SA.19.4	and because the king had covered his face and cried with a loud voice, “My son, Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son.” 
2SA.19.5	Then Joab came to the king’s house and said, “Today you have humiliated the faces of all of your servants who have saved your life this day, and the life of your sons and your daughters, the life of your wives, and the life of your concubines, 
2SA.19.6	by loving those who hate you and hating those who love you. Indeed, you have made clear this day that you have no regard for your commanders or officers, for I have realized today that were Absalom alive, and all of us were dead, then that would have been right in your eyes! 
2SA.19.7	So then, get up and go out and speak kindly to your servants,
2SA.19.8	So the king got up and he sat in the gate, and they told all the army, “Look, the king is sitting in the gate.” Then all the army came before the king; whereas all of Israel had fled, each to his tent. 
2SA.19.9	Then it happened that all the people were disputing among all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies, and he saved us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled from the land because of Absalom. 
2SA.19.10	Now Absalom whom we anointed as king over us has died in the battle; so then, why are you taking no action to restore the king?” 
2SA.19.11	Then King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah: ‘Why are you last to bring back the king to his house? The talk of all Israel has come to the king in his house. 
2SA.19.12	My brothers, you are my bones and you are my flesh. Why should you be the last to bring back the king?’ 
2SA.19.13	To Amasa you shall say: ‘Are you not my bones and my flesh? May God punish me
2SA.19.14	So he turned the heart of all the men of Judah as one man, and they sent word to the king, “Return, you and all your servants.” 
2SA.19.15	Then the king returned and he came to the Jordan; Judah had come to Gilgal to come to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan. 
2SA.19.16	Then Shimei the son of Gera, the son of the Benjaminite, who was from Bahurim quickly came down with the men of Judah to meet King David, 
2SA.19.17	and a thousand men were with him from Benjamin. Too, Ziba the servant of the household of Saul and fifteen of his sons and twenty of his servants were with him, and they rushed to the Jordan before the king. 
2SA.19.18	The crossing took place
2SA.19.19	and he said to the king, “May not my lord hold me guilty, and may you not remember how your servant did wrong on the day that my lord the king went out from Jerusalem, by taking it to heart! 
2SA.19.20	For your servant knows that I have sinned; look, I have come this day as the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.” 
2SA.19.21	Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah responded and said, “Because of this, should not Shimei be put to death, for he cursed the anointed one of Yahweh?” 
2SA.19.22	Then David said, “What is it to me or to you, sons of Zeruiah, that you should be an adversary today? Should anyone be put to death in Israel? Do I not know today that I am king over Israel?” 
2SA.19.23	Then the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die,” and so the king swore to him. 
2SA.19.24	Now, Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; he had not taken care of his feet nor trimmed his moustache nor washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he came back in peace. 
2SA.19.25	It happened that when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?” 
2SA.19.26	Then he said, “My lord the king, my servant deceived me, for your servant had said, ‘Let me saddle the donkey that I may ride on her and go with the king,’ for your servant is lame. 
2SA.19.27	But he slandered against your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like the angel of God; do as you see fit..”
2SA.19.28	For there was no one in all the house of my father who were not doomed to death
2SA.19.29	Then the king said to him, “Why should you speak any more about the matter? I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land.” 
2SA.19.30	Then Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him take the whole thing, since my lord the king has come safely
2SA.19.31	Then Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and crossed with the king over the Jordan to escort him through the Jordan. 
2SA.19.32	Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years old.
2SA.19.33	The king said to Barzillai, “You cross over with me, and I will provide for you to dwell with me in Jerusalem.” 
2SA.19.34	Then Barzillai said to the king, “What are the days of the years of my life, that I should go with the king to Jerusalem? 
2SA.19.35	I am eighty years old today. Can I discern between good and bad? Or can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Or can I still hear the voice of singing men and women? Why should your servant be a burden any longer to my lord the king? 
2SA.19.36	Your servant shall go over the Jordan with the king a little way, but why should the king recompense me with this reward? 
2SA.19.37	Please let your servant return, and let me die in my city in the tomb of my father and my mother. Here is your servant Kimham; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him that which is good in your eyes.” 
2SA.19.38	The king said, “Let Kimham go over with me, and I will do for him the good in your eyes, and all that you desire of me I will do for you.” 
2SA.19.39	Then all the people crossed over the Jordan, and the king crossed and kissed Barzillai and blessed him; then he returned to his place. 
2SA.19.40	The king went over to Gilgal, and Kimham went over with him. All the people of Judah went over with the king, and half of the people of Israel too. 
2SA.19.41	Suddenly, all the men of Israel were coming to the king. They said to the king, “Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen away and brought the king and his household over the Jordan, with all the men of David?” 
2SA.19.42	Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is my close relative! Why are you this angry over this matter? Have we by any means eaten anything from the king? Did we take by any means anything that was not ours?”
2SA.19.43	Then the people of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, “I have ten times as much
2SA.20.1	Now a man of wickedness was found there whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite. He blew the horn and said, “There is no share for us in David, and there is no inheritance for us in the son of Jesse; each to his tents, O Israel!” 
2SA.20.2	Then all the men of Israel went up from following after David, following instead after Sheba the son of Bicri, but the men of Judah stuck to their king from the Jordan up to Jerusalem. 
2SA.20.3	David went up to his house in Jerusalem, then the king took the ten concubines whom he had left to look after the house, and he put them under confinement.
2SA.20.4	Then the king said to Amasa, “Summon for me the men of Judah within three days, and be here yourself.”
2SA.20.5	So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he tarried more than the appointed time which he had set for him. 
2SA.20.6	Then David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bicri will do us more harm than Absalom. You take the servants of your lord and pursue after him, lest he find fortified cities for himself and escape from us.” 
2SA.20.7	Then the men of Joab, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty warriors went out after him; they went out from Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba the son of Bicri. 
2SA.20.8	They were near the big rock that is in Gibeon, and Amasa came before them. Joab was dressed in his military clothing,
2SA.20.9	Then Joab said to Amasa, “Is it peace, O you my brother?” Then the right hand of Joab took hold of the beard of Amasa as if to kiss him. 
2SA.20.10	Now Amasa was not on his guard against the sword that was in Joab’s hand, and he struck him with it into the stomach, and his entrails poured out to the ground. He did not strike him again, and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bicri. 
2SA.20.11	A young man stood over him, from the young men of Joab, and he said, “Whoever takes delight in Joab and whoever is for David, follow after Joab.” 
2SA.20.12	Now Amasa was wallowing in the blood in the middle of the highway; when the man saw that all the people stood there, he turned Amasa over from the highway into the field, and he threw a garment over him because he had seen that all who had come by him had stopped. 
2SA.20.13	After he was removed from the highway, all the men passed by after Joab to pursue after Sheba the son of Bicri. 
2SA.20.14	(He
2SA.20.15	And they came and besieged him in Abel Beth Maacah. They threw up a siege ramp against the city, and they stood against the ramparts. And all the army who were with Joab were battering to cause the wall to fall. 
2SA.20.16	Then a wise woman from the city called out, “Listen, listen! Please speak to Joab to come near here so that I may speak to you.” 
2SA.20.17	Then he came near to her, and the woman asked, “Are you Joab?” And he said, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your servant.” He said, “I am listening.” 
2SA.20.18	Then she said, “In former times, they would always say,
2SA.20.19	I am one of the faithful representatives of Israel. You are seeking to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow the inheritance of Yahweh?” 
2SA.20.20	Then Joab answered and said, “Far be it, far be it from me that I should swallow or I should destroy. 
2SA.20.21	That is not the matter. But a man from the mountains of Ephraim, whose name is Sheba the son Bicri, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Give only him to us, and I will depart from the city.” The woman said to Joab, “Look, his head is being thrown down to you over the wall.” 
2SA.20.22	The woman went to all of the people with her wise plan, so they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bicri and threw it to Joab. Then he blew the horn and dispersed from the city, each to his tent. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king. 
2SA.20.23	Now Joab was over all the army of Israel and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Carites and over the Pelethites. 
2SA.20.24	Adoram was over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder. 
2SA.20.25	Shiya was secretary, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests. 
2SA.20.26	Also Ira the Jairite was priest for David. 
2SA.21.1	There was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year. And David inquired of Yahweh,
2SA.21.2	So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites were not from the Israelites;
2SA.21.3	So David asked the Gibeonites, “What can I do for you, and with what can I make amends that you may bless the inheritance of Yahweh?” 
2SA.21.4	Then the Gibeonites said to him, “It is not a matter for us of
2SA.21.5	Then they said to the king, “The man who consumed us and who plotted against us so that we were destroyed from existing in all of the territory of Israel, 
2SA.21.6	let seven men from his sons be given over to us, and we will execute them before Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen one of Yahweh.” Then the king said, “I will give them over.” 
2SA.21.7	But the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the sworn oath of Yahweh which was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul. 
2SA.21.8	So the king took two of the sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, namely Armoni and Mephibosheth, and five of the sons of Michal the daughter of Saul whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite. 
2SA.21.9	He gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they executed them on the mountain in the presence of Yahweh, and the seven fell together. Now they were put to death in the days of the harvest, at the beginning of the harvest of barley. 
2SA.21.10	Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took the sackcloth, and she spread it for herself on the rock at the beginning of the harvest until water gushed forth on them from heaven, but she did not allow the birds of heaven to rest on them by day nor the animals of the field by night. 
2SA.21.11	David was told about what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. 
2SA.21.12	So David left and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the rulers of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth Shan, where the Philistines hung them when
2SA.21.13	He brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there, and they gathered the bones of the executed. 
2SA.21.14	And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin at Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father. They did all that the king had commanded, and afterward God was entreated for the land. 
2SA.21.15	There was war again for the Philistines with Israel, and David and his servants with him went down, and they fought the Philistines, and David grew weary. 
2SA.21.16	Now Yishbi in Nob, who was among the descendents of Raphah
2SA.21.17	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and he attacked the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “You shall not go out with us any longer to the battle, so that you do not quench the lamp of Israel.” 
2SA.21.18	It happened afterward that there was again battle at Gob with the Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph who was among the descendants of the Raphah. 
2SA.21.19	There was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob. And Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim, the Bethlehemite, killed Goliath
2SA.21.20	Once again there was battle at Gath, and there was a man of great size.
2SA.21.21	He taunted Israel but Jonathan the son of Shimei, the brother of David, killed him. 
2SA.21.22	These four were born for the Raphah in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants. 
2SA.22.1	Then David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song,
2SA.22.2	And he said: 
2SA.22.2	“Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer. 
2SA.22.3	I take refuge in God, my rock,
2SA.22.3	My stronghold and my refuge, O my savior, you will save me from violence! 
2SA.22.4	I call upon Yahweh who is praiseworthy, 
2SA.22.4	and I am saved from those who hate me. 
2SA.22.5	For the breaker waves of death engulfed me; 
2SA.22.5	the currents of chaos overwhelmed me. 
2SA.22.6	The ropes of Sheol entangled me; 
2SA.22.6	the snares of death confronted me. 
2SA.22.7	In my distress I called upon Yahweh, and to my God I called. 
2SA.22.7	He heard my voice from his temple, 
2SA.22.7	and my cry for help was to his ears. 
2SA.22.8	The earth heaved and shook, 
2SA.22.8	the foundations of heaven trembled and heaved 
2SA.22.8	because he was angry.
2SA.22.9	Smoke went up from his nostrils and fire from his mouth. 
2SA.22.9	Burning coals devoured, they burned from him. 
2SA.22.10	He bowed the heavens and came down; 
2SA.22.10	a very thick cloud was under his feet. 
2SA.22.11	He rode upon a cherub and flew; 
2SA.22.11	he was seen on the wings of the wind. 
2SA.22.12	He put darkness as a canopy all around him, 
2SA.22.12	a collection of thick rain clouds.
2SA.22.13	From the brightness before him 
2SA.22.13	flamed burning coals of fire. 
2SA.22.14	Yahweh thundered from heaven, 
2SA.22.14	and the Most High uttered his voice.
2SA.22.15	He sent arrows and he scattered them, 
2SA.22.15	lightning, and he directed them. 
2SA.22.16	Then the channels of water of the sea were exposed, 
2SA.22.16	the foundations of the world, 
2SA.22.16	at the rebuke of Yawheh, 
2SA.22.16	from the blast of the breath of his nostrils. 
2SA.22.17	He sent from a high position and took me; 
2SA.22.17	he drew me from mighty waters. 
2SA.22.18	He delivered me from my strong enemies, 
2SA.22.18	from those who hate me, for they were mightier than I. 
2SA.22.19	They approached me on the day of my disaster, 
2SA.22.19	but Yahweh was my support. 
2SA.22.20	He brought me out to a spacious place. 
2SA.22.20	He delivered me because he delighted in me. 
2SA.22.21	Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness, 
2SA.22.21	according to the cleanness of my hands he recompensed me. 
2SA.22.22	For I have kept the ways of Yahweh; 
2SA.22.22	I have not acted wickedly against my God. 
2SA.22.23	For all of his ordinances were before me, 
2SA.22.23	and I did not turn aside from his statutes. 
2SA.22.24	I was blameless before him, 
2SA.22.24	and I kept myself from my iniquity. 
2SA.22.25	Yahweh has recompensed me according to my righteousness, 
2SA.22.25	according to my cleanness before his eyes. 
2SA.22.26	With the loyal, you act as loyal, 
2SA.22.26	and with the blameless, you show yourself blameless. 
2SA.22.27	With the pure, you show yourself pure, 
2SA.22.27	but with the crooked, you appear as a fool. 
2SA.22.28	Humble people you will deliver, 
2SA.22.28	but your eyes are on the haughty, whom you bring down. 
2SA.22.29	For you, O Yahweh are my lamp, 
2SA.22.29	and Yahweh lightens my darkness. 
2SA.22.30	For by you I can run a raid; 
2SA.22.30	by my God I can leap over a wall. 
2SA.22.31	This God, his way is blameless; 
2SA.22.31	the promise of Yahweh is flawless. 
2SA.22.31	He is a shield to all who take refuge in him. 
2SA.22.32	For who is God apart from Yahweh? 
2SA.22.32	And who is a rock apart from our God? 
2SA.22.33	God is my strong refuge, 
2SA.22.33	he has fully opened my way.
2SA.22.34	He makes my feet
2SA.22.34	and on my high places he has set me. 
2SA.22.35	He trains my hands for the war, 
2SA.22.35	so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. 
2SA.22.36	You have given me the shield of your salvation; 
2SA.22.36	your willingness to help has made me great. 
2SA.22.37	You have broadened my steps beneath me; 
2SA.22.37	my ankles have not wobbled. 
2SA.22.38	I pursued those who hate me, and I destroyed them. 
2SA.22.38	I did not turn back until finishing them. 
2SA.22.39	I wiped them out and I smashed them; 
2SA.22.39	they did not get up; they fell under my feet. 
2SA.22.40	You have girded me with physical strength for the battle; 
2SA.22.40	you caused those who rose up against me to kneel under me. 
2SA.22.41	My enemies you cause to retreat from me;
2SA.22.41	I destroy those who hate me. 
2SA.22.42	They looked out, but there was no deliverer, 
2SA.22.42	even to Yahweh, but he did not answer them. 
2SA.22.43	I beat them fine, like the dust of the earth; 
2SA.22.43	like the mire of the streets, I crushed them, I stamped them down. 
2SA.22.44	You delivered me from the strife of my people; 
2SA.22.44	you preserved me as the head of the nations. 
2SA.22.44	A people I had not known served me. 
2SA.22.45	Children of a foreign land came cringing to me; 
2SA.22.45	when they heard of me,
2SA.22.46	Children of a foreign land lost heart 
2SA.22.46	and came trembling from their strongholds. 
2SA.22.47	Yahweh lives! Blessed be my rock! 
2SA.22.47	May God, the rock of my salvation, be exalted! 
2SA.22.48	God does vengeance for me, 
2SA.22.48	bringing down peoples under me. 
2SA.22.49	He brings me out from my enemies, 
2SA.22.49	and from those who rose up against me you lift me up, 
2SA.22.49	and from men of violence you rescue me. 
2SA.22.50	Therefore I will extol you, Yahweh, among the nations! 
2SA.22.50	I will sing praises to your name! 
2SA.22.51	He makes great salvation for his king 
2SA.22.51	and shows loyal love to his anointed one, David 
2SA.22.51	and to his descendants forever.” 
2SA.23.1	These are the last words of David, the declaration of David the son of Jesse, and the declaration of the man exalted by the Most High, the anointed one of the God of Jacob and the darling of the songs of Israel. 
2SA.23.2	“The spirit of Yahweh speaks through me, and his word is upon my tongue. 
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel said to me, the rock of Israel has spoken; ‘He who rules over mankind rules righteously, in the fear of God. 
2SA.23.4	Like the light of the morning when the sun rises, shining with no clouds, bringing vegetation from the earth apart from rain.’
2SA.23.5	Yet not so is my house with God, for he made an everlasting covenant for me, arranging everything. He has secured all my deliverance, and all my desire he will cause to happen. 
2SA.23.6	But evil persons are like thorns cast aside; all of them, because they cannot be picked up in the hand. 
2SA.23.7	And if a man wants to touch them, he must use an iron instrument or the shaft of a spear; then they are consumed entirely with fire on the spot.” 
2SA.23.8	These are the names of the mighty warriors who were David’s: Josheb-Basshebeth a Tahkemonite was chief of three officers; first Adino, whose spear was against eight hundred slain on one occurrence. 
2SA.23.9	Next to him Eleazar, the son of Dodo the son of an Ahohite, was among the three mighty warriors with David when they defied the Philistines and they gathered there for the battle and the men of Israel withdrew. 
2SA.23.10	He stood up and struck down the Philistines until his hand grew tired and his hand clung to the sword, and Yahweh brought about a great victory on that day. Then the army returned back to him only for stripping the dead. 
2SA.23.11	Next to him was Shamma, the son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines assembled at Lehi, a plot of the field was there filled with lentils, and the army fled there from the presence of the Philistines. 
2SA.23.12	But he took a stand in the middle of the plot of land and defended it. He killed the Philistines, and Yahweh brought about a great victory. 
2SA.23.13	Then three
2SA.23.14	Now at that time, David was in the stronghold, and a garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem at that same time. 
2SA.23.15	David said longingly,
2SA.23.16	So three of the mighty warriors broke into the camp of the Philistines, and they drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was at the gate, and they carried it and brought it to David. But he was not willing to drink it, but poured it out to Yahweh. 
2SA.23.17	He said, “Far be it from me before Yahweh that I should do this. Is this not the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?” So he was not willing to drink it. These things the three mighty warriors did. 
2SA.23.18	Now Abishai the brother of Joab the son of Zeruiah was himself the leader of the thirty. He was wielding his spear against three hundred slain and gained a name
2SA.23.19	Among the thirty, is it not that he was honored and became a commander for them? But he did not come up to the three. 
2SA.23.20	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of Ish-Hai, was a great man of deeds from Kabzeel. He struck down two sons of Ariel of Moab, and he went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day. 
2SA.23.21	He also killed a good-looking Egyptian man, in whose hand was a spear. He went down against him with the staff and snatched the spear from the hand of the Egyptian and killed him with his spear. 
2SA.23.22	These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did and gained a name for himself among the three mighty warriors. 
2SA.23.23	He was honored more than the thirty, but he did not come up to the three. David appointed him in charge of his bodyguard. 
2SA.23.24	Among the thirty were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
2SA.23.25	Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, 
2SA.23.26	Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, 
2SA.23.27	Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 
2SA.23.28	Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, 
2SA.23.29	Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin, 
2SA.23.30	Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai from the wadis of Gaash, 
2SA.23.31	Abi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, 
2SA.23.32	Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan 
2SA.23.33	the son of Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite, 
2SA.23.34	Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, 
2SA.23.35	Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, 
2SA.23.36	Igal the son of Nathan from Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 
2SA.23.37	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the carriers of the weapons of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 
2SA.23.38	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
2SA.23.39	Uriah the Hittite; in all, thirty-seven. 
2SA.24.1	Again Yahweh was angry with Israel, and he
2SA.24.2	The king said to Joab, the commander of the army who was with him: “Please go about through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba, and count the people that I may know the number of the people.” 
2SA.24.3	Then Joab said to the king, “May Yahweh your God increase the people a hundred times what they are
2SA.24.4	But the word of the king prevailed over Joab and over the commanders of the army, so Joab and the commanders of the army went out from before the king to count the people of Israel. 
2SA.24.5	They crossed over the Jordan and camped at Aroer to the south of the city, which was in the middle of the wadi of Gad, and up to Jazer. 
2SA.24.6	Then they went to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi. They came to Dan Jaan and around to Sidon 
2SA.24.7	and came to the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went out to the Negev of Judah at Beersheba. 
2SA.24.8	They went about through all the land, and they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
2SA.24.9	Then Joab gave the number of the counting of the people to the king. Israel was eight hundred thousand valiant warriors
2SA.24.10	The heart of David struck him after he had counted the people, and David said to Yahweh, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done! So then, O Yahweh, please forgive the guilt of your servant because I have acted very foolishly.” 
2SA.24.11	When David got up in the morning, the word of Yahweh came to Gad the prophet, the seer of David, saying, 
2SA.24.12	“Go and speak to David, ‘Thus says Yahweh, three things I am laying on you; choose for yourself one of them and I will do it to you.’ ” 
2SA.24.13	Then Gad came to David, and he told him and said to him, “Shall seven years of famine in the land come to you? Or three months of your fleeing from your enemies while he is pursuing you? Or should there be three days of pestilence in your land? Now consider and decide what I must return to the one who sent me a word.” 
2SA.24.14	Then David said to Gad, “I am greatly distressed. Please let us fall into the hand of Yahweh, because he is great in his compassion; but into the hand of man don’t let me fall.” 
2SA.24.15	Then Yahweh sent a plague into Israel from the morning until the agreed time,
2SA.24.16	When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, Yahweh regretted about the evil, and he said to the angel who brought destruction among the people, “Enough, now relax your hand.” Now the angel of Yahweh was at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. 
2SA.24.17	David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel destroying among the people, and he said, “Look, I have sinned and I have done wrong, but these sheep, what did they do? Please let your hand be against me and against the house of my father.” 
2SA.24.18	Then Gad came to David on that same day and said to him, “Go up and erect an altar to Yahweh at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.” 
2SA.24.19	So David went up according to the word of Gad, as Yahweh had commanded. 
2SA.24.20	Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants coming over to him, so Araunah went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. 
2SA.24.21	Then Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” David said, “To buy from you the threshing floor, to build an altar to Yahweh who brought a halt to the plague on the people.” 
2SA.24.22	Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer what is good in his eyes. Look, here are the cattle for the burnt offering and the threshing sledge and the yokes of the oxen for the firewood. 
2SA.24.23	All of this Araunah hereby gives to the king.” Then Araunah said to the king, “May Yahweh your God respond favorably for you.” 
2SA.24.24	Then the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will certainly buy
2SA.24.25	David built an altar to Yahweh there, and he offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then Yahweh responded to his prayer for the land and brought the plague to a halt from upon Israel. 
1KI.1.1	Now King David had become old, advanced in years,
1KI.1.2	His servants said to him, “Let them search for a young virgin for my lord the king, and let her stand before the king. Let her be of use for him, and let her lie in your lap that my lord the king may be warm.” 
1KI.1.3	So they sought a beautiful young woman in all the territory of Israel, and they found Abishag the Shunnamite and brought her to the king. 
1KI.1.4	Now the young woman was very beautiful; she was of use for the king, and she served him, but the king did not have sexual relations with her.
1KI.1.5	Now Adonijah the son of Haggith was exalting himself, saying, “I will be king,” so he prepared for himself a chariot and horsemen and fifty men running before him. 
1KI.1.6	His father did not rebuke him at any time
1KI.1.7	He conferred
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty warriors were David’s; they were not with Adonijah. 
1KI.1.9	And Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened animals near the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel. He invited all of his brothers, the sons of the king, and all the men of Judah, the servants of the king. 
1KI.1.10	But he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the mighty warriors or Solomon his brother. 
1KI.1.11	Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, “Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, but our lord David does not know? 
1KI.1.12	So then, come, let me advise you please, that you may save
1KI.1.13	Come, go to King David and say to him, ‘Have you not, my lord the king, sworn to your servant, “Surely Solomon your son shall become king after me. And he will sit on my throne”? But why is Adonijah king?’ 
1KI.1.14	While you are still there speaking with the king, I will enter after you, and I will confirm your words.”
1KI.1.15	So Bathsheba went to the king in the private room. Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunnamite was attending the king. 
1KI.1.16	Bathsheba knelt and bowed down before the king, and the king asked, “What do you want?”
1KI.1.17	She said to him, “My lord, you swore by Yahweh your God to your servant, ‘Solomon your son surely shall become king after me, and he will sit upon my throne!’ 
1KI.1.18	But now, look! Adonijah has become king! And now, my lord the king, you do not know! 
1KI.1.19	He has sacrificed oxen and sheep and fattened animals in abundance,
1KI.1.20	But as for you, my lord the king, the eyes of all of Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
1KI.1.21	It shall be that when my lord the king sleeps with his ancestors,
1KI.1.22	While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. 
1KI.1.23	They told the king, “Nathan the prophet is here.” He came into the presence of the king and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. 
1KI.1.24	Nathan said, “My lord the king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall be king after me and he shall sit on my throne’? 
1KI.1.25	“For he went down today and sacrificed oxen, sheep, and fattened animals in abundance.
1KI.1.26	But me, your servant, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Solomon your servant he did not invite. 
1KI.1.27	If it was from my lord the king that this thing has happened, then all is well, but if not, you must let your servants know who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.” 
1KI.1.28	Then King David answered and said, “Summon Bathsheba for me.” Then she came before the king and stood in his presence.
1KI.1.29	Then the king swore and said, “As Yahweh lives,
1KI.1.30	surely as I swore to you by Yahweh the God of Israel, saying, ‘Solomon your son shall surely be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,’ surely I shall do so this very day.” 
1KI.1.31	Then Bathsheba knelt with her face to the ground and did obeisance to the king, and she said, “May my lord, King David, live forever.” 
1KI.1.32	Then King David said, “Summon Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,” and they came before the king. 
1KI.1.33	The king said to them, “Take with you all the servants of your lord, and let them make Solomon my son ride on my mule, and bring him down to Gihon. 
1KI.1.34	Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel. Blow on the trumpet and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ 
1KI.1.35	Then you shall go up after him, and let him come and sit on my throne; he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be leader over Israel and Judah.” 
1KI.1.36	Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, “Amen! So may Yahweh, the God of my lord the king, confirm it! 
1KI.1.37	As Yahweh was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.” 
1KI.1.38	Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites went down, and they let Solomon ride on the mule of King David, and they brought him to Gihon. 
1KI.1.39	Then Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent, and he anointed Solomon. They blew on the trumpet, and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!” 
1KI.1.40	All the people went up after him, and the people were playing on the flutes and rejoicing with great joy, and the earth shook with their noise. 
1KI.1.41	And Adonijah and all the invited guests who were with him heard it. Now they were finished eating when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet and said, “Why is there such a noise in the city?”
1KI.1.42	While he was still speaking, suddenly Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. Adonijah said, “Come, for you are a man of valor, and you bring good news.” 
1KI.1.43	Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, “But our lord King David has made Solomon king! 
1KI.1.44	He sent Zadok the priest with the king, and Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites; they made him ride on the king’s mule. 
1KI.1.45	Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him as king at Gihon, and they have gone up from there rejoicing. The city has gone wild; this is the sound which you heard. 
1KI.1.46	And also, Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom! 
1KI.1.47	The servants of the king also came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘Your God has made the name of Solomon better than your name and his throne greater than your throne!’ So the king worshiped on the bed. 
1KI.1.48	What is more, the king said, ‘May Yahweh the God of Israel be blessed, who has given this day one sitting on my throne, and my eyes are seeing it!’ ” 
1KI.1.49	Then all the invited guests who were for Adonijah trembled and got up and went, each on his way. 
1KI.1.50	Adonijah was afraid because of Solomon, and he got up and went and grasped the horns of the altar. 
1KI.1.51	Solomon was told, “Look, Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon, and he has grasped the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me first
1KI.1.52	Solomon said, “If he is a son of noble character, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, but if evil is found in him, then he will die.” 
1KI.1.53	Then King Solomon sent and brought him down from upon the altar. He came and did obeisance to King Solomon. Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.” 
1KI.2.1	The days of David came near for him to die, and he charged Solomon his son, saying, 
1KI.2.2	“I am about to go the way of all the world. Be strong and be courageous.
1KI.2.3	You shall keep the charge of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, his commandments, his judgments, and his testimonies, as are written in the law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all that you do and everywhere you turn, 
1KI.2.4	so that Yahweh may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your sons take heed of their way, to walk before me in faithfulness, with all their heart and with all their soul, no man of yours will be cut off from the throne of Israel.’ ” 
1KI.2.5	“Moreover, you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me when he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner son of Ner and to Amasa son of Jether, and he murdered them and put the blood of war in a time of peace. He put the blood of war on the leather belt that was on his waist and on the sandals which were on his feet. 
1KI.2.6	You must act according to your wisdom, but you must not let his gray hair go down to Sheol in peace. 
1KI.2.7	Regarding the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, you shall do loyal love and let them be among those who eat at your table, because they met me when I fled from Absalom your brother. 
1KI.2.8	And look, Shimei the son of Gera the son of the Benjaminite from Bahurim is with you. Now he cursed me severely
1KI.2.9	So then, do not leave him unpunished, for you are a wise man, and you will know what you must do to him. You must bring his grey hair down to Sheol with blood.” 
1KI.2.10	Then David slept with his ancestors
1KI.2.11	The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 
1KI.2.12	Then Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established. 
1KI.2.13	Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, and she said, “Are you coming in peace?”
1KI.2.14	Then he said, “May I have a word with you?”
1KI.2.15	He said, “You know that the kingship was mine and that all Israel had set their face toward me as king, but the kingship turned around and became my brother’s, for it was from Yahweh for him to have it. 
1KI.2.16	Now one request I am asking from you, and you must not refuse me.”
1KI.2.17	He said, “Please speak to King Solomon, for he will not refuse you, so that he will give to me Abishag the Shunnamite as wife.” 
1KI.2.18	Then Bathsheba said, “Very well, I will speak to the king concerning you.” 
1KI.2.19	Bathsheba came to King Solomon to speak to him concerning Adonijah, and the king got up to meet her, bowed down to her, and then sat on his throne. Then he set up a throne for the king’s mother, and she sat on his right. 
1KI.2.20	She said, “I have one small request I am asking from you. Do not refuse me.”
1KI.2.21	Then she said, “Let Abishag the Shunnamite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.” 
1KI.2.22	King Solomon answered and said to his mother, “Why are you asking Abishag the Shunnamite for Adonijah? Ask for him also the kingdom, for he is my brother, older than I; and ask for him also Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.” 
1KI.2.23	Then King Solomon swore by Yahweh, saying, “Thus may God do to me and thus may he add, if Adonijah hasn’t spoken this thing at the expense of his life. 
1KI.2.24	So then, as Yahweh lives,
1KI.2.25	King Solomon sent through the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, so he struck him, and he died. 
1KI.2.26	To Abiathar the priest, the king said, “Go to Anathoth, to your field, for you deserve to die,
1KI.2.27	So Solomon banished Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh, thus fulfilling the word which Yahweh had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. 
1KI.2.28	When the message came to Joab (now Joab had supported
1KI.2.29	It was told to King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of Yahweh and was beside the altar. So Solomon sent word to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go and fall upon him.” 
1KI.2.30	So Benaiah went to the tent of Yahweh, and he said to him, “Thus says the king: ‘Come out.’ ” And he said, “No, for I want to die here.” So Benaiah returned a word to the king, saying, “Thus Joab spoke, and thus he answered me.” 
1KI.2.31	Then the king said to him, “Do as he spoke; fall upon him and bury him, and so you shall remove the innocent blood that Joab shed from on me and from on the house of my father. 
1KI.2.32	Yahweh will return his blood on his head, because he fell upon two men, more righteous and better than he, and he killed them with the sword, even though my father did not know it; namely Abner son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah. 
1KI.2.33	And their blood will return on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever, but for David and his descendants and for his house and his throne, there will be peace forever from Yahweh.” 
1KI.2.34	So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, and he fell on him and killed him, and he was buried in his house in the wilderness. 
1KI.2.35	Then the king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army, and the king appointed Zadok the priest in place of Abiathar. 
1KI.2.36	Then the king sent and summoned Shimei, and he said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but you must not go out anywhere whatsoever
1KI.2.37	It shall happen that on the day you go out and cross over the Wadi
1KI.2.38	Shimei said to the king, “The word is good that my lord the king has spoken to me; thus will your servant do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days. 
1KI.2.39	It happened that at the end of three years, two of Shimei’s slaves fled to Achish, son of Maacah, the king of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, “Your slaves are here in Gath.” 
1KI.2.40	So Shimei got up and saddled his donkey, and he went to Gath, to Achish, to search for his slaves. So Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath. 
1KI.2.41	When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned, 
1KI.2.42	the king sent and summoned Shimei, and he said to him, “Did I not make you swear by Yahweh? I warned you, saying, ‘On the day you go out and you go anywhere whatsoever,
1KI.2.43	Why have you not kept the oath of Yahweh and the command which I commanded you?” 
1KI.2.44	Then the king said to Shimei, “You know all the evil which your heart knows, what you did to David my father. Now Yahweh will return the evil on your head, 
1KI.2.45	but King Solomon will be blessed and the throne of David will be established before Yahweh forever.” 
1KI.2.46	Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and fell upon him, and he died. So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. 
1KI.3.1	Solomon intermarried with Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and he took the daughter of Pharaoh and brought her to the city of David until he finished building his house, the house of Yahweh, and the walls of Jerusalem all around. 
1KI.3.2	But the people were sacrificing on the high places, for the house for the name of Yahweh had not yet been built in those days. 
1KI.3.3	Solomon loved Yahweh, by walking in the statutes of David his father; only he was sacrificing and offering incense on the high places. 
1KI.3.4	So the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice, for the great high place was there. Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. 
1KI.3.5	Yahweh appeared to Solomon at Gibeon in a dream at night, and God said, “Ask what I should give to you.” 
1KI.3.6	Then Solomon said, “You have shown great loyal love with your servant David my father, as he walked before you in faithfulness and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with you. You have shown for him this great loyal love, and you have given a son to him who is sitting on his throne as it is this day. 
1KI.3.7	So then, O Yahweh, you are my God. You have made your servant king in place of David my father though I am a young boy. I do not know going out or coming in. 
1KI.3.8	Your servant is in the middle of your people whom you have chosen; a great people who cannot be counted or numbered because of abundance. 
1KI.3.9	Give to your servant a listening heart to judge your people, to discern between good and bad, because who is able to judge this, your difficult people?” 
1KI.3.10	The word was good in the eyes of the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing. 
1KI.3.11	And God said to him, “Because you have asked this thing and you did not ask for yourself a long life
1KI.3.12	behold, I do hereby do according to your word. I hereby give you a wise and discerning heart; there was no one like you before you, nor afterwards will one like you arise. 
1KI.3.13	Too, what you have not asked I give to you: both riches and honor, so that no man among the kings will be like you all of your days. 
1KI.3.14	If you will walk in my ways by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David your father walked, then I will lengthen your days.” 
1KI.3.15	Then Solomon awoke, and look, it was a dream, and he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and he offered burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings, and he held a feast for all of his servants. 
1KI.3.16	Then two prostitutes came to the king, and they stood before him. 
1KI.3.17	The one woman said, “Please my lord, I and this woman are living in one house, and I gave birth, with her in the house. 
1KI.3.18	It happened on the third day after my giving birth, this woman also gave birth, and we were together. There was not anyone with us in the house, only the two of us were in the house. 
1KI.3.19	Then the son of this woman died in the night because she laid on him. 
1KI.3.20	So she got up in the middle of the night, and she took my son from beside me while your servant was asleep, and she put him in her lap, and she put her dead son in my lap. 
1KI.3.21	When I got up in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead! When I looked closely at him in the morning, behold, it was not my son whom I had borne.” 
1KI.3.22	Then the other woman said, “No, for my son is the living one, and your son is the dead one.” The other kept on saying, “No, for your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one,” and so they argued in front of the king. 
1KI.3.23	Then the king said, “This one is saying, ‘This is my son, the living one, but your son is the dead one,’ and the other one keeps saying, ‘But no! Your son is the dead one, and my son is living!’ ” 
1KI.3.24	So the king said, “Bring me a sword,” and they brought the sword before the king. 
1KI.3.25	Then the king said, “Divide the living child into two, and give half to the one and half to the other.” 
1KI.3.26	Then the woman whose son was the living one spoke to the king because her compassion was aroused for her son, and she said, “Please, my lord, give her the living child, but certainly do not kill him!” The other one was saying, “As for me, so for you! Divide him!” 
1KI.3.27	Then the king answered and said, “Give the living child to her, and do not kill him; she is his mother.” 
1KI.3.28	When all of Israel heard the judgment that the king had rendered, they stood in awe
1KI.4.1	King Solomon was king over all Israel. 
1KI.4.2	Now these are the officials who were his: Azariah the son of Zadok was the priest. 
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, were the secretaries; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder. 
1KI.4.4	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests. 
1KI.4.5	Azariah the son of Nathan was over the governors, and Zabud the son of Nathan was a priest, an advisor to the king. 
1KI.4.6	Ahishar was over the palace, and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the forced labor. 
1KI.4.7	Solomon had twelve governors over all Israel, and they sustained the king and his palace, each one was to sustain for each month of the year.
1KI.4.8	These are their names: Ben-Hur was in the hill country of Ephraim. 
1KI.4.9	Ben-Deker was in Makaz and in Shaalbim and in Beth-Shemesh and Elon of Beth-Hanan. 
1KI.4.10	Ben-Hesed was in the Arubbot; Socoh and all the land of Hepher were his. 
1KI.4.11	Ben-Abinadab was in all of Naphat of Dor; Taphath the daughter of Solomon was his wife. 
1KI.4.12	Baanah the son of Ahilud was in Taanach and Megiddo and all Beth-Shean which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, of Beth-Shean up to Abel-Meholah up to the other side of Jokmeam. 
1KI.4.13	Ben-Geber was in Ramoth-Gilead; the villages of Jair, the son of Manasseh which are in the Gilead were his, and the region of Argob which is in the Bashan, sixty great cities, with walls having crossbars of bronze, were his. 
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab the son of Iddo was in Mahanaim. 
1KI.4.15	Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he moreover also had taken Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife. 
1KI.4.16	Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and Bealoth. 
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah was in Issachar. 
1KI.4.18	Shimei the son of Ela was in Benjamin. 
1KI.4.19	Geber the son of Uri was in the land of Gilead, the land of Sihon, the king of the Amorites, and of Og, the king of Bashan; one governor which was over the land. 
1KI.4.20	Judah and Israel were as many as the sand which is on the seashore in abundance, eating and drinking and rejoicing! 
1KI.4.21	 Now Solomon was ruling over all the kingdoms from the River
1KI.4.22	The food of Solomon for one day was thirty dry measures of choice meal and sixty dry measures of flour; 
1KI.4.23	ten stall-fed oxen and twenty pasture-fed oxen and a hundred sheep, besides deer and buck gazelles and roebucks and well-fed fowls. 
1KI.4.24	For he was ruling over all the west of the River
1KI.4.25	Judah and Israel lived in security, each man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan as far as Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. 
1KI.4.26	Now Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his war chariots and twelve thousand horsemen. 
1KI.4.27	These governors sustained King Solomon and all who came near to the table of King Solomon, each in his month; they did not omit anything. 
1KI.4.28	The barley and the straw for the horses and for packhorses they brought to the place where they were, each according to his share. 
1KI.4.29	God gave wisdom to Solomon and very great discernment, as well as breadth of understanding,
1KI.4.30	The wisdom of Solomon was greater than the wisdom of all the people
1KI.4.31	He was wiser than all the men: Ethan the Ezrahite; Heman, Calcol, and Darda the children of Mahol; and he was very well known.
1KI.4.32	He spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were one thousand and five. 
1KI.4.33	He spoke concerning the trees, from the cedar which is in Lebanon up to the hyssop which grows on the wall; he also spoke concerning the animals, concerning the birds, concerning the creeping things, and concerning the fish. 
1KI.4.34	They came from all the nations to hear the wisdom of Solomon; from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom. 
1KI.5.1	Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him as king in place of his father, for Hiram had always been a friend for David. 
1KI.5.2	Then Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 
1KI.5.3	“You knew David my father, that he was not able to build a house for the name of Yahweh his God, in view of the warfare
1KI.5.4	But now Yahweh my God has given me rest all around me. There is no adversary, and there is no bad occurrence. 
1KI.5.5	Here I am, intending to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, as Yahweh promised to my father David, saying, ‘Your son, whom I will set in your place on your throne, shall build the house for my name.’ 
1KI.5.6	So then, command that they may cut cedars for me from Lebanon, and let my servants be with your servants. The wage of your servants I will give to you according to all that you say, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.” 
1KI.5.7	When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and he said, “Blessed be Yahweh this day, who has given to David a wise son over this great people.” 
1KI.5.8	Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, “I have heard what you have sent to me; I will do all of your desire concerning the timber of cedars and concerning the timber of cypresses. 
1KI.5.9	My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea, and I will make them into rafts in the sea to float to the place which you indicated to me. Then I shall break them up there, and you may carry them further, and you shall meet my needs
1KI.5.10	So Hiram was giving to Solomon the cedar timbers and the cypress timbers, everything he needed.
1KI.5.11	Then Solomon gave to Hiram twenty thousand dry measures of wheat as food for his household, and twenty dry measures of specially prepared olive oil;
1KI.5.12	Yahweh gave wisdom to Solomon as he promised to him, and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made
1KI.5.13	Then King Solomon conscripted a forced labor from all Israel, and the forced labor numbered thirty thousand men. 
1KI.5.14	He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand every month;
1KI.5.15	Solomon had seventy thousand common laborers
1KI.5.16	Besides the chiefs of the officers Solomon had, there were three thousand three hundred having charge over the people who were doing the work. 
1KI.5.17	When the king commanded, they quarried great stones and precious stones to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stones. 
1KI.5.18	So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites hewed stones, and they prepared the timber and the stone to build the house. 
1KI.6.1	It happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites
1KI.6.2	Now the house that King Solomon built for Yahweh was sixty cubits in its length and twenty cubits in its width and thirty cubits in its height. 
1KI.6.3	The vestibule on the face of the main hall of the temple
1KI.6.4	And he made for the temple
1KI.6.5	and he built a structure against the wall of the temple
1KI.6.6	The lower structure was five cubits in its width and the middle was six cubits in its width and the third was seven cubits in its width, for he made niches for the temple
1KI.6.7	Now while the temple
1KI.6.8	The doorway of the side room in the middle of the side of the temple
1KI.6.9	So he built the house and finished it. He covered the temple
1KI.6.10	He also built the structure against all of the temple
1KI.6.11	Then the word of Yahweh came to Solomon, saying, 
1KI.6.12	“Regarding this temple
1KI.6.13	And I will dwell among
1KI.6.14	So Solomon built the temple
1KI.6.15	He lined the walls of the inside of the house
1KI.6.16	He built twenty cubits from the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor up to the ceiling, and he built for it an inner sanctuary on the inside, as the most holy place.
1KI.6.17	The main hall of the temple
1KI.6.18	with the cedar within the inner house having carvings of gourds and buds of flowers. It was entirely of cedar; there was not a stone visible. 
1KI.6.19	Now in the inner sanctuary in the middle of the temple
1KI.6.20	In front, the inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide and twenty cubits high, and he overlaid it with pure gold and covered the altar with cedar. 
1KI.6.21	Solomon overlaid the temple
1KI.6.22	All of the temple
1KI.6.23	He made two cherubim of olive wood for the inner sanctuary, ten cubits high. 
1KI.6.24	Five cubits was the first wing of the cherub, and five cubits the second wing of the cherub, from the tip of his one wing up to the tip of his other wing. 
1KI.6.25	The second cherub was ten cubits according to the same
1KI.6.26	The height of the first cherub was ten cubits and so was the second cherub. 
1KI.6.27	He placed the cherubim in the middle of the inner house, and they spread out the wings of the cherubim; the wing of the first cherub touched against the wall and the wing of the second cherub was touching against the second wall; their wings spread to the middle of the house and were touching wing to wing. 
1KI.6.28	He also overlaid the cherubim with gold. 
1KI.6.29	On all of the walls around the house, he carved engravings of cherubim and palm tree images and budding flowers both inside and out. 
1KI.6.30	He overlaid the floor of the house with gold both inside and out. 
1KI.6.31	He made doors of olive wood for the doorway of the inner sanctuary, as well as for the doorpost of the fifth doorframe. 
1KI.6.32	On the two doors of olive wood he made carvings of cherubim and palm tree images and budding flowers, and he overlaid them with gold by beating
1KI.6.33	Thus he made doorframes of olive wood on four sides for the doorway of the main hall 
1KI.6.34	and two doors of cypress wood; one door with two folding panels and the second door with two folding panels. 
1KI.6.35	He carved cherubim and palm tree images and budding flowers and overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work. 
1KI.6.36	Then he built the inner courtyard with three rows of dressed stone and a row of cedar beams. 
1KI.6.37	In the fourth year,
1KI.6.38	In the eleventh year in the month of Bul, that is, the eighth month, the house was finished according to all his specifications and according to all his plans. He had built it in seven years. 
1KI.7.1	Solomon built his house over thirteen years, and he finished all of his house. 
1KI.7.2	He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon; one hundred cubits its length, fifty cubits its width, and thirty cubits its height, on four rows of cedar pillars and cedar beams atop the pillars. 
1KI.7.3	It was covered with cedar above, and the supporting beams which were on the forty-five pillars, fifteen to the row. 
1KI.7.4	There were three rows of specially designed windows; with window to window three times. 
1KI.7.5	All of the doorways and the doorframes had four-sided casings, with opening to opposite opening three times. 
1KI.7.6	The hall of pillars he made fifty cubits in its length and thirty cubits in its width, and a porch was in front of them,
1KI.7.7	He made the hall of the throne where he would pronounce judgment, the hall of justice, and it was covered with cedar from the floor to the rafters.
1KI.7.8	His house where he would live in the next courtyard on the inside of the porch was like this work, and he would make a house like this porch for the daughter of Pharaoh whom Solomon had taken as wife. 
1KI.7.9	All of these were of precious stones, according to the measurement of dressed stone, sawn with a saw on all sides;
1KI.7.10	The foundation was of precious stones, and large stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits 
1KI.7.11	with precious stones above, just the right size,
1KI.7.12	The great courtyard all around had three rows of dressed stones and a row of cedar beams; for both the courtyard of the inner house
1KI.7.13	King Solomon invited and received Hiram from Tyre. 
1KI.7.14	He was the son of a widow woman from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, an artisan of bronze. He was filled with wisdom and with ability and with the knowledge to do all the work with the bronze. And he came to King Solomon, and he did all of his work. 
1KI.7.15	He cast the two pillars out of bronze; eighteen cubits was the height of the first, and a cord of twelve cubits would encircle the second pillar. 
1KI.7.16	He made two capitals to place on the tops of the pillars out of molten bronze; the first capital was five cubits in height, and the second capital was five cubits in height. 
1KI.7.17	A network of latticework and wreaths of chainwork with small chains were for the capitals which were on top of the pillars; seven for the first capital and seven for the second capital. 
1KI.7.18	He also made the pillars with two rows around on the lattice, each to cover the capitals which were on top, out of the pomegranate-shaped ornaments, and thus he did for the second capital as well. 
1KI.7.19	And on the capitals which were on top of the pillars in the porch were works of lilies four cubits high. 
1KI.7.20	And capitals were on the two pillars above near the bulging section which was beside the lattice, and two hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments were in rows all around on the second capital. 
1KI.7.21	He set up the pillars for the porch of the main hall; he erected the pillar on the right and called its name Jakin, and he set up the pillar on the left and called its name Boaz. 
1KI.7.22	On the top of the pillars was a work of lilies; and so the work of the pillars was finished. 
1KI.7.23	He also made the molten
1KI.7.24	Gourds were under its rim surrounding it all around; ten to the cubit, surrounding the sea all around with two rows of gourds, which were cast when he cast the metal. 
1KI.7.25	The sea was standing on twelve oxen, with three facing to the north, three facing to the west, three facing to the south, and three facing to the east. The sea was on top of them, with all of their hindquarters turned to the inside. 
1KI.7.26	Its thickness was a handbreadth, but its rim was as the work on the brim of a cup, like the bud of a lily; it held two thousand baths. 
1KI.7.27	He made the ten stands of bronze; each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits in height. 
1KI.7.28	Now this was the construction of the stands: there were frames for them and frames between the crossbars, 
1KI.7.29	and on the frames which were between the crossbars were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the crossbars both above and beneath the lions and oxen were works of cascading wreaths. 
1KI.7.30	There were four bronze wheels for each of the stands, with bronze axles; the four support pedestals for these were under the basin, and the supports were decorated on each side with wreaths. 
1KI.7.31	Its opening from the inside of the capital and above was a cubit; its pedestal was a round work of a cubit and a half; moreover, on its opening were the carvings with four-sided frames, not circular. 
1KI.7.32	Four of the wheels were underneath the frames, and the axles of the wheels were on the stands. The height of each wheel was a cubit and a half. 
1KI.7.33	The construction of the wheel was like the construction of the wheel of the chariot; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their naves were all cast. 
1KI.7.34	The four supports were the four corners of each stand, with the stand supporting it. 
1KI.7.35	On top of the stand was half a cubit deep, circular all around, and on the top of the stand were its supports and its frames. 
1KI.7.36	He engraved on the plates, on its supports, and on its frame cherubim, lions and images of a palm tree, according to the space for each, with wreaths all around. 
1KI.7.37	He made the ten stands like this in one cast, with the same measurement and shape for each of them. 
1KI.7.38	He also made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths; each basin was four cubits, one basin on each of the ten stands. 
1KI.7.39	He placed five of the stands on the south side of the house and five on the north side of the house, and the sea he set on the southeast side of the house. 
1KI.7.40	Hiram also made the basins and the shovels and the bowls for drinking wine; and so Hiram finished doing all of the work that he was to do
1KI.7.41	the two pillars and the bowls of the capitals which were atop the two pillars, and the two lattice works to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were atop the pillars; 
1KI.7.42	and the four hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments for the two lattice works, the two rows of pomegranate-shaped ornaments for each latticework to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the surface of the pillars; 
1KI.7.43	and the ten stands and the ten basins on the stands; 
1KI.7.44	and the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea; 
1KI.7.45	and the pots, the shovels, and the bowls for drinking wine. All the vessels of the tent which Hiram had made for King Solomon for the house of Yahweh were polished bronze. 
1KI.7.46	The king had cast them in the plain of the Jordan with the casting mold set in the ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 
1KI.7.47	Solomon left all of the vessels unweighed because of their very great abundance, so the weight of the bronze could not be determined. 
1KI.7.48	Solomon also made all of the vessels which were in the house of Yahweh: the golden altar and the golden table on which was the bread of the presence; 
1KI.7.49	as well as the five lampstands of beaten gold at the south and five lampstands at the north before the presence of the inner sanctuary, with the flower-shaped ornaments, the lamps, and the pair of tongs all of gold. 
1KI.7.50	The cups, the snuffers, the bowls for drinking wine, the bowls for the incense, and the firepans were made from beaten gold; the facades for the doors of the inner house, for the most holy place,
1KI.7.51	When all of the work which king Solomon did on the house of Yahweh was completed, Solomon brought out the holy objects of his father David, the silver and the gold and the vessels, which he put in the treasury rooms of the house of Yahweh. 
1KI.8.1	At that time, Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, and the leaders of the families
1KI.8.2	All the men of Israel assembled before King Solomon at the festival in the month of Ethnaim, that is, the seventh month. 
1KI.8.3	All the elders of Israel came, and the priests carried the ark. 
1KI.8.4	So they brought up the ark of Yahweh and the tent of assembly
1KI.8.5	King Solomon and all the assembly of Israel who were assembling with him in the presence of the ark were sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted nor numbered because of abundance. 
1KI.8.6	The priests brought the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place in the inner sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place,
1KI.8.7	for the cherubim were spreading their wings over the place of the ark. The cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles from above. 
1KI.8.8	The poles were long, and the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place in front of
1KI.8.9	There was not anything in the ark except
1KI.8.10	When the priests went out from the holy place, the cloud filled the house of Yahweh. 
1KI.8.11	The priests were not able to stand to minister because of the presence of
1KI.8.12	Then Solomon said, “Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the very thick cloud. 
1KI.8.13	I have certainly built a lofty house for you, a place for you to live forever.” 
1KI.8.14	Then the king turned his face around, and he blessed all of the assembly of Israel. (Now all the assembly of Israel was standing). 
1KI.8.15	Then he said, “Blessed be Yahweh the God of Israel who has promised with his mouth to David my father and fulfilled by his oath,
1KI.8.16	‘From the day that I brought out my people Israel from Egypt I have not chosen a city from all the tribes of Israel to build a house where my name might be, but I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’ 
1KI.8.17	David my father desired
1KI.8.18	but Yahweh said to David my father, ‘Because you desired
1KI.8.19	However, you will not build the house, but your son who has come from your loins, he shall build the house for my name.’ 
1KI.8.20	Yahweh has carried out his promise which he had made; I have risen in place of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel as Yahweh promised, and I have built the house for the name of Yahweh the God of Israel. 
1KI.8.21	I have provided a place there for the ark, in which is the covenant which Yahweh made with our ancestors
1KI.8.22	Then Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all of the assembly of Israel, and he spread out his hands to the heavens, 
1KI.8.23	and he said, “O Yahweh, God of Israel, there is no god like you in the heavens above or on the earth beneath, keeping the covenant and the loyal love for your servants who are walking before you with all their heart. 
1KI.8.24	You have kept for your servant David my father what you promised to him, and you have spoken with your mouth, and with your hand you have fulfilled it this very day. 
1KI.8.25	So then, O Yahweh, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you promised to him, saying, ‘For you, no man will be cut off from before me who will be sitting on the throne of Israel, if only your sons keep their ways to walk before me just as you have walked before me.’ 
1KI.8.26	So then, O God of Israel, please let your word be confirmed which you have promised
1KI.8.27	For will God really dwell on the earth? Behold, the heavens and the heaven of heavens could not contain you! How could
1KI.8.28	You must regard the prayer of your servant and his plea! O Yahweh my God, listen to the pleading and to the prayer that your servant is praying before you this day, 
1KI.8.29	so that your eyes will be open to this house night and day, to the place which you said, ‘My name will be there,’ to hear the prayer that your servant prays toward this place. 
1KI.8.30	You must listen to the plea of your servant and your people Israel which they pray toward this place; and you must hear from the place where you live, from heaven you must hear and you must forgive. 
1KI.8.31	If a man sins against his neighbor and he pronounces an oath against him to curse him, and the curse comes before your altar in this house, 
1KI.8.32	then you shall hear in heaven and you shall act and you shall judge your servant, to declare the wicked guilty by bringing his way upon his head and to declare the righteous innocent
1KI.8.33	When your people Israel are defeated before the enemy because
1KI.8.34	then you shall hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and you shall bring them back to the ground which you gave to their ancestors.
1KI.8.35	When you shut up the heavens so there is no rain because they have sinned against you, then they pray to this place and they confess your name and they return from their sin because you punished them, 
1KI.8.36	then you shall hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants and your people Israel, for you will teach them the good way in which they should go, and you will give rain upon your land which you have given to your people as an inheritance. 
1KI.8.37	If there should be in the land famine or disease, if there should be blight or mildew or locust or caterpillars, if it happens that his enemy lays siege against him in the land of his gates, if any plague or any disease, 
1KI.8.38	any prayer or any plea which is offered by any person for all of your people Israel, who each knows the infestation of his own heart and spreads out his palms to this house, 
1KI.8.39	then you shall hear in heaven the place of your dwelling, and you shall forgive and act and give to the man whose heart you know, according to all his ways, for you alone know the heart of all the sons of man. 
1KI.8.40	Do these things so that they may fear you all the days that they live on the face of the land that you gave to our ancestors.
1KI.8.41	Also for the foreigner who is not from your people Israel, and he comes from a distant land because of your name, 
1KI.8.42	(for they shall hear of your great name and your powerful hand and your outstretched arm), and he shall come and pray toward this house, 
1KI.8.43	you shall hear in heaven, the place of your dwelling, and act according to all that the foreigner calls to you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, to fear you as your people Israel, and to know that your name has been invoked over this house that I have built. 
1KI.8.44	If your people go out to battle against his enemy in the way that you shall send them and they pray to Yahweh, toward the city which you have chosen and the house which I have built for your name, 
1KI.8.45	then you shall hear in heaven their prayer and their plea, and you shall vindicate
1KI.8.46	“If they sin against you (for there is not a person who does not sin) and you are angry with them and you give them to an enemy and they take them captive to the land of the enemy far or near, 
1KI.8.47	and then they return their heart in the land where they have been taken captive and they return and plead to you in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned and we did wrong. We acted wickedly,’ 
1KI.8.48	if they return to you with all of their heart and with all of their soul in the land of their enemies who took them captive and they pray to you toward their land which you gave to their ancestors,
1KI.8.49	then you shall hear in heaven, the place of your dwelling, their prayer and their plea, and you shall vindicate them.
1KI.8.50	You shall forgive your people who sinned against you, even for all their transgressions which they committed against you. You shall give them compassion before their captors so that they may have compassion on them, 
1KI.8.51	for they are your people and your inheritance whom you brought from Egypt from the middle of the smelter of iron. 
1KI.8.52	O, that your eyes may be open to the plea of your servant and to the plea of your people Israel, to listen to them in all things when they call to you. 
1KI.8.53	For you have separated them for yourself as an inheritance from all the peoples of the earth, as you promised through the hand of Moses your servant when you brought out our ancestors
1KI.8.54	It happened that when Solomon finished praying to Yahweh all of the prayer and this plea, he got up from before the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling down on his knees with his palms outstretched to heaven. 
1KI.8.55	He stood and blessed all of the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying, 
1KI.8.56	“Blessed be Yahweh who gave a resting place to his people Israel. According to all that he promised, not one word has fallen from all of his promises concerning the good which he spoke through the hand of Moses his servant. 
1KI.8.57	May Yahweh our God be with us as he was with our ancestors,
1KI.8.58	to incline our hearts toward him, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his judgments which he commanded our ancestors.
1KI.8.59	Let these my words which I pleaded before Yahweh be near to Yahweh our God, by day and by night, to maintain the justice of his servant and the justice of his people Israel as each day requires
1KI.8.60	so that all of the people of the earth may know that Yahweh, he is God; there is none other. 
1KI.8.61	Let your heart be completely with Yahweh our God by walking in his statutes, by keeping his commands as this day.” 
1KI.8.62	Then the king and all of Israel with him offered a sacrifice in the presence of Yahweh. 
1KI.8.63	Solomon sacrificed the fellowship offerings which he offered to Yahweh: twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep; and the king and all of the Israelites
1KI.8.64	On that day the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard before the house of Yahweh because he offered there the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the fellowship offerings because the bronze altar that was in the presence of Yahweh was too small to hold the burnt offerings and the grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings. 
1KI.8.65	Solomon held the festival at that time and all of Israel with him, a great assembly from Lebo Hamath up to the wadi
1KI.8.66	On the eighth day, he sent the people away, and they blessed the king, and they went to their tents rejoicing and in good spirits
1KI.9.1	It happened that as Solomon finished the building of the house of Yahweh, the king’s house, and all the things Solomon desired to do, 
1KI.9.2	Yahweh appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him in Gibeon. 
1KI.9.3	Yahweh said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your plea which you have made before me. I have consecrated this house which you have built, by putting my name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there. 
1KI.9.4	As for you, if you walk before me as David your father walked, with integrity of heart
1KI.9.5	then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, ‘A man will not be cut off for you from upon the throne of Israel.’ 
1KI.9.6	“If ever you or any of your descendants
1KI.9.7	then I will cut Israel off from the face of the land that I have given to them, even the house which I have consecrated for my name I will cast away from my face; and Israel shall become a proverb and an object of taunting among all the peoples. 
1KI.9.8	This house shall become a heap of ruins; all those passing by will be appalled by it and hiss, and they will say, ‘On what account did Yahweh do this to this land and to this house?’ 
1KI.9.9	And they will say, ‘Because they have forsaken Yahweh their God who brought their ancestors
1KI.9.10	It happened at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Yahweh and the house of the king, 
1KI.9.11	since Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with wood of cedar and with wood of cypresses and with the gold according to all his desire, then King Solomon gave twenty cities in the land of the Galilee to Hiram. 
1KI.9.12	So Hiram went out from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him, but they were not right in his eyes. 
1KI.9.13	So he said, “What are these cities that you have given to me, my brother?” So they are called the land of Cabul until this day.
1KI.9.14	Then Hiram sent to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold. 
1KI.9.15	This is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon conscripted to build the house of Yahweh and his house, the Millo, the walls of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. 
1KI.9.16	Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, had gone up and captured Gezer and burnt it with fire. He had also killed the Canaanites who were living in the city and had given it as a dowry to his daughter, the wife of Solomon. 
1KI.9.17	Solomon rebuilt Gezer and Lower Beth-Horon, 
1KI.9.18	as well as Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness in the land; 
1KI.9.19	and he also built all of the storage cities which were Solomon’s, the cities for the chariots, the cities for the cavalry, and all of Solomon’s desire that he wanted
1KI.9.20	All of the people who were remaining from the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites who were not of the Israelites,
1KI.9.21	their children who remained after them in the land, whom the Israelites
1KI.9.22	But from the Israelites
1KI.9.23	These were the commanders of the overseers who were over the work for Solomon, five hundred and fifty, ruling over the people doing the work. 
1KI.9.24	As soon as the daughter of Pharaoh went up from the city of David to her house which he
1KI.9.25	Solomon sacrificed three times a year: burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar that he had built to Yahweh, and he offered incense with it before Yahweh; and so he completed the house. 
1KI.9.26	King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion-Geber which is near Elath on the shore of the Red Sea
1KI.9.27	Hiram sent his servants with the fleet of ships, sailors
1KI.9.28	They went to Ophir and imported from there four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and they brought it to King Solomon. 
1KI.10.1	Now the queen of Sheba had heard of the fame of Solomon regarding the name of Yahweh, and she came to test him with hard questions. 
1KI.10.2	So she came to Jerusalem with very great wealth; with camels carrying spices, very much gold, and precious stones. She came to Solomon, and she spoke to him all that was on her heart. 
1KI.10.3	Solomon answered all of her questions;
1KI.10.4	When the queen of Sheba observed all the wisdom of Solomon and the house which he had built, 
1KI.10.5	the food of his table, the seat of his servants, the manner
1KI.10.6	Then she said to the king, “The report which I heard in my land was true concerning your accomplishments and your wisdom. 
1KI.10.7	I had not believed the report to be true until I came and my eyes had seen, and behold! The half had not been told to me. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass
1KI.10.8	Happy are your men and happy are these your servants who stand before you continually hearing your wisdom. 
1KI.10.9	May Yahweh your God be blessed, who has delighted in you to set you on the throne of Israel, because of the love of Yahweh for Israel forever, and he has made you king to execute justice and righteousness.” 
1KI.10.10	Then she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, abundant spices, and precious stones. Spices as these did not come again in such abundance as that which the queen of Sheba brought to King Solomon. 
1KI.10.11	Moreover, the fleet of ships of Hiram which carried the gold from Ophir also brought from Ophir abundant amounts of almug wood and precious stones. 
1KI.10.12	The king made a raised structure for the house of Yahweh and for the house of the king out of the almug wood, as well as lyres and harps for the singers. This much almug wood has not come nor been seen again up to this day. 
1KI.10.13	King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all of her desire that she asked, besides that which King Solomon freely offered her.
1KI.10.14	The weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, 
1KI.10.15	apart from that of the men of the traders and the profits of the traders, and all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the land. 
1KI.10.16	King Solomon made two hundred shields of hammered gold; six hundred measures of gold went up over each shield. 
1KI.10.17	Also he made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; three minas of gold went up over each of the small shields; and the king put them into the House of the Forest of Lebanon. 
1KI.10.18	The king also made a large ivory throne, and he overlaid it with fine gold. 
1KI.10.19	Six steps led up to the throne, and there was a circular top to the throne behind it, and armrests were on each side of the seat,
1KI.10.20	Twelve lions were standing there, six on each of the six steps on either side;
1KI.10.21	All of the drinking vessels of King Solomon were gold, and all the vessels for the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver; it was not considered as something valuable in the days of Solomon. 
1KI.10.22	For the fleet of Tarshish belonged to the king and was on the sea with the fleet of Hiram; once every three years the fleet of Tarshish used to come carrying gold and silver, ivory, apes, and baboons. 
1KI.10.23	King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth with respect to wealth and wisdom. 
1KI.10.24	All of the earth was seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart. 
1KI.10.25	They were each bringing his gift; objects of silver and objects of gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. This used to happen year after year.
1KI.10.26	Solomon gathered chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses. He stationed them in the cities of the chariots and with the king in Jerusalem. 
1KI.10.27	The king made the silver in Jerusalem as the stones, and the cedars he made as the sycamore fig trees which are in the Shephelah in abundance. 
1KI.10.28	The import of the horses which were Solomon’s was from Egypt and from Kue; the traders of the king received horses from Kue at a price. 
1KI.10.29	A chariot went up and went out from Egypt at six hundred silver shekels and a horse at a hundred and fifty. So it was for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Aram; by their hand they were exported. 
1KI.11.1	King Solomon loved many foreign women: the daughter of Pharaoh, Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, Hittite; 
1KI.11.2	from the nations which Yahweh had said to the Israelites,
1KI.11.3	He had seven hundred princesses and three hundred concubines, and his wives turned his heart. 
1KI.11.4	It happened at the time of Solomon’s old age that his wives guided his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully with Yahweh his God as the heart of David his father had been. 
1KI.11.5	Solomon went after Ashtoreth the god of the Sidonians and after Molech the abhorrence of the Ammonites. 
1KI.11.6	So Solomon did evil in the eyes of Yahweh and did not fully follow after Yahweh as David his father. 
1KI.11.7	At that time, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, on the mountain which faces
1KI.11.8	Thus he did for all of his foreign wives, offering incense and sacrificing to their gods. 
1KI.11.9	Yahweh was angry with Solomon, for he had turned his heart from Yahweh, the God of Israel who had appeared to him twice. 
1KI.11.10	And he had commanded him concerning this matter not to go after other gods, but he did not keep that which Yahweh commanded. 
1KI.11.11	So Yahweh said to Solomon, “Because this was with you, and you did not keep my covenant and my ordinances which I have commanded you, I will certainly tear the kingdom from you, and I will give it to your servant. 
1KI.11.12	However, I will not do it in your days, for the sake of David your father; from the hand of your son I will tear it away. 
1KI.11.13	Yet all of the kingdom I will not tear away. I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.” 
1KI.11.14	Then Yahweh raised an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite, from the descendants of that king in Edom. 
1KI.11.15	It had happened that when David was at Edom, Joab the commander of the army went up to bury the slain, and he killed every male in Edom. 
1KI.11.16	For Joab and all Israel had stayed there six months until he exterminated every male in Edom. 
1KI.11.17	But Hadad himself had fled, and some Edomite men from the servants of his father with him, to go to Egypt, when Hadad was a young boy. 
1KI.11.18	They had set out from Midian until they came to Paran where they took men from Paran with them and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt. He gave to him a house and assigned food for him and gave him land. 
1KI.11.19	Hadad found great favor in the eyes of Pharaoh, and he gave him the sister of his wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen, as wife. 
1KI.11.20	The sister of Tahpenes bore Genubath his son for him, and Tahpenes weaned him in the middle of the house of Pharaoh. Genubath was in the house of Pharaoh in the midst of the children
1KI.11.21	Now Hadad heard in Egypt that David had slept with his ancestors
1KI.11.22	Pharaoh said to him, “What do you lack with me that you now are seeking to go to your land?” He said, “No, but you must surely send me away.” 
1KI.11.23	God had also raised Rezon the son of Eliada as an adversary against him, who had fled from Hadadezer the king of Zobah, his master. 
1KI.11.24	He gathered men around him and he became the commander of bandits. When David killed some of them, they went to Damascus and settled there,
1KI.11.25	He was an adversary for Israel all the days of Solomon, and along with the evil that Hadad did, he detested Israel while he reigned over Aram. 
1KI.11.26	Now Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah (now the name of his mother was Zeruah, a widow woman), a servant of Solomon rebelled against the king.
1KI.11.27	This is the reason that he rebelled against the king: when Solomon built the Millo, he closed the gap of the city of David his father. 
1KI.11.28	Now the man Jeroboam was a man of ability, and Solomon saw that the young man was a diligent worker,
1KI.11.29	It happened at that time that Jeroboam went out from Jerusalem, and he accidentally met Ahijah the Shilonite the prophet on the way. Now he had clothed himself with new clothing. While the two of them were alone in the field, 
1KI.11.30	Ahijah took hold of the new cloak which was on him and tore it into twelve pieces. 
1KI.11.31	Then he said to Jeroboam, “Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Behold, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and I will give to you ten tribes, 
1KI.11.32	but one tribe shall be for him, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel; 
1KI.11.33	because he has forsaken me, and they bowed down to Ashtoreth, the god of the Sidonians, to Chemosh, the god of Moab, and to Molech, the god of the Ammonites.
1KI.11.34	But I will not take all of the kingdom from his hand, but I will make him a leader all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my ordinances. 
1KI.11.35	But I will take the kingship from the hand of his son, and I will give ten tribes to you. 
1KI.11.36	To his son I will give one tribe in order to be a lamp for my servant David, always before my face, in Jerusalem the city in which I have chosen to place my name. 
1KI.11.37	You I will take, and you shall reign over all your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel. 
1KI.11.38	It shall be that if you listen to all that I command you and you walk in my ways and you do right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, then I will be with you, and I will build an enduring house for you as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you. 
1KI.11.39	I will punish the offspring of David on account of this; however, not always.’ ”
1KI.11.40	Then Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam got up and fled to Egypt, to Shishak the king of Egypt, and he remained in Egypt until the death of Solomon. 
1KI.11.41	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon and all that he did and his wisdom; are they not written on the scroll of the acts of Solomon? 
1KI.11.42	All the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all of Israel were forty years. 
1KI.11.43	Then Solomon slept with his ancestors,
1KI.12.1	Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all of Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 
1KI.12.2	It happened that Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it while he was still in Egypt where he had fled from the face of King Solomon, and Jeroboam had lived in Egypt. 
1KI.12.3	So they sent and summoned him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came. Then they spoke to Rehoboam, saying, 
1KI.12.4	“Your father made our yoke heavy; now lighten the hard labor of your father and the heavy yoke which he placed on us, and we will serve you.” 
1KI.12.5	He said, “Go up for three days and then return to me”; so the people went away. 
1KI.12.6	Then King Rehoboam consulted with the old men who had been serving
1KI.12.7	They said to him, “If you will be a servant today to this people, then you will serve them; and if you answer them and speak good words to them, they will always be your servants.” 
1KI.12.8	But he rejected the advice of the old men, which they gave him, and he consulted with the youngsters who had grown up with him, who were serving
1KI.12.9	He said to them, “What are you advising that we should reply to this people who spoke to me by saying, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us.’ ” 
1KI.12.10	Then the youngsters who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall say to this people who spoke to you: ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us,’ you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins. 
1KI.12.11	So then, my father loaded a heavy yoke on all of you, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions!’ ” 
1KI.12.12	Jeroboam and all of the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had spoken: “Return to me on the third day.” 
1KI.12.13	Then the king answered all the people harshly, as he had rejected the advice of the old men that they had offered. 
1KI.12.14	He spoke to them according to the advice of the youngsters, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add onto your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.” 
1KI.12.15	So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turning of events from Yahweh in order to fulfill his word which Yahweh had spoken through the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
1KI.12.16	When all of Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What share do we have in David?
1KI.12.17	The Israelites
1KI.12.18	King Rehoboam sent Adoram who was over the forced labor, and all of Israel cast stones at him and he died, but King Rehoboam managed to get up on the chariot to flee to Jerusalem. 
1KI.12.19	So Israel rebelled against the house of David until this day. 
1KI.12.20	It happened that just when all of Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all of Israel. Not one followed after the house of David except the tribe of Judah alone. 
1KI.12.21	When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all of the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand choice troops
1KI.12.22	Then the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 
1KI.12.23	“Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon the king of Judah and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and the remainder of the people, saying, 
1KI.12.24	‘Thus says Yahweh: “You shall not go up and you shall not fight with your brothers the Israelites.
1KI.12.25	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and he resided in it. Then he went out from there and built Penuel. 
1KI.12.26	Then Jeroboam said to himself,
1KI.12.27	if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house
1KI.12.28	And the king had decided, so he made two golden calves and he said to them,
1KI.12.29	He put one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan. 
1KI.12.30	This thing became a sin, and the people walked before the one as far as Dan. 
1KI.12.31	Then he built the houses on the high places, and he appointed priests from all walks of life
1KI.12.32	Jeroboam also inaugurated a religious feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month, like the religious feast which was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar. Thus he did in Bethel, by sacrificing to the calves that he had made; and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made. 
1KI.12.33	He offered sacrifices on the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month which his heart had devised. He inaugurated a religious feast for the Israelites,
1KI.13.1	Suddenly a man of God from Judah came to Bethel, by the word of Yahweh, while Jeroboam was standing at the altar to offer incense. 
1KI.13.2	Then he proclaimed against the altar by the word of Yahweh and said, “O altar, altar, thus says Yahweh: ‘Look, a son will be born to the house of David, Josiah by name, and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones shall burn on you.’ ” 
1KI.13.3	He gave a sign on that day, saying, “This is the sign that Yahweh has predetermined: Look, this altar will be torn apart, and the ashes that are on it will be poured out.” 
1KI.13.4	It happened at the moment the king heard the word of the man of God that he cried out against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him!” But his hand which he stretched out to him was paralyzed, and he was not able to draw it back to himself. 
1KI.13.5	Then the altar was torn apart and the ashes from the altar poured out according to the sign which the man of God had announced by the word of Yahweh. 
1KI.13.6	Then the king responded and said to the man of God, “Please entreat the favor of Yahweh your God, and pray for me that my hand may return to me.” So the man of God entreated the face of Yahweh, and the hand of the king returned to him, as it was in the beginning. 
1KI.13.7	Then the king spoke to the man of God, “Come with me to the house and refresh yourself, that I may give you a gift.” 
1KI.13.8	Then the man of God said to the king, “Even if you give to me half of your house I will not come with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water in this place, 
1KI.13.9	for the word of Yahweh has commanded me, saying, ‘You shall not eat bread nor drink water, and you shall not return on the way that you came.’ ” 
1KI.13.10	So he went another way, and he did not return by the way on which he had come to Bethel. 
1KI.13.11	Now a certain older prophet was living in Bethel, and his son came and recounted to him all of the things that the man of God had done that day in Bethel and the words he had spoken to the king, and they told them to their father. 
1KI.13.12	Then their father asked them, “Which way did he go?”
1KI.13.13	Then he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it 
1KI.13.14	and went after the man of God. He found him sitting under the oak and said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” He said, “I am.” 
1KI.13.15	Then he said to him, “Come with me to the house and eat some food.” 
1KI.13.16	Then he said, “I am not able to return with you or to go with you. I will not eat food nor will I drink water with you in this place. 
1KI.13.17	For a word came to me by the word of Yahweh, ‘You shall not eat food, nor shall you drink water there. You shall not return to go by the way that you came.’ ” 
1KI.13.18	Then he said, “I am also a prophet like you. An angel spoke to me by the word of Yahweh, saying, ‘Let him return with you to your house that he may eat food and drink water.’ ” He lied to him. 
1KI.13.19	So he returned with him and ate food in his house and drank water. 
1KI.13.20	Now it happened that they were sitting at the table, and the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back. 
1KI.13.21	He proclaimed to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Because you have disobeyed the word of Yahweh and have not kept the command which Yahweh your God commanded you, 
1KI.13.22	but you have returned and have eaten food and drank water in the place which he ordered you not to eat food nor to drink water, then your dead body shall not return to the tomb of your ancestors.’ ”
1KI.13.23	It happened after he ate food and drank water that he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back. 
1KI.13.24	When he left, a lion found him on the road and killed him, and his dead body was thrown on the road with the donkey standing beside it, and the lion was standing by the dead body. 
1KI.13.25	As men were passing by and they saw the dead body thrown in the road and the lion standing beside the dead body, they came and told it in the city where the old prophet was living. 
1KI.13.26	When the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard, he said, “It is the man of God who disobeyed the mouth of Yahweh, and Yahweh has given him to the lion. He tore him in pieces and killed him according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken to him.” 
1KI.13.27	Then he spoke to his sons, saying, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled it. 
1KI.13.28	He went and found his dead body thrown in the road and a donkey with the lion standing beside it, but the lion had not eaten the corpse nor attacked the donkey. 
1KI.13.29	So the prophet lifted up the corpse of the man of God and put it on the donkey and brought it back. He came to the city of the old prophet to mourn him and to bury him. 
1KI.13.30	He put his corpse in his tomb, and they mourned over him, “Alas, my brother!” 
1KI.13.31	It happened after he buried him that he said to his sons, “When I die, you shall bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried; you shall lay my bones beside his bones. 
1KI.13.32	For surely, the thing which he proclaimed by the word of Yahweh against the altar which is in Bethel will happen, as it will against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria.” 
1KI.13.33	After this event, Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but he returned and again made priests for the high places of people from all walks of life.
1KI.13.34	This matter became sin in the house of Jeroboam, to make it disappear and to destroy it from the surface of the earth. 
1KI.14.1	At that time, Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill. 
1KI.14.2	Jeroboam said to his wife, “Please get up and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Look, Ahijah the prophet is there, and he spoke concerning me before I became king over this people. 
1KI.14.3	You must take ten loaves of bread in your hand and cakes and a jar of honey, and you must go to him. He shall tell you what will happen to the boy.” 
1KI.14.4	The wife of Jeroboam did so. She got up, went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah was not able to see, for his eyes were fixed
1KI.14.5	Then Yahweh said to Ahijah, “Look, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to seek a word from you about her son, for he is ill. Thus and so
1KI.14.6	It happened at the moment Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps coming through the doorway, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why are you making yourself unrecognizable? I have been sent a hard message for you: 
1KI.14.7	Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: “Because I raised you from the midst of the people and I made you leader over my people Israel, 
1KI.14.8	I tore the kingdom from the house of David and I gave it to you. But you were not like my servant David who kept my commandments, and who went after me with all his heart, to do only what is right in my eyes. 
1KI.14.9	But you did more evil than all who were before you. You have gone and made for yourself other gods and molten idols to provoke me, but me you have completely disregarded.
1KI.14.10	Therefore, look, I am about to bring disaster upon the house of Jeroboam, and I will cut off males
1KI.14.11	He who dies for Jeroboam in the city, the dogs will eat. He who dies in the open field, the birds from the heavens will eat, for Yahweh has spoken it.” ’ 
1KI.14.12	As for you, get up. Go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the child will die. 
1KI.14.13	All of Israel will mourn for him, and they will bury him. This one alone will come to a tomb for Jeroboam, because a good thing has been found in him by Yahweh the God of Israel in the house of Israel. 
1KI.14.14	Yahweh will raise up a king for himself over Israel who will even now cut off the house of Jeroboam this day. 
1KI.14.15	Yahweh will strike Israel as one shakes the reed plant in the water, and he will root Israel up from this good land that he gave to their ancestors.
1KI.14.16	He will give up Israel because of the sin of Jeroboam which he sinned and which he caused Israel to sin.” 
1KI.14.17	Then the wife of Jeroboam got up, went, and came to Tirzah. As she was coming to the threshold of the house, the boy died. 
1KI.14.18	They buried him and all of Israel mourned for him, according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet. 
1KI.14.19	The remainder of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel. 
1KI.14.20	The days which Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years, and he slept with his ancestors.
1KI.14.21	Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which, from all of the tribes of Israel, Yahweh chose to place his name. And the name of his mother was Naamah the Ammonitess. 
1KI.14.22	But Judah did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and they annoyed him more than their fathers
1KI.14.23	They also built for themselves high places and stone pillars and sacred poles on every high hill and under every green tree. 
1KI.14.24	There were also male shrine prostitutes in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh had driven out from before the Israelites.
1KI.14.25	It happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, 
1KI.14.26	and he took the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and he took all the treasures of the king’s house. He took the small gold shields that Solomon had made, 
1KI.14.27	so King Rehoboam made small copper shields in place of them and entrusted them
1KI.14.28	Whenever the king came to the house of Yahweh, the royal guard carried them and brought them back to the alcove room of the royal guard. 
1KI.14.29	The remainder of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 
1KI.14.30	There was always war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. 
1KI.14.31	Then Rehoboam slept with his ancestors,
1KI.15.1	In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah. 
1KI.15.2	Three years he reigned in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. 
1KI.15.3	He walked in all the sins of his father that he had done before him, and his heart was not fully with Yahweh his God as the heart of David his father. 
1KI.15.4	For the sake of David, Yahweh his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, by establishing his son after him and by causing Jerusalem to exist; 
1KI.15.5	because David did right in the eyes of Yahweh and he didn’t turn aside from all that he commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. 
1KI.15.6	There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. 
1KI.15.7	The remainder of the acts of Abijam and all that he did, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? There was also war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 
1KI.15.8	Abijam slept with his ancestors,
1KI.15.9	In the twentieth year of Jeroboam the king of Israel, Asa became the king of Judah. 
1KI.15.10	He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. 
1KI.15.11	Asa did right in the eyes of Yahweh, like David his ancestor.
1KI.15.12	He put away the male shrine prostitutes from the land, and he removed all of the idols that his ancestors
1KI.15.13	Also, he had Maacah his mother removed from the office of queen mother, as she had made a repulsive image for the Asherah. Asa also cut down her repulsive image and burned it in the Wadi
1KI.15.14	But the high places he did not remove. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was completely with Yahweh all of his days. 
1KI.15.15	He brought the holy objects of his father and his own holy objects to the house of Yahweh, silver and gold and utensils. 
1KI.15.16	There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all of their days. 
1KI.15.17	Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and he built Ramah to hinder the coming and going of anyone to Asa
1KI.15.18	Asa took all of the silver and gold remaining in the storerooms of the house of Yahweh and in the treasury rooms of the house of the king, and he gave them into the hand of his servants; so King Asa sent them to Ben-Hadad the son of Tabrimmon the son of Hezion, the king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, saying, 
1KI.15.19	“Let there be a covenant between me and you, between my father and your father. Look, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel that he may go up away from me.” 
1KI.15.20	Ben-Hadad listened to King Asa, and he sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel and he attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel-Beth-Maacah, and all of Kinnereth, in addition to all the land of Naphtali. 
1KI.15.21	When Baasha heard, he stopped building Ramah, and he lived in Tirzah. 
1KI.15.22	Then King Asa proclaimed among all of Israel that there was no one free from obligation, so they carried the stones of Ramah and its wood with which Baasha had built, and King Asa rebuilt Geba in Benjamin with them, and the Mizpah. 
1KI.15.23	The remainder of the acts of Asa, all of his achievements, all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? But at the time of his old age, he developed a foot disease.
1KI.15.24	Asa slept with his ancestors
1KI.15.25	Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. 
1KI.15.26	He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and he walked in the way of his father and in his sin that he caused Israel to commit. 
1KI.15.27	Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against him, and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. Now Nadab and all of Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon, 
1KI.15.28	and Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa the king of Judah, and he reigned in his place. 
1KI.15.29	It happened that as soon as he became king, he killed all of the house of Jeroboam. There was no one left of Jeroboam who breathed, until he had destroyed him according to the word of Yahweh that he had spoken by the hand of his servant, Ahijah the Shilonite, 
1KI.15.30	because of the sins of Jeroboam that he had committed and that he had caused Israel to commit and because of his anger with which he had provoked Yahweh the God of Israel. 
1KI.15.31	Now the remainder of the acts of Nadab and all that he did, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.15.32	There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 
1KI.15.33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah had become king over all of Israel; he lived in Tirzah twenty-four years. 
1KI.15.34	He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and he walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin that he caused Israel to commit. 
1KI.16.1	 The word of Yahweh came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying, 
1KI.16.2	“Because I exalted you from the dust and I made you a leader over my people Israel, but you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and you caused my people Israel to sin, to provoke me with their sins, 
1KI.16.3	I am now about to consume Baasha and his house. I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
1KI.16.4	Those who die for Baasha in the city, the dogs will eat; those who die for him in the field, the birds of the heavens will eat.” 
1KI.16.5	The remainder of the acts of Baasha, what he did, and his powerful deeds, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.6	Baasha slept with his ancestors
1KI.16.7	Moreover, the word of Yahweh came to Baasha and to his house by the hand of Jehu the son of Hanani the prophet, because of all the evil that he did in the eyes of Yahweh by provoking him with the work of his hands, by being like the house of Jeroboam; and he destroyed him. 
1KI.16.8	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel for two years. 
1KI.16.9	His servant Zimri the commander of half of the chariots conspired against him. Now he had been in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza who was over the palace in Tirzah. 
1KI.16.10	Zimri came and struck him down and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah and became king in his place. 
1KI.16.11	It happened that as soon as he became king, at the moment he sat on his throne, he killed all of the house of Baasha. He left no males
1KI.16.12	So Zimri destroyed all of the house of Baasha according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke against Baasha by the hand of Jehu the prophet 
1KI.16.13	because of all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son which they committed and which they caused Israel to sin by provoking Yahweh the God of Israel with their idols. 
1KI.16.14	The remainder of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.15	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the army was encamping against Gibbethon which belonged to the Philistines. 
1KI.16.16	The encamping army heard that Zimri had conspired and moreover had killed the king,
1KI.16.17	Then Omri went up and all Israel with him from Gibbethon, and they besieged Tirzah. 
1KI.16.18	It happened that when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went to the citadel fortress of the house of the king, and he burnt the house of the king over him with fire so that he died. 
1KI.16.19	This happened because of his sin which he committed by doing evil in the eyes of Yahweh, by going the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he did by causing Israel to sin. 
1KI.16.20	The remainder of the acts of Zimri and his conspiracy which he made, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.21	At that time, the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people went after Tibni the son of Ginath to make him king, and the other half went after Omri. 
1KI.16.22	The people who went after Omri overcame the people who went after Tibni the son of Ginath, so that he died and Omri became king. 
1KI.16.23	In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel for twelve years. He reigned in Tirzah six years, 
1KI.16.24	then bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver, fortified the hill, and called the name of the city Samaria that he built after Shemer, the owner of the hill. 
1KI.16.25	But Omri did evil in the eyes of Yahweh more than all who were before him. 
1KI.16.26	He went in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in his sins that he caused Israel to sin by provoking Yahweh the God of Israel with their idols. 
1KI.16.27	The remainder of the acts of Omri that he did and his powerful deeds, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.28	Omri slept with his ancestors,
1KI.16.29	Now Ahab son of Omri became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah. Ahab son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years. 
1KI.16.30	But Ahab son of Omri did evil in the eyes of Yahweh more than all who were before him. 
1KI.16.31	If it wasn’t enough that he went
1KI.16.32	And he built an altar to Baal in the house of Baal which he had built in Samaria. 
1KI.16.33	Ahab also made the sacred pole, and he continued to provoke
1KI.16.34	In his days, Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho; at the cost of Abiram his firstborn he laid its foundation, and at the cost of Segub his younger sibling, he set up its gates, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of Joshua the son of Nun. 
1KI.17.1	Elijah the Tishbite from Tishbe of Gilead said to Ahab, “As Yahweh lives,
1KI.17.2	Then the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, 
1KI.17.3	“Go from this place and turn to the east; you must hide yourself in the Wadi
1KI.17.4	It shall be that you shall drink from the wadi,
1KI.17.5	So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh. He went and stayed in the Wadi
1KI.17.6	The crows were bringing bread and meat in the morning for him and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the wadi.
1KI.17.7	It happened after a while
1KI.17.8	Then the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, 
1KI.17.9	“Get up and go to Zarephath which belongs to Sidon and stay there. Look, I have commanded a woman there, a widow, to sustain you.” 
1KI.17.10	So he arose and went to Zarephath and came to the gate of the city. There was a widow woman gathering wood, so he called to her, and he said, “Please bring a little water for me in a vessel so that I can drink.” 
1KI.17.11	She went to fetch it, and he called to her and said, “Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.” 
1KI.17.12	She said, “As Yahweh your God lives,
1KI.17.13	Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do according to your word; only make for me a small bread cake from it first, and bring it out to me. Make it for yourself and for your son afterward. 
1KI.17.14	For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘The jar of flour will not be emptied and the jug of olive oil will not run out until the day Yahweh gives rain on the surface of the earth.’ ” 
1KI.17.15	So she went and did according to the word of Elijah; then both she and he ate with her household for many days. 
1KI.17.16	The jar of flour was not emptied and the jug of olive oil did not run out, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of Elijah. 
1KI.17.17	It happened after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill; and his illness was very severe until there was no breath left in him. 
1KI.17.18	She said to Elijah, “What do you have against me,
1KI.17.19	Then he said to her, “Give me your son.” He took him from her lap and carried him up to the upper room where he was staying, and he laid him on his bed. 
1KI.17.20	Then he called to Yahweh and said, “O Yahweh my God, are you also causing evil to come upon the widow with whom I am dwelling as an alien by causing her son to die?” 
1KI.17.21	He stretched himself out on the child three times and called to Yahweh and said, “O Yahweh my God, please let the life of this child return within him.” 
1KI.17.22	Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah, and the life of the child returned within him, and he lived. 
1KI.17.23	Elijah then took the child and brought him down from the upper room to the house and gave him to his mother. Elijah said, “Look, your son is alive.” 
1KI.17.24	Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now this I know, that you are a man of God and the word of Yahweh in your mouth is truth.” 
1KI.18.1	It happened many days later that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah in the third year, saying, “Go, present yourself to Ahab so that I may give rain on the surface of the earth.” 
1KI.18.2	So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria. 
1KI.18.3	Ahab summoned Obadiah who was over the house. (Now Obadiah was fearing Yahweh greatly. 
1KI.18.4	It had happened that when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties
1KI.18.5	Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the wadis.
1KI.18.6	So they divided the land for themselves in order to pass through it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. 
1KI.18.7	It happened that Obadiah was on the way, and suddenly Elijah was there to meet him. When he recognized him, he fell on his face and said, “Is this you, my lord Elijah?” 
1KI.18.8	He said to him, “I am. Go, say to your lord, ‘Elijah is here.’ ” 
1KI.18.9	He said, “How have I sinned that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ahab to kill me? 
1KI.18.10	As Yahweh your God lives,
1KI.18.11	Now you are saying, ‘Go, say to your lord: “Elijah is here.” ’ 
1KI.18.12	And it will happen that I will go from you and the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you up to where I do not know. Then I will come to tell Ahab, but he will not find you, and then he will kill me, even though your servant has feared Yahweh from my youth. 
1KI.18.13	Has it not been told to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh? I hid a hundred men of the prophets of Yahweh by fifties
1KI.18.14	Now you are saying, ‘Go, say to your lord: “Elijah is here,” ’ and he will kill me.” 
1KI.18.15	Elijah said, “As Yahweh of hosts lives,
1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and he told him, so Ahab went to meet Elijah. 
1KI.18.17	When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is this you who throws Israel into confusion?” 
1KI.18.18	He said, “I did not throw Israel into confusion; rather you and the house of your father have by forsaking the commands of Yahweh when you went after the Baals! 
1KI.18.19	So then, send word and assemble all of Israel to me on Mount Carmel, with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at the table of Jezebel.” 
1KI.18.20	So Ahab sent word among the Israelites,
1KI.18.21	Elijah approached to all the people and said, “How long will you go limping over two opinions? If Yahweh is God, go after him; but if Baal, go after him.” But the people did not answer him a word. 
1KI.18.22	Then Elijah said to the people, “I alone am left a prophet of Yahweh, but the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men. 
1KI.18.23	Let them give us two bulls, and let them choose for themselves one bull, cut him in pieces, and put it on the wood, but don’t let them start a fire on it. I will prepare the other bull and set it on the wood, but I will put no fire on it. 
1KI.18.24	Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Yahweh, and it shall be that the god who answers by fire, he is God.”
1KI.18.25	Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are the majority, and call on the name of your god, but don’t set fire under it.” 
1KI.18.26	So they took the bull that he allowed to them, prepared it, and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no voice and there was no answer, so they limped
1KI.18.27	It happened at noon that Elijah mocked them and said, “Call out with a loud voice, for he is a god! Perhaps he is meditating, or is using the bathroom,
1KI.18.28	So they called out with a loud voice, and they cut themselves with swords and with spears as was their custom, until the blood poured out over them. 
1KI.18.29	It happened as noon passed, they raged until the time of the evening offering, but there was no voice, there was no answer, and no one paid attention. 
1KI.18.30	Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me,” so all the people came closer to him. He repaired the altar of Yahweh that had been destroyed. 
1KI.18.31	Elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of God came, saying, “Israel shall be your name.” 
1KI.18.32	With them, he built an altar in the name of Yahweh, and he made a trench which would have held
1KI.18.33	And he arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces, and placed it on the wood.
1KI.18.34	He said, “Do it again!” They did it again. He said, “Do it a third time!” So they did it a third time. 
1KI.18.35	The water went all around the altar, and the trench also was filled with water. 
1KI.18.36	It happened at the offering of the evening oblation, Elijah the prophet went near, and he said, “O Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel; let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and that I have done all of these things by your words. 
1KI.18.37	Answer me, O Yahweh, answer me; that this people may know that you, O Yahweh, are God and that you have turned their hearts back again.” 
1KI.18.38	Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and it consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust; and the water which was in the trench it licked up! 
1KI.18.39	When all the people saw, they fell on their faces and said, “Yahweh, he is God! Yahweh, he is God!” 
1KI.18.40	Then Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; don’t let any man of them escape!” So they seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the wadi
1KI.18.41	Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of the noise of rain.” 
1KI.18.42	So Ahab went up to eat and to drink while Elijah went to the top of Carmel, bent down to the earth, and put his face between his knees. 
1KI.18.43	Then he said to his servant, “Please go and look in the direction of the sea.” So he went up and looked; then he said, “There is nothing.” Then he said, “Go back,” seven times. 
1KI.18.44	It happened that at the seventh time, he said, “Look, there is a small cloud, as the hand of a man, coming up from the sea.” Then Elijah said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Harness your horses and go down, lest the rain stop you.’ ” 
1KI.18.45	In no time
1KI.18.46	but the hand of Yahweh was on Elijah; he girded up his loins and ran before Ahab as one comes to Jezreel. 
1KI.19.1	Then Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. 
1KI.19.2	Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “Thus may the gods do to me, and may they add to it, surely at this time tomorrow I will make your life as the life of one of them!” 
1KI.19.3	Then he became afraid,
1KI.19.4	Then he went into the wilderness one day’s journey, and he went and sat under a certain broom tree. Then he asked Yahweh that he might die,
1KI.19.5	He lay down and fell asleep under a certain broom tree, and suddenly this angel was touching him and said to him, “Get up, eat!” 
1KI.19.6	He looked, and behold, a bread cake on hot coals was near his head and a jar of water, so he ate and drank. Then he did it again and lay down. 
1KI.19.7	The angel of Yahweh appeared a second time and touched him and said, “Get up, eat, for the journey is greater than you.” 
1KI.19.8	So he got up, ate, drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights up to Horeb, the mountain of God. 
1KI.19.9	He came to the cave there and spent the night there. Suddenly the word of Yahweh came to him and asked him, “Elijah, what are you doing here?”
1KI.19.10	Then he said, “I have been very zealous for Yahweh the God of hosts, for the Israelites
1KI.19.11	He
1KI.19.12	After the earthquake was a fire, but Yahweh was not in the fire. After the fire there was the sound of a gentle whisper. 
1KI.19.13	It happened at the moment Elijah heard, he covered his face with his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Suddenly a voice came to him and said, “Elijah, why are you here?”
1KI.19.14	He said, “I have been very zealous for Yahweh the God of Hosts, for the Israelites
1KI.19.15	Then Yahweh said to him, “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. Go and anoint Hazael as king over Aram; 
1KI.19.16	and Jehu son of Nimshi you shall anoint as king over Israel. You shall also anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-Meholah as prophet in your place. 
1KI.19.17	It shall be that the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall kill. 
1KI.19.18	I will leave in Israel seven thousand, all of the knees that have not bowed down to Baal and all of the mouths that have not kissed him.” 
1KI.19.19	So he went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat while he was plowing with twelve pairs of oxen before him. When he and the twelve passed Elijah, he threw his cloak on him. 
1KI.19.20	Then he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, “Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will go after you.” Then he said, “Go, return, for what I have done to you?” 
1KI.19.21	So he returned from after him, and he took a pair of oxen and slaughtered them, and with the yoke of the oxen he boiled the flesh and gave it to the people and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah and served him. 
1KI.20.1	Ben-Hadad king of Aram gathered all of his army, and thirty-two kings were with him, and horses and chariots. He went up and laid siege against Samaria and fought with it. 
1KI.20.2	He sent messengers to the city to Ahab king of Israel. 
1KI.20.3	He said to him, “Thus says Ben-Hadad: ‘Your silver and your gold are mine, and your women and your best sons are mine.’ ” 
1KI.20.4	Then the king of Israel answered and said, “As your word, my master the king; I am yours, and all that is mine is yours.” 
1KI.20.5	The messengers returned and said, “Thus says Ben-Hadad, saying, ‘I sent to you saying, “Your silver and gold are mine, and your women and your best sons you must give to me.” 
1KI.20.6	So at this time tomorrow, I will send my servants to you that they might search your house and the houses of your servants. All the desire of your eyes they will lay hands on
1KI.20.7	Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, “Please know and realize that this man is seeking trouble, for he sent to me for my women, my sons, my silver, and my gold, and I did not withhold anything from him.” 
1KI.20.8	All of the elders and all of the people said to him, “Do not listen and do not consent.” 
1KI.20.9	So he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, “Say to my lord the king, ‘All that you demanded from your servant at the first, I will do, but this thing I am not able to do.’ ” Then the messengers went and made a report to him.
1KI.20.10	Then Ben-Hadad sent to him and said, “Thus may the gods do to me and thus may they add if the dust of Samaria is sufficient for the hollow of a hand for all of the people who are at my feet.” 
1KI.20.11	The king of Israel answered and said, “Tell him, ‘Let not him who girds on his armor boast as one who takes off his armor.’ ” 
1KI.20.12	It happened at the moment he heard this word, he and the kings were drinking in the tents.
1KI.20.13	Suddenly a certain prophet approached Ahab king of Israel and said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Have you seen all this great crowd? Behold, I am giving it into your hand today, that you may know that I am Yahweh.’ ” 
1KI.20.14	Ahab said, “By whom?” And he said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘By the servants of the commanders of the provinces.’ ” He asked, “Who will begin the battle?” And he said, “You.” 
1KI.20.15	So he mustered the servants of the commanders of the provinces, and there were two hundred and thirty-two. After them he mustered all of the army, all the sons of Israel, seven thousand. 
1KI.20.16	They went out at noon while Ben-Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the tents, he and the thirty-two kings helping him. 
1KI.20.17	Then the servants of the commanders of the provinces went out first, and Ben-Hadad sent, and they reported to him, saying, “Men have come out from Samaria.” 
1KI.20.18	Then he said, “If they have come out for peace, seize them alive; and if they have come out for war, seize them alive.” 
1KI.20.19	But these had come out from the city, the servants of the commanders of the provinces, and the army that was after them. 
1KI.20.20	Each man killed his man, and the Arameans fled, so Israel pursued them, but Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse with cavalry. 
1KI.20.21	The king of Israel went out and attacked the horses and the chariots and defeated Aram with a great blow. 
1KI.20.22	Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and he said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself; consider well
1KI.20.23	The servants of the king of Aram said to him, “Their gods are gods of the mountains, therefore they were stronger than we.
1KI.20.24	Do this thing: remove the kings each from his post, and put a governor in their place. 
1KI.20.25	You must muster an army for yourself as the army you have lost,
1KI.20.26	It happened at the turning of the year that Ben-Hadad mustered Aram and went up to Aphek for the war with Israel. 
1KI.20.27	The Israelites
1KI.20.28	Then the man of God approached, and he spoke to the king of Israel, and he said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Because Aram has said, “Yahweh is a god of the mountains and not a god of the valleys,” ’ I will give all this great crowd into your hand that you may know that I am Yahweh.” 
1KI.20.29	These encamped opposite for seven days, and it happened on the seventh day that the battle began,
1KI.20.30	Then those who remained fled to Aphek, to the city, and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who had remained, so Ben-Hadad fled and went to the innermost rooms of the city. 
1KI.20.31	Then his servants said to him, “Please now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are kings of mercy. Let us now put sackcloth on around our waists and ropes on our heads. Then let us go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will let you live.”
1KI.20.32	So they tied sackcloth around their waists and ropes on their heads. Then they went to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’ ” And he said, “Is my brother still alive?” 
1KI.20.33	The men took this as a good omen and they quickly accepted it as true from him, and they said, “Your brother Ben-Hadad lives.” So he said, “Go, get him.” Ben-Hadad came out to him, and Ahab pulled him up on the chariot. 
1KI.20.34	Ben-Hadad said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I shall return. You may set up streets with stalls for yourself in Damascus just as my father set up in Samaria.” Then Ahab said, “On these terms
1KI.20.35	A certain man from the sons of the prophets said to his fellow countryman, “By the word of Yahweh, please strike me.” But the man refused to strike him. 
1KI.20.36	He said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, look, as you now are going from me, a lion will kill you.” When he went from beside him, the lion found him and killed him. 
1KI.20.37	Then he found another man and said, “Strike me, please,” so the man struck him sharply and wounded him. 
1KI.20.38	Then the prophet went and waited
1KI.20.39	As the king was passing by, he called to the king and said, “Your servant went out in the thick of the battle, and suddenly a man turned and brought a man to me and said, ‘Guard this man. If by any means he should be missed, it will be your life in his place, or you shall pay a talent of silver.’ 
1KI.20.40	It happened that your servant was busy here and there,
1KI.20.41	He quickly removed the headband from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him, that he was from the prophets. 
1KI.20.42	He said to him, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Because you have let the man I devoted for destruction go from your hand, your life shall be in place of his life and your people in place of his people.’ ” 
1KI.20.43	Then the king of Israel went to his house, sullen and angry, and he came to Samaria. 
1KI.21.1	It happened after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 
1KI.21.2	Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard that it may be mine for a garden of vegetable plants, because it is near, beside my house, and I will give to you a better vineyard in place of it. If it is better in your eyes, I will give you the money of its price.” 
1KI.21.3	Naboth said to Ahab, “Far be it from me from Yahweh that I should give the inheritance of my ancestors
1KI.21.4	Then Ahab went to his house, sullen and angry because of the word that Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him when he had said, “I will not give to you the inheritance of my ancestors.”
1KI.21.5	Then Jezebel his wife came to him, and she said to him, “What is this, that your spirit is sullen and you are not eating food?” 
1KI.21.6	Then he said to her, “When I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and asked him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money, or it you prefer, I will give you a vineyard in place of it,’ he said, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’ ” 
1KI.21.7	Jezebel his wife said to him, “Now, you rule
1KI.21.8	So she wrote letters in the name of Ahab and sealed them with his seal. She sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who were dwelling with Naboth in his city. 
1KI.21.9	She had written in the letters, saying, “Call a fast and seat Naboth at the head of the people. 
1KI.21.10	Seat two men, scoundrels,
1KI.21.11	The men of his city and the elders and nobles who were living in his city did according to what Jezebel had sent to them, as was written in the letters which she had sent to them. 
1KI.21.12	They called a fast, and they seated Naboth at the head of the people. 
1KI.21.13	Then the two men, scoundrels,
1KI.21.14	They sent to Jezebel saying, “Naboth has been stoned, and he is dead.” 
1KI.21.15	It happened at the moment Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and died, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Get up, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite which he had refused to give to you for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead.” 
1KI.21.16	When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it. 
1KI.21.17	The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 
1KI.21.18	“Arise, go down to meet Ahab the king of Israel who is in Samaria. Look in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession of it. 
1KI.21.19	You shall say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “Have you committed murder and also taken possession?” ’ You shall also say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth, the dogs will also lick your blood.” ’ ” 
1KI.21.20	Then Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, my enemy?” He said, “I have found you because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of Yahweh. 
1KI.21.21	‘Look, I am bringing disaster on you, and I will sweep away after you. I will cut off for Ahab every male
1KI.21.22	I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, because you made me angry
1KI.21.23	Moreover, concerning Jezebel, Yahweh has said, ‘The dogs will eat Jezebel in the outer rampart of Jezreel.’ 
1KI.21.24	The one who dies for Ahab in the city, the dogs will eat; the one who dies in the open country, the birds of heaven will eat.” 
1KI.21.25	Truly, there was no one like Ahab who had sold himself by doing evil in the eyes of Yahweh, whose wife Jezebel urged him on. 
1KI.21.26	Also, he acted very abominably by going after idols like all the Amorites had done whom Yahweh had driven out from before the Israelites.”
1KI.21.27	When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes and put sackcloth over his flesh, fasted, lay in the sackcloth, and went about dejectedly. 
1KI.21.28	Then the word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 
1KI.21.29	“Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring disaster in his days. I will bring the disaster on his house in the days of his son.” 
1KI.22.1	They lived three years, and there was no war between Aram and Israel. 
1KI.22.2	It happened in the third year, Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to the king of Israel, 
1KI.22.3	and the king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know Ramoth-Gilead belongs to us, and we are doing nothing about taking it from the hand of the king of Aram?” 
1KI.22.4	Then he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to the battle for Ramoth-Gilead?” Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am like you;
1KI.22.5	Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire for the word of Yahweh today.” 
1KI.22.6	Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and he said to them, “Shall I go against Ramoth-Gilead for the battle, or should I refrain?” Then they said, “Go up, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.” 
1KI.22.7	So Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no prophet of Yahweh here that we might still inquire from him?” 
1KI.22.8	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man to inquire from Yahweh, but I despise him, for he never prophesies anything good concerning me, but only bad: Micaiah the son of Imlah.” Then Jehoshaphat said, “The king should not say so.” 
1KI.22.9	The king of Israel summoned a certain court official, and he said, “Quickly fetch Micaiah son of Imlah.” 
1KI.22.10	The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were each sitting on his throne, dressed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them. 
1KI.22.11	Zedekiah son of Kenaanah made horns of iron for himself and said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘With these you shall gore the Arameans until finishing them.’ ” 
1KI.22.12	All of the prophets were likewise prophesying, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-Gilead and triumph, and Yahweh will give it into the hand of the king.” 
1KI.22.13	Then the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, “Please now, the words of the prophet are unanimously
1KI.22.14	Then Micaiah said, “As Yahweh lives,
1KI.22.15	When he came to the king, the king asked him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to the battle, or shall we refrain?” He said to him, “Go up and triumph, and Yahweh will give it into the hand of the king.” 
1KI.22.16	Then the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear that you shall not tell me anything but truth in the name of Yahweh?” 
1KI.22.17	So he said, “I saw all of Israel scattering to the mountains, like the sheep without a shepherd. Yahweh also said, ‘There are no masters for these, let them return in peace, each to his house.’ ” 
1KI.22.18	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not say to you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but disaster?” 
1KI.22.19	And he
1KI.22.20	And Yahweh said, ‘Who will entice Ahab so that he will go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead?’ Then this one was saying one thing and the other one was saying another.
1KI.22.21	Then a spirit came out and stood before Yahweh and said, ‘I will entice him,’ and Yahweh said to him, ‘How?’ 
1KI.22.22	He said, ‘I will go out and I will be a false spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And he
1KI.22.23	So then, see that Yahweh has placed a false spirit in the mouth of all of these your prophets, and Yahweh has spoken disaster concerning you.” 
1KI.22.24	Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah came near and slapped Micaiah on the cheek and said, “When did the Spirit of Yahweh pass from me to speak with you?” 
1KI.22.25	Then Micaiah said, “Behold, you are about to see on that day when you go from room to room
1KI.22.26	The king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the commander of the city and to Jehoash the son of the king; 
1KI.22.27	and say, ‘Thus says the king: “Put this fellow in the house of imprisonment and feed him reduced rations of food and water until I come in peace.” ’ ” 
1KI.22.28	Then Micaiah said, “If you indeed return in peace, then Yahweh has not spoken with me.” Then he said, “Let all the peoples hear!” 
1KI.22.29	Then the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-Gilead. 
1KI.22.30	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you wear your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and he went into the battle. 
1KI.22.31	The king of Aram commanded his thirty-two chariot commanders, saying, “You shall not fight with small or great, but only against the king of Israel, him alone!” 
1KI.22.32	When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely he is the king of Israel,” and they turned to fight against him, so Jehoshaphat called out. 
1KI.22.33	When the chariot commanders saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned away from him. 
1KI.22.34	But another man drew his bow fully and struck the king of Israel between the armor scales and the breastplate; so he said to his chariot driver, “Turn the chariot
1KI.22.35	The battle intensified on that day, and the king was being propped up in the chariot opposite Aram, but he died in the evening, and the blood of the wound ran out to the floor of the chariot. 
1KI.22.36	Then the shout passed through the camp about sunset, saying, “Each man to his city and each to his land!” 
1KI.22.37	So the king died, and they brought him
1KI.22.38	They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked his blood (now, the prostitutes washed themselves there) according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken. 
1KI.22.39	The remainder of the acts of Ahab and all that he did, and the ivory palace and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.22.40	So Ahab slept with his ancestors,
1KI.22.41	Jehoshaphat the son of Asa became king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 
1KI.22.43	He walked in all of the way of Asa his father, and he did not turn aside from it, doing right in the eyes of Yahweh.
1KI.22.44	 But, Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.45	The remainder of the acts of Jehoshaphat, his powerful deeds he did, and how he fought, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 
1KI.22.46	The remainder of the male shrine prostitutes who were left over in the days of Asa his father he exterminated from the land. 
1KI.22.47	There was not a king in Edom; a governor served as king. 
1KI.22.48	Jehoshaphat built
1KI.22.49	Then Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships,” but Jehoshaphat was not willing. 
1KI.22.50	And Jehoshaphat slept with his ancestors
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. 
1KI.22.52	He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and he went in the way of his father and his mother and in the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat who caused Israel to sin. 
1KI.22.53	He served Baal and bowed down to him; and he provoked Yahweh the God of Israel according to all that his father did. 
2KI.1.1	Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. 
2KI.1.2	Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice in his upper room, which was in Samaria, and he was injured. So he sent messengers, and he said to them, “Go, inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, if I will survive this injury.” 
2KI.1.3	Then the angel of Yahweh spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, “Get up, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and speak to them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?’ 
2KI.1.4	Therefore, thus says Yahweh, ‘The bed upon which you have gone, you will not come down from it, but you shall surely die.’ ” So Elijah went. 
2KI.1.5	When the messengers returned to him, he asked them, “Why have you returned?” 
2KI.1.6	Then they said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and he said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you and speak to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-Zebub the god of Ekron? Therefore the bed upon which you have gone, you will not come down from it, for you will surely die.’ ” ’ ” 
2KI.1.7	Then he spoke to them, “What was the manner of the man who came up to meet you and spoke to you all these things?” 
2KI.1.8	They answered him, “A hairy man
2KI.1.9	So Ahaziah
2KI.1.10	Then Elijah answered and said to the commander of the fifty, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty!” Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty. 
2KI.1.11	So he again sent
2KI.1.12	Then Elijah answered and said to them, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty!” Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty. 
2KI.1.13	So he again sent
2KI.1.14	Behold, fire from heaven came down and consumed the first two commanders of fifty and their fifties, so then let my life be precious in your eyes.” 
2KI.1.15	Then the angel of Yahweh spoke to Elijah, “Go down with him. Do not be afraid because of him.” So he got up and went down with him to the king, 
2KI.1.16	and he said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron—is it because there is no God in Israel from whom to inquire his word?—therefore the bed upon which you went, you shall not come down from it, for you shall surely die.’ ” 
2KI.1.17	So he died, according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken, and Joram became king in his place in the second year of Joram the son of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, because he had no son. 
2KI.1.18	The remainder of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.2.1	When Yahweh was about to take Elijah up in the storm to heaven, Elijah and Elisha went from Gilgal. 
2KI.2.2	Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for Yahweh has sent me up to Bethel.” Elisha said, “As Yahweh lives
2KI.2.3	Then the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha, and they said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh is going to take your master from you
2KI.2.4	Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please stay here because Yahweh has sent me to Jericho.” And he said, “As Yahweh lives
2KI.2.5	Then the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho came near to Elisha, and they said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh is going to take your master from you
2KI.2.6	Then Elijah said to him, “Please stay here, because Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan.” He said, “As Yahweh lives
2KI.2.7	Then fifty men from the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite them at a distance while the two of them stood by the Jordan. 
2KI.2.8	Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the water. It divided in two,
2KI.2.9	After they crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I may do for you before I am taken away from you.” Then Elisha said, “Please let there come to me a double portion of your spirit.” 
2KI.2.10	He said, “What you ask is difficult. If you see me being taken from you, it will be so for you, but if not, it will not happen.” 
2KI.2.11	Then they were walking, talking as they went. Suddenly a fiery chariot with horses of fire appeared and separated between the two of them. Elijah went up in the storm to the heavens 
2KI.2.12	while Elisha was watching and crying out, “My father, my father; the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!” But he could not see him any longer, and he grasped his clothes and tore them in two pieces. 
2KI.2.13	Then he picked up Elijah’s cloak that had fallen off of him, and he returned and stood on the bank of the Jordan. 
2KI.2.14	He took Elijah’s cloak that had fallen from upon him and struck the water. Then he said, “Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?” So he also struck the water, and it divided in two,
2KI.2.15	When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho saw him from the other side, they declared, “The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha,” and they came to meet him and bowed down to him to the ground. 
2KI.2.16	Then they said to him, “Look, there are with your servants fifty able men. Please let them go and look for your master, lest the Spirit of Yahweh has lifted him up and thrown him on one of the mountains or into one of the valleys,” but he said, “You must not send them.” 
2KI.2.17	But they urged him until embarrassing him, so he said, “Send them.” So they sent fifty men, and they looked for three days, but they could not find him. 
2KI.2.18	Then they returned to him while he was staying in Jericho. He said to them, “Did I not tell you not to go?” 
2KI.2.19	The men of the city said to Elisha, “Please now, the location of the city is good, as my master can see, but the water is bad and the land unproductive.” 
2KI.2.20	So he said, “Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him. 
2KI.2.21	Then he went out to the spring of waters and threw the salt into it there and said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘I hereby purify these waters; let there be no longer any death or unproductiveness from it.’ ” 
2KI.2.22	Then the waters were purified until this very day according to the word of Elisha that he spoke. 
2KI.2.23	Then he went up from there to Bethel; as he was going up along the way, young boys came out from the city and mocked at him and said to him, “Go up, baldhead; go up, baldhead!” 
2KI.2.24	When he turned around and saw them, he cursed them in the name of Yahweh. Then two bears came out of the forest and mauled forty-two boys among them. 
2KI.2.25	Then he went from there to Mount Carmel and from there he returned to Samaria. 
2KI.3.1	Now Joram the son of Ahab had become king over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah. He reigned twelve years 
2KI.3.2	and did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, yet not as his father or his mother, as he removed the stone pillars of Baal that his father had made. 
2KI.3.3	But he did cling to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who caused Israel to sin, and he did not depart from it. 
2KI.3.4	Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and he used to deliver to the king of Israel a hundred thousand male lambs and a hundred thousand wool rams. 
2KI.3.5	It happened that when Ahab died, Mesha king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
2KI.3.6	So King Joram went out on that day from Samaria, and he mustered all of Israel. 
2KI.3.7	He went and sent a message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab for the battle?” And he said, “I will go up. I am like you;
2KI.3.8	Then he said, “Which way shall we go up?” And he answered, “By way of the wilderness of Edom.” 
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel and the king of Judah and the king of Edom went around, a way of seven days, but there was no water for the army or for the animals which were with them.
2KI.3.10	Then the king of Israel said, “Aha, Yahweh has called for these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.” 
2KI.3.11	Then Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of Yahweh here that we might inquire guidance from Yahweh?” One of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, “Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.”
2KI.3.12	Jehoshaphat said, “The word of Yahweh is with him.” So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him. 
2KI.3.13	Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What do we have in common?
2KI.3.14	Then Elisha said, “As Yahweh of hosts lives,
2KI.3.15	But now, bring me a musician.” It happened that at the moment the musician played, the hand of Yahweh came upon him. 
2KI.3.16	He said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Make this wadi full of cisterns,’
2KI.3.17	for thus says Yahweh, ‘You will see neither wind nor rain, yet this wadi will be full of water; and you and all of your livestock and your animals shall drink.’ 
2KI.3.18	And since this is too trivial in the eyes of Yahweh, he will also give Moab into your hand, 
2KI.3.19	and you shall defeat every fortified city, every choice city, and you shall fell every good tree. All of the springs of water you shall stop up, and every tract of good land you shall ruin with the stones.” 
2KI.3.20	It happened in the morning about the time of the morning offering, that water was suddenly coming from the direction of Edom and the land was filled with water. 
2KI.3.21	Now all of Moab had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, and all who were fighting age and up
2KI.3.22	When they arose early in the morning, the sun shone on the waters, and Moab saw the waters from the opposite side as red as blood. 
2KI.3.23	Then they said, “This is blood! Certainly the kings have fought one another, and each has killed his neighbor. Now, to the war booty, O Moab!” 
2KI.3.24	But when they came to the camp of Israel, Israel stood up and killed Moab, so that they fled from before them. They came at her and defeated Moab. 
2KI.3.25	The cities they tore down, on every good tract of land they threw stones until it was filled up, every spring of water they stopped up, and every good tree they felled. They let the stone walls at Kir Hareseth remain, but the slingers surrounded and attacked it. 
2KI.3.26	When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too heavy for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew the sword to break through to the king of Edom, but they were not able. 
2KI.3.27	He took his firstborn son who was to become king in his place and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. Great wrath came upon Israel, and they withdrew from him and returned to the land. 
2KI.4.1	A certain woman from the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my husband is dead. Now you know that your servant was a fearer of Yahweh, but the creditor came to take two of my children for himself as slaves. 
2KI.4.2	Elisha asked her, “What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?” Then she said, “Your servant has nothing in the house except a jar of olive oil.” 
2KI.4.3	Then he said to her, “Go, ask for yourself some containers from the streets, from all your neighbors. You must collect as many empty containers as you can!
2KI.4.4	You must also go and shut the door behind you and your children, and you must pour out oil into all of these containers and set the filled ones aside.” 
2KI.4.5	So she went from him, and she shut the door behind her and her children. They were bringing containers to her, and she kept pouring. 
2KI.4.6	It happened that when the containers were full, she said to her son, “Bring near me another container,” but he said to her, “There is not another container.” Then the olive oil stopped flowing. 
2KI.4.7	So she came and told the man of God, and he said, “Go, sell the olive oil and repay your debt. You and your sons can live on what is left over.” 
2KI.4.8	It happened one day that Elisha passed through to Shunem where there was a wealthy woman, and she urged him to eat bread; so it happened each time he passed through, he would stop there to eat. 
2KI.4.9	She said to her husband, “Please now, I know that he is a holy man of God who is passing our way
2KI.4.10	let us make a small enclosed room upstairs and put a bed, table, chair, and lampstand there for him, so that when he comes to us, he can turn and stay there. 
2KI.4.11	One day it happened that he came there and went to the upper room and lay down there. 
2KI.4.12	He said to Gehazi his servant, “Call to this Shunammite,” so he called to her, and she stood before him. 
2KI.4.13	He said to him, “Please say to her, ‘Look, you took all this trouble, showing care for us; what is there for me to do for you? To speak for you to the king or to the commander of the army?’ ” She said, “I am living among my people.” 
2KI.4.14	Then he said, “What may be done for her?” Gehazi said, “Well, she has no son, and her husband is old.” 
2KI.4.15	And he said, “Call for her,” so he called for her and she stood in the doorway. 
2KI.4.16	And he said, “At this time next spring,
2KI.4.17	But the woman conceived, and she bore a son in the spring,
2KI.4.18	The child grew older, and it happened one day that he went out to his father and to the reapers. 
2KI.4.19	Then he said to his father, “My head, my head!” So he said to the servant, “Carry him to his mother.” 
2KI.4.20	So they carried him and brought him to his mother; he sat on her lap until noon and then died. 
2KI.4.21	She went up, laid him on the bed of the man of God, closed the door, and went out behind it. 
2KI.4.22	She called to her husband and said, “Please send one of the servants and one of the female donkeys for me, so that I can go quickly up to the man of God and return.” 
2KI.4.23	And he said, “Why are you going to him today? It is neither the new moon nor the Sabbath!” And she said, “Peace.” 
2KI.4.24	She saddled the female donkey, and she said to her servant, “Drive along and go; you must not hold me back from riding, unless I tell you.” 
2KI.4.25	So she went and came to the man of God by Mount Carmel. It happened when the man of God saw her at a distance,
2KI.4.26	Now, please run to meet her and ask her, ‘Is it peace for you? Is it peace for your husband? Is it peace for the boy?’ ” She said, “Peace.” 
2KI.4.27	So she came to the man of God at the mountain, and she caught hold of his feet. Then Gehazi came near to push her away, but the man of God said, “Let her alone, for her soul is bitter, and Yahweh has hidden it from me and has not told me.” 
2KI.4.28	Then she said, “Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say that you must not mislead me?” 
2KI.4.29	Then he said to Gehazi, “Gird up your loins and take my staff in your hand and go. If you meet anyone, you must not greet them; if anyone greets you, you must not answer them. You must put my staff on the face of the boy.” 
2KI.4.30	Then the mother of the boy said, “As Yahweh lives
2KI.4.31	Gehazi crossed over before them, and he put the staff on the face of the boy; but there was no sound, and there was no sign of life, so he returned to meet him. He told him, saying, “The boy did not wake up.” 
2KI.4.32	When Elisha came to the house, here was the boy dead, lying on his bed. 
2KI.4.33	He went and closed the door behind the two of them and prayed to Yahweh. 
2KI.4.34	Then he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his palms on his palms. As he bent down over him, the flesh of the boy became warm. 
2KI.4.35	He returned and went to and fro
2KI.4.36	Elisha called to Gehazi and said, “Call this Shunammite.” So he called her and she came to him; then he said, “Pick up your son.” 
2KI.4.37	She came and fell at his feet and bowed down to the ground; then she picked up her son and went out. 
2KI.4.38	So Elisha returned to Gilgal. Now the famine was in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him. He said to his servant, put on the large pot and cook a stew for the sons of the prophets. 
2KI.4.39	One went out to the field to gather herbs, and he found a wild vine
2KI.4.40	They served the men to eat, but when they ate from the stew, they cried out and said, “There is death in the pot, O man of God!” They were not able to eat it. 
2KI.4.41	Then he said, “Bring some flour,” and he threw it into the pot. He then said, “Serve the people and let them eat.” There was nothing harmful in the pot. 
2KI.4.42	A man came from Baal-Shalishah and brought food to the man of God: firstfruits and twenty loaves of barley bread, with ripe grain in his sack. He said, “Give it to the people and let them eat.” 
2KI.4.43	Then his servant said, “How can I set this before a hundred men?” He said, “Give it to the people and let them eat, for thus Yahweh says, ‘They shall eat and have some left over.’ ” 
2KI.4.44	So he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of Yahweh. 
2KI.5.1	Now Naaman was the commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man before his master and highly regarded,
2KI.5.2	When the Arameans went on a raid, they brought back a young girl from the land of Israel, and she came into the service of
2KI.5.3	She said to her mistress, “If only my lord would come before the prophet who is in Samaria; then he would cure his skin disease.”
2KI.5.4	He came and told his master, saying, “Thus and so the girl who is from the land of Israel said.” 
2KI.5.5	So the king of Aram said, “Go, I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” He went and took with him
2KI.5.6	So he brought the letter of the king to Israel, saying, “Now, when this letter comes to you, I have just sent Naaman my servant to you that you may cure him from his skin disease.” 
2KI.5.7	It happened that when the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, “Am I God to cause death or to give life? This man is sending a man to me to cure his disease. Indeed! But know and see that he seeks an opportunity against me.” 
2KI.5.8	It happened that as soon as Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent to the king, saying, “Why did you tear your clothes? Please may he come to me, that he might know that there is a prophet in Israel.” 
2KI.5.9	Then Naaman came with his horses and his chariots, and he stopped at the doorway of the house of Elisha. 
2KI.5.10	Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go, you must wash seven times in the Jordan, then your flesh shall return to you, and you shall be clean.” 
2KI.5.11	But Naaman became angry and he went and said, “Look, I said to myself, ‘Surely he will come out, stand, call upon the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hands over the spot; then he would take away the skin disease.’ 
2KI.5.12	Are not the Abana and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all of the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them that I may be clean?” Then he turned and left in anger. 
2KI.5.13	But his servants came near and spoke to him and said, “My father, if the prophet had spoken a difficult thing to you to do, would you not have done it? Why not even when he says to you, ‘Wash and you shall be clean’?” 
2KI.5.14	So he went down and plunged into the Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh returned as the flesh of a small boy, and he was clean. 
2KI.5.15	When he returned to the man of God, he and all of his army, he came and stood before him and said, “Please now, I know that there is no God in all of the world except in Israel. So then, please take a gift from your servant.” 
2KI.5.16	And he said, “As Yahweh lives,
2KI.5.17	Then Naaman said, “If not, then please let a load of soil on a pair of mules be given to your servants, for your servant will never again bring a burnt offering and sacrifice to other gods, but only to Yahweh. 
2KI.5.18	As far as this matter, may Yahweh pardon your servant when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he is leaning himself on my arm, that I also bow down in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down in the house of Rimmon, may Yahweh please pardon your servant in this matter.” 
2KI.5.19	He said to him, “Go in peace,” so he went from him a short distance.
2KI.5.20	But Gehazi the servant of Elisha, the man of God, thought, “Look, my master has refrained from taking what this Aramean Naaman brought from his hand. As Yahweh lives,
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi pursued after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he jumped off his chariot to meet him and asked him, “Is it peace?” 
2KI.5.22	He said, “Peace. My master has sent me saying, ‘Look, just now
2KI.5.23	Then Naaman said, “Be prepared to accept two talents.” So he urged him and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing and gave it to two of his servants and they carried it before him. 
2KI.5.24	When he came to the citadel, he took them from their hand and put them in the house, then sent away the men so that they went. 
2KI.5.25	When he went and stood by his master, Elisha asked him, “From where have you come, Gehazi?” And he said, “Your servant has not gone anywhere.”
2KI.5.26	Then he said to him, “Did not my heart go with you as the man turned from on his chariot to meet you? Is it time to take silver, clothes, olive orchards, vineyards, sheep, oxen, male slaves, and female slaves? 
2KI.5.27	The skin disease of Naaman shall cling to you and to your offspring forever.” Then he went out from before him having a skin disease like the snow. 
2KI.6.1	Then the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “Please look; the place where we are living before you is too cramped for us. 
2KI.6.2	Let us please go to the Jordan and each bring from there one log that we might make a place there for us to live.” Then he said, “Do so.” 
2KI.6.3	Then a certain one said, “Please be prepared and go with your servants,” and he said, “I will go.” 
2KI.6.4	He went with them, and they went to the Jordan, and they cut down the trees. 
2KI.6.5	It happened as the one was felling the log, that the iron ax fell into the water. He called out and said, “Oh, no! My master, it was borrowed!” 
2KI.6.6	Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” So he showed him the place, and then he cut off a stick and threw it there and made the iron ax float. 
2KI.6.7	Then he said, “Pick it up for yourself,” so he stretched out his hand and took it. 
2KI.6.8	The king of Aram was fighting with Israel, so he consulted with his officers, saying, “My camp is at such and such a place.”
2KI.6.9	Then the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, “Take care while crossing over to this place, because the Arameans are descending there.” 
2KI.6.10	So the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God said to him and warned him, so he was on guard there continually.
2KI.6.11	Then the heart of the king of Aram was stormy because of this matter, so he called his servants and said to them, “Can you not tell me who among us sides with the king of Israel?”
2KI.6.12	Then one of his servants said, “No, my lord the king, but Elisha the prophet who is in Israel tells the king of Israel things which you speak in your own bedchamber.”
2KI.6.13	Then he said, “Go and see where he is so that I can send and capture him.” Then he was told to him, “Look, he is in Dothan.” 
2KI.6.14	So he sent horses, chariots, and an oppressing army there. They arrived at night and surrounded the town. 
2KI.6.15	The attendant of the man of God arose early and went out, and look, the army was surrounding the city with horses and chariots. His servant said to him, “Oh no, my master! What shall we do?” 
2KI.6.16	And he said, “Don’t be afraid, for more are with us than are with them.” 
2KI.6.17	Then Elisha prayed and said, “O Yahweh, please open his eyes that he may see,” and Yahweh opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw, and look, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. 
2KI.6.18	They came down to him, and Elisha prayed to Yahweh and said, “Please strike this people with blindness,” so he struck them with blindness as Elisha had spoken.
2KI.6.19	Then Elisha said to them, “This is not the way and this is not the city. Come after me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” Then he brought them to Samaria. 
2KI.6.20	It happened at the moment they came to Samaria, Elisha said, “O Yahweh, open the eyes of these that they may see,” so Yahweh opened their eyes, and they saw, and look, the middle of Samaria! 
2KI.6.21	Then the king of Israel said to Elisha when he saw them, “Shall I kill them? Shall I kill, my father?” 
2KI.6.22	And he said, “You shall not kill. Would you kill those whom you took captive with the sword or with the bow? Put food and water before them that they may eat and drink and then go to their master.” 
2KI.6.23	So he made a great feast for them, and they ate and drank; then he sent them, and they went to their master. And the bands of the Arameans did not come again into the land of Israel. 
2KI.6.24	It happened after this that Ben-Hadad king of Aram assembled all of his army and marched up and laid siege against Samaria. 
2KI.6.25	There was a great famine in Samaria, and behold, a siege was against it, until the head of a donkey went for eighty shekels of silver, and one fourth of the measure of the dung of doves went for five shekels of silver. 
2KI.6.26	It happened that the king of Israel was crossing over on the wall, and a woman called out to him, saying, “Help, my lord the king!” 
2KI.6.27	He said, “No, let Yahweh help you. How
2KI.6.28	The king said to her, “What is the problem?”
2KI.6.29	So we cooked my son and ate him, and I said to her the next day, ‘Give your son that we may eat him.’ But she had hidden her son.” 
2KI.6.30	It happened that when the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes. Now he had been walking on the wall, and the people saw, and behold, sackcloth was over his flesh underneath. 
2KI.6.31	Then he said, “May God do to me and thus may he add, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today!” 
2KI.6.32	Now Elisha was sitting in his house and the elders were sitting with him, and the king dispatched a man from before him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, “Did you see that this son of a murderer has sent to remove my head? Look, when the messenger comes, close the door; and you must hold the door closed against him.
2KI.6.33	While he was still speaking with them, suddenly the messenger was coming down to him, and he said, “Look this trouble is from Yahweh. Why should I wait for Yahweh any longer?” 
2KI.7.1	Elisha said, “Hear the word of Yahweh: ‘Thus says Yahweh, “At this time tomorrow a seah of wheat bread flour will sell for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria.’ ” 
2KI.7.2	Then the officer on whom the king relied
2KI.7.3	Now four men who had a skin disease were at the entrance of the gate, and they said to each other,
2KI.7.4	If we say, ‘Let us go into the city,’ the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; but if we sit here, we shall die. So then, come, let us fall into the camp of the Arameans. If they let us live, we shall live; but if they kill us, then we shall die.” 
2KI.7.5	So they got up at dusk to go to the camp of the Arameans. They went up to the edge of the camp of the Arameans, and look, there was no man there! 
2KI.7.6	Now the Lord had caused the camp of the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots, the sound of horses, and the sound of a great army. So they said to one another,
2KI.7.7	So they got up and fled at dusk and left their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and the camp as it was, and they fled for their lives. 
2KI.7.8	When these who had the skin disease came to the edge of the camp, they went into a certain tent and they ate, drank, and took from there silver and gold and clothes. Then they went and hid them, then returned and came to another tent, and they took from there and went and hid them. 
2KI.7.9	Then they said to one another,
2KI.7.10	When they came, they called to the gatekeepers of the city and told them, saying, “We came to the camp of the Arameans, and behold, there was no man or the voice of a man there! Only the horses and the donkeys were tied up, and the tents were left as they were.” 
2KI.7.11	Then the gatekeepers called and told it inside the house of the king. 
2KI.7.12	The king got up in the night and said to his servants, “Please let me tell you what the Arameans have done to us. The Arameans know that we are hungry, so they went out from the camp to hide in the field, saying, ‘When they go out from the city, we shall seize them alive and go into the city.’ ” 
2KI.7.13	Then one of his servants replied and said, “Please let them take five of the remaining horses which remain in the city; behold, they are like all of the multitude of Israel that remain in it; they are like all the multitude of Israel who have perished. Let us send and see.” 
2KI.7.14	So he took two charioteer horsemen, and the king sent after the camp of the Arameans, saying, “Go, find out,” 
2KI.7.15	and they went after them to the Jordan. Look, all of the way was littered with clothes and equipment which the Arameans had thrown away in their haste. Then the messengers returned and told the king. 
2KI.7.16	So the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. A seah of wheat flour went for a shekel and two seahs of barley went for a shekel according to the word of Yahweh. 
2KI.7.17	Then the king appointed the officer he was depending on over the gate, but the people trampled him and he died, according to that which the man of God had said which he spoke when the king came down to him. 
2KI.7.18	It happened as the man of God spoke to the king, saying, “Two seahs of barley shall be sold for a shekel and a seah of wheat flour for a shekel at this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria.” 
2KI.7.19	Then the officer had replied to the man of God and said, “Look, even if Yahweh is opening the windows in heaven, could this thing happen?” And he had said, “Look you are about to see it with your eyes, but you will not eat from it.” 
2KI.7.20	So it had happened to him; the people trampled him in the gate and he died. 
2KI.8.1	Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Get up and go, you and your household, and dwell as an alien wherever you can, for Yahweh has called for a famine, and it will come to the land for seven years.” 
2KI.8.2	So the woman got up and did according to the word of the man of God. She and her household went and dwelt as an alien in the land of the Philistines for seven years. 
2KI.8.3	It happened at the end of seven years that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines and went out to appeal to the king for her household and for her properties.
2KI.8.4	Now the king was speaking to Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please tell me all of the great things which Elisha has done.” 
2KI.8.5	It happened that as he was telling the king how he had restored the dead to life, suddenly the woman whose son he had restored to life was crying out to the king about her household and about her field. Then Gehazi said, “My lord the king, this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life!” 
2KI.8.6	So the king asked the woman, and she told him. So the king appointed for her a certain court official, saying, “Restore all that is hers and all the yield of the field from the day she left the land up to now.” 
2KI.8.7	Elisha came to Damascus. Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill, and he was told, “The man of God has come up here.” 
2KI.8.8	Then the king said to Hazael, “Take a gift in your hand and go meet the man of God. Inquire of Yahweh from him, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this illness?’ ” 
2KI.8.9	So Hazael went to meet him and took a gift in his hand of all of the good things of Damascus, a load on each of forty camels, and he came and stood before him. Then he said, “Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent me to you, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this illness?’ ” 
2KI.8.10	Elisha said to him, “Go; say to him, ‘You shall certainly recover,’ but Yahweh has shown me that he certainly will die.” 
2KI.8.11	Then the man fixed his gaze and stared at him
2KI.8.12	Then Hazael asked, “Why is my lord crying?” He said, “Because I know what evil you will do to the Israelites.
2KI.8.13	Then Hazael said, “But how could your servant, who is like a dog, do this great thing?” Elisha said, “Yahweh has shown me that you are to be king over Aram.” 
2KI.8.14	So he departed from Elisha and came to his master. He asked him, “What did Elisha say to you.” So he said, “He said to me that you will certainly recover.” 
2KI.8.15	On the next day, he took the bed cover, dipped it in the water, and spread it over his face so that he died. Then Hazael became king in his place. 
2KI.8.16	Now in the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab, king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Joram son of Jehoshaphat became the king of Judah.
2KI.8.17	He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
2KI.8.18	He walked in the way of the kings of Israel as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab became his wife, and he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. 
2KI.8.19	Yet Yahweh was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant, as he had promised to give him a lamp for his sons always. 
2KI.8.20	In his days, Edom rebelled against the rule
2KI.8.21	So Joram crossed over to Zair and all the chariots with him. It happened that he arose by night and attacked Edom who had surrounded him and the commanders of the chariots; but the army fled to their tents. 
2KI.8.22	So Edom has rebelled against the rule
2KI.8.23	The remainder of the acts of Joram and all that he did, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.8.24	So Joram slept with his ancestors,
2KI.8.25	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Joram became king of Judah. 
2KI.8.26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Athaliah daughter of Omri, king of Israel. 
2KI.8.27	He walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, as the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab. 
2KI.8.28	He went with Joram the son of Ahab for the battle against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-Gilead, and the Arameans wounded Joram. 
2KI.8.29	Joram the king returned to Jezreel to heal from the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted at Ramah when Hazael king of Aram fought him. Ahaziah the son of Joram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, for he was ill. 
2KI.9.1	Now Elisha the prophet called for one of the sons of the prophets, and he said to him, “Gird your loins, and take this flask of olive oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead. 
2KI.9.2	Go there and look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi. Go, for you must cause him to arise from among his brothers, and you must bring him into an inner room.
2KI.9.3	You must take the flask of olive oil and pour it out on his head. You must say, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “I hereby anoint you as king over Israel.” ’ Then you must open the door and flee; do not linger!” 
2KI.9.4	So the young man, servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-Gilead. 
2KI.9.5	He came, and look, the commanders of the army were sitting there. He said, “I have a word for you, O commander!” Jehu said, “For whom? For all of us?” And he said, “For you, O commander!” 
2KI.9.6	He got up and went to the house, and poured the olive oil on his head and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘I hereby anoint you as king over the people of Yahweh, over Israel. 
2KI.9.7	You will destroy the house of Ahab your master, and you will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all of the servants of Yahweh, from the hand of Jezebel. 
2KI.9.8	All of the house of Ahab will perish, and I shall cut off all males
2KI.9.9	I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. 
2KI.9.10	The dogs will eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and there shall not be anyone to bury her.’ ”
2KI.9.11	Then Jehu came out to the officers of his master, and they said to him, “Peace? Why did this madman come to you?” And he said to them, “You know the man and his foolish talk.” 
2KI.9.12	Then they said, “Liar. Please tell us.” He said, “Thus and so
2KI.9.13	So they hastened each one to take his cloak, and they spread them under him on the bare steps, blew on the trumpet, and said, “Jehu is king!” 
2KI.9.14	So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Now Joram was keeping guard in Ramoth-Gilead, he and all of Israel, because of the threat
2KI.9.15	But Joram the king had returned to heal in Jezreel from the wound which the Arameans had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Aram. Jehu said, “If this is what you want,
2KI.9.16	Jehu mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there, and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to visit Joram. 
2KI.9.17	Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu when he came, and he said, “I see a company.” Joram said, “Take a horseman and send him to meet them.” And he said, “Is it peace?” 
2KI.9.18	So the rider of the horse went out to meet him, and he said, “Thus the king asks, ‘Is it peace?’ ” Then Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace?
2KI.9.19	Then he sent out a second horseman, and he came to them and said, “Thus the king asks, ‘Is it peace?’ ” Then Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace?
2KI.9.20	So the sentinel reported, saying, “He went up to them, but he did not return, and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives with madness.” 
2KI.9.21	Then Joram said, “Get ready,” so he got his chariot ready. Joram king of Israel went out, and Ahaziah king of Judah, each with his chariot. They went out to meet Jehu, and they found him at the tract of land of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
2KI.9.22	When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, “Is it peace?” And he said, “What peace is there while the prostitutions of your mother Jezebel and her sorceries are numerous?” 
2KI.9.23	Joram turned his chariot
2KI.9.24	Then Jehu drew his bow
2KI.9.25	He said to Bidkar his third servant, “Lift him out and throw him on the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite, for remember, you and I were with the pair of chariots behind Ahab his father when Yahweh pronounced this oracle against him: 
2KI.9.26	‘ “Since I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his children yesterday,” declares Yahweh, “I will requite it for you in this tract of land,” declares Yahweh.’ So then lift him out and throw him on the tract of land according to the word of Yahweh.” 
2KI.9.27	When Ahaziah king of Judah saw, he fled the way of Beth-Haggen. Jehu pursued after him and said, “Shoot him also, in the chariot.” They shot him at the ascent of Gur which is in Ibleam, and he fled to Megiddo, but he died there. 
2KI.9.28	Then his officers carried him to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his tomb with his ancestors
2KI.9.29	In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah. 
2KI.9.30	When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it, so she painted her eyes with black eye paint and adorned her head and looked through the window. 
2KI.9.31	Now Jehu had come in the gate, so she said, “Is it peace, O Zimri, murderer of his master?” 
2KI.9.32	When he lifted up his face to the window, he asked, “Who is with me?” Two or three eunuchs looked down to him. 
2KI.9.33	So he said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down, and her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled her. 
2KI.9.34	Then he came and ate and drank, and said, “Please take care of this cursed one and bury her, for she is the daughter of a king.” 
2KI.9.35	When they went to bury her, they could not find her, except the skull, the feet, and the palms of the hands. 
2KI.9.36	They returned and told him, and he said, “This is the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘On the plot of ground of Jezreel, the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel.’ ” 
2KI.9.37	So the dead body of Jezebel became dung on the surface spread on the field in the plot of ground of Jezreel, so one cannot say, “This is Jezebel.” 
2KI.10.1	Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria, and Jehu wrote letters, and he sent them to Samaria to the officials of Jezreel, to the elders and to the guardians of Ahab, saying, 
2KI.10.2	“Now, when this letter comes to you and your master’s sons are with you, the chariots are with you, the horses, a fortified city, and weapons, 
2KI.10.3	then you must select the best and the most suitable from the sons of your master, and you must place him on the throne of his father, and they must fight for the house of your masters.” 
2KI.10.4	But they were very afraid, and they said, “Look, two kings could not stand before him; how can we stand?” 
2KI.10.5	So whoever was over the house, and whoever was over the city, and the elders and the guardians sent to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants; all that you say to us, we shall do. We shall not make anyone a king. Do what is good in your eyes.” 
2KI.10.6	Then he wrote to them a second letter, saying, “If you are for me, and you are listening to my voice, take the heads of the men of the sons of your master and come to me at this time tomorrow at Jezreel.” Now the sons of the king, seventy men, were with the leaders of the city who were raising them. 
2KI.10.7	When the letter came to them, they took the sons of the king, and they killed seventy men. Then they put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel. 
2KI.10.8	Then the messenger came and told him, saying, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons,” and he said, “Put them in two piles at the entrance of the gate until morning.” 
2KI.10.9	It happened in the morning that he went out, stood, and said to all of the people, “You are righteous. Look, I conspired against my master and killed him. But who killed all of these? 
2KI.10.10	Know then that the word of Yahweh will not fail
2KI.10.11	Then Jehu killed all of the remainder of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, all of his leaders, his close friends, and his priests, until there was no survivor left for him. 
2KI.10.12	Then he arose and went and came to Samaria. On the way, he was at Beth-Eked of the shepherds, 
2KI.10.13	and Jehu met the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah. He asked, “Who are you?” They said, “We are the brothers of Ahaziah; we came down for the peace of the king’s children and the children of the queen.” 
2KI.10.14	Then he said, “Seize them alive!” So they seized them alive but then slaughtered them at the cistern of Beth-Eked, forty-two men. He did not allow any of them to survive. 
2KI.10.15	Next he went from there and found Jehonadab the son of Recab to meet him. He greeted him and asked him, “Is your heart right with me as my heart is with you?”
2KI.10.16	Then he said, “Come with me! Look at my zeal for Yahweh!” So he let him ride in his chariot. 
2KI.10.17	Then he came to Samaria and killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria until he wiped them out according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken to Elijah. 
2KI.10.18	Then Jehu assembled all of the people and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will worship him greatly. 
2KI.10.19	So then, summon to me all of the prophets of Baal and all of his servants and his priests; no man should fail to come, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come shall not live!” Now Jehu was acting with cunning in order to destroy the servants of Baal. 
2KI.10.20	Then Jehu said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal!” So they proclaimed it. 
2KI.10.21	Jehu sent word through all of Israel, and all of the servants of Baal came; there did not remain a man who did not come. They came to the house of Baal so that the house of Baal was filled from wall to wall.
2KI.10.22	He said to the one who was over the wardrobe, “Bring out clothing for all of the servants of Baal.” So he brought the clothing out for them. 
2KI.10.23	Then Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Recab came to the temple of Baal, and he said to the servants of Baal, “Search and see that there is none of the servants of Yahweh here with you; only those who serve Baal.” 
2KI.10.24	They came to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed for himself eighty men outside, and he said, “The man who lets anyone escape from the men who I am entrusting to you,
2KI.10.25	It happened that when he finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the royal guard and to the officers, “Come and kill them; let no man go free!” So they put them to the sword,
2KI.10.26	They brought out the stone pillars of the temple of Baal and burned them.
2KI.10.27	So they broke down the stone pillars of Baal and destroyed the temple of Baal and made it into a latrine until this day. 
2KI.10.28	So Jehu wiped out Baal from Israel. 
2KI.10.29	Only Jehu did not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat by which he caused Israel to sin; namely, the calf-shaped idols of gold which were in Bethel and Dan. 
2KI.10.30	Yahweh said to Jehu, “Because you have done well by doing right in my eyes and you have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart; therefore, sons of the fourth generation will sit for you on the throne of Israel.” 
2KI.10.31	But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of Yahweh God of Israel with all his heart; he did not turn from the sins of Jeroboam by which he caused Israel to sin. 
2KI.10.32	In those days, Yahweh began to reduce Israel, so Hazael defeated them in every territory of Israel, 
2KI.10.33	from the Jordan eastward: all of the land of Gilead, the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer which is on the Wadi Arnon and Gilead and Bashan. 
2KI.10.34	Now the remainder of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all of his powerful deeds, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.10.35	So Jehu slept with his ancestors,
2KI.10.36	Now the days which Jehu had reigned over Israel were twenty-eight years in Samaria. 
2KI.11.1	Now Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, so she prepared to destroy all of the offspring of the royal family. 
2KI.11.2	But Jehosheba the daughter of King Joram and sister of Ahaziah took Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, and she stole him from among the sons of the king who were being put to death, putting him and his nurse in the inner bedroom. So they hid him from the presence of Athaliah, and he was not killed. 
2KI.11.3	He remained with her in the temple of Yahweh, hidden for six years while Athaliah was reigning over the land. 
2KI.11.4	But in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and took the commanders of the hundreds of the Carites and the runners, and he brought them to himself to the temple of Yahweh. Then he made
2KI.11.5	He commanded them, saying, “This is the thing which you must do: one third of you who go off duty on the Sabbath,
2KI.11.6	and another third at the gate of Sur, and a third at the gate behind the runners, shall guard the post of the palace alternately. 
2KI.11.7	Two of the units among you, all who go on duty on the Sabbath,
2KI.11.8	You must surround the king all about, each with his weapon in his hand; whoever comes to the ranks must be killed. Be with the king wherever he goes.”
2KI.11.9	So the commanders of hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and each took his men who went off duty on the Sabbath
2KI.11.10	Then the priest gave to the commanders of the hundreds spears and small round shields which were King David’s, which were in the temple of Yahweh. 
2KI.11.11	So the royal runners stood, each with his weapons in his hand, from the side of the temple to the south up to the side of the temple on the north, around the altar and around the temple, about the king all around. 
2KI.11.12	Then he brought out the son of the king, put the crown on him with the testimony, and they made him king, anointed him, clapped their hands, and said, “Long live the king!” 
2KI.11.13	When Athaliah heard the sound of the runners of the people, she came to the people at the temple of Yahweh. 
2KI.11.14	She looked, and there was the king standing by the pillar according to the custom. The commanders and the trumpeters were by the king, and all of the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing on the trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes and she called, “Treason, treason!” 
2KI.11.15	Then Jehoiada the priest commanded the commanders of the hundreds, the appointed of the army, and he said to them, “Bring her out to the house of the ranks! The one coming after her should kill her with the sword,” for the priest had said, “Let her not be killed in the temple of Yahweh.” 
2KI.11.16	So they grabbed her
2KI.11.17	Then Jehoiada made
2KI.11.18	Then all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down, and its altars and its images they broke completely into pieces. Mattan the priest of Baal they killed in front of the altars. Then the priest put guards over the house of Yahweh. 
2KI.11.19	He took the commanders of the hundreds and the Carites and the runners and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the temple of Yahweh. And they marched by the way of the runner’s gate to the palace of the king, and he sat on the throne of the kings. 
2KI.11.20	All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city rested; for Athaliah had been killed with the sword in the palace of the king. 
2KI.11.21	 Jehoash was seven years old
2KI.12.1	In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash became king. He reigned in Jerusalem forty years, and the name of his mother was Zibiah from Beersheba. 
2KI.12.2	Jehoash did right in the eyes of Yahweh all of his days, because Jehoiada the priest instructed him. 
2KI.12.3	Only the high places were not removed; the people were still making sacrifices and offering incense on the high places. 
2KI.12.4	Jehoash said to the priests, “All of the money for the sacred things that is brought to the temple of Yahweh, the money taxed at its proper value for each person
2KI.12.5	let the priests take for themselves, each from his treasurers, and let them repair the breach of the temple for every place where damage is found.” 
2KI.12.6	It happened in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash that the priests had not repaired the damage in the temple. 
2KI.12.7	So King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the priests, and he said to them, “Why are you not repairing the damage in the temple? Now, you shall not take money from your treasurers for the damage in the temple. You must provide it.” 
2KI.12.8	So the priests agreed not to take money from the people and not to repair the damage to the temple. 
2KI.12.9	Then Jehoiada the priest took a certain chest and bored a hole in its lid, and he put it beside the altar to the right as a man enters into the temple of Yahweh; then the priests who were keepers of the threshold would put there all of the money brought into the temple. 
2KI.12.10	It happened that when they saw a great deal of money in the chest, the secretary of the king and the high priest would come up, put the money in bags, then count the money found in the temple of Yahweh. 
2KI.12.11	They placed the money, which was weighed out, into the hands of the workers who were appointed over the temple of Yahweh, and they paid it to the skilled craftsmen of wood and to the builders working on the temple of Yahweh 
2KI.12.12	and to the masons and the stonecutters, to buy timber and stones for hewing, in order to repair the damage of the temple of Yahweh, and for all who went to the temple to repair it. 
2KI.12.13	Only, for the temple of Yahweh, there were not any silver basins, snuffers, bowls for drinking wine, trumpets, or any vessel of gold or silver from the money being brought to the temple of Yahweh. 
2KI.12.14	For they gave that to all the workers, and they repaired the temple
2KI.12.15	They did not have to settle accounts with the men into whose hands they placed the money to give to the workers, for they were dealing honestly. 
2KI.12.16	The money of the guilt offering and the money of the sin offering was not brought into the temple
2KI.12.17	At that time, Hazael king of Aram went up and fought against Gath and captured it; then Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem. 
2KI.12.18	Jehoash king of Judah took all of the holy objects that Jehoshaphat, Joram, and Ahaziah his ancestors,
2KI.12.19	Now the remainder of the acts of Joash and all that he did, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.12.20	Then his servants arose and conspired and killed Joash in the house of the Millo as he was going down toward Silla. 
2KI.12.21	Jozabad
2KI.13.1	In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu became king over Israel in Samaria, reigning seventeen years. 
2KI.13.2	But he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and he went after the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat with which he had caused Israel to sin, and he did not depart from it. 
2KI.13.3	So the anger of Yahweh was kindled
2KI.13.4	Then Jehoahaz entreated Yahweh, and Yahweh listened to him, for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Aram oppressed them. 
2KI.13.5	Yahweh gave Israel a savior, and they went out from under the hand of Aram. So the Israelites
2KI.13.6	Yet they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam which he caused Israel to sin, but walked in it; and also, the pole of the Asherah worship was still standing in Samaria. 
2KI.13.7	For there was no army left over for Jehoahaz except for fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand infantry, for the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them as the dust at threshing. 
2KI.13.8	Now the remainder of the acts of Jehoahaz and all that he did and his powerful deeds, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.13.9	Then Jehoahaz slept with his ancestors
2KI.13.10	In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria, reigning sixteen years. 
2KI.13.11	He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh; he did not depart from all of the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat which he caused Israel to sin, but walked in it. 
2KI.13.12	The remainder of the acts of Joash
2KI.13.13	Then Joash slept with his ancestors,
2KI.13.14	Elisha became ill with the illness with which he would die, so Jehoash king of Israel went down to him and wept before him, and said, “My father, my father; the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!” 
2KI.13.15	Elisha said to him, “Take a bow and arrows,” so he took him a bow and arrows. 
2KI.13.16	He said to the king of Israel, “Lay your hand on the bow,”
2KI.13.17	Then he said, “Open the window to the east,” so he opened it. Elisha said, “Shoot,” and he shot. Then he said, “An arrow of victory for Yahweh, and an arrow of victory against Aram; you shall fight the Arameans in Aphek until finishing them.” 
2KI.13.18	Then he said, “Take the arrows,” so he took them. He said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground,” so he struck three times and stopped. 
2KI.13.19	Yet the man of God became angry against him and said, “For striking five or six times, then you would have defeated Aram until finishing them, but now you will defeat Aram only three times.” 
2KI.13.20	Elisha died and they buried him. Now the raiding parties of Moab came in the spring.
2KI.13.21	And it happened that they were burying a man; suddenly they saw the marauding band, so they threw the man in the grave of Elisha. As he went in, the man touched the bones of Elisha, and became alive and got up on his feet! 
2KI.13.22	Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. 
2KI.13.23	But Yahweh had mercy on them and showed compassion to them and turned to them because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He was not willing to destroy them nor cast them from his presence up to now. 
2KI.13.24	When Hazael king of Aram died, his son Ben-Hadad became king in his place. 
2KI.13.25	Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz returned and took the cities from the hand of Ben-Hadad the son of Hazael which he had taken from the hand of Jehoahaz his father in the war. Three times Jehoash defeated him and recovered the towns of Israel. 
2KI.14.1	In the second year of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Jehoash king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.14.2	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother was Jehoaddin from Jerusalem. 
2KI.14.3	He did right in the eyes of Yahweh, only not as David his ancestor;
2KI.14.4	Only the high places were not removed; the people were still sacrificing and offering incense on the high places. 
2KI.14.5	It happened that when the kingdom was firmly in his hand, he killed his servants who had killed his father the king. 
2KI.14.6	But the sons of the killers he did not kill, as it is written in the scroll of the law of Moses which Yahweh had commanded, saying, “Fathers should not be killed because of children, and children should not be killed because of fathers; but a man should die because of his own sin.” 
2KI.14.7	He also killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and he seized Sela in the battle, and he called its name Jokteel, until this day. 
2KI.14.8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu king of Israel, saying, “Come let us meet face-to-face.”
2KI.14.9	So Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah, saying, “The thornbush which is in Lebanon sent to the cedar which is in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife,’ but an animal of the field which is in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thornbush. 
2KI.14.10	You have indeed defeated Edom and your heart is lifted up; enjoy the honor and stay home. Why should you provoke trouble so that you fall and Judah with you?” 
2KI.14.11	But Amaziah would not listen, so Jehoash king of Israel went up and they met face-to-face, he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-Shemesh which belongs to Judah. 
2KI.14.12	Judah was defeated before Israel and they fled, each to this tent. 
2KI.14.13	Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-Shemesh. Then they came to Jerusalem, and he broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim up to the Corner Gate, four hundred cubits! 
2KI.14.14	He also took all of the gold and silver and all the vessels found in the temple of Yahweh and in the treasury rooms of the palace of the king, as well as the hostages;
2KI.14.15	Now the remainder of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his powerful deeds, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.14.16	Then Jehoash slept with his ancestors
2KI.14.17	Amaziah the son of Jehoash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz king of Israel. 
2KI.14.18	The remainder of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.14.19	They conspired against him in Jerusalem, so he fled to Lachish. But they sent men after him to Lachish, and they killed him there. 
2KI.14.20	Then they carried him on the horses, and he was buried with his ancestors
2KI.14.21	All of the people of Judah took sixteen-year-old Azariah and made him king in place of this father Amaziah. 
2KI.14.22	He rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his ancestors.
2KI.14.23	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Jehoash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Jehoash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, reigning forty-one years. 
2KI.14.24	But he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat which he caused Israel to sin. 
2KI.14.25	He restored the boundary of Israel from Lebo-Hamath up to the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah the son of Amittai the prophet, who was from Gath-Hepher. 
2KI.14.26	For Yahweh saw that the misery of Israel was very bitter, whether bond or free, but there was no helper for Israel. 
2KI.14.27	Yahweh did not decree to blot out the name of Israel from under the heavens, so he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Jehoash. 
2KI.14.28	Now the remainder of the acts of Jeroboam, all that he did, his powerful deeds, how he fought, and how he restored Damascus and Hamath of Judah to Israel, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.14.29	So Jeroboam slept with his ancestors
2KI.15.1	In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah the son of Amaziah king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.15.2	He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 
2KI.15.3	He did right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that Amaziah his father had done. 
2KI.15.4	Only he did not remove the high places; the people were still sacrificing and burning incense on the high places. 
2KI.15.5	Yahweh struck the king, and he was infected with a skin disease until the day of his death. He lived in a separate house, while Jotham the son of the king was over the house, governing the people of the land. 
2KI.15.6	The remainder of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.15.7	So Azariah slept with his ancestors,
2KI.15.8	In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria for six months. 
2KI.15.9	He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh as his ancestors
2KI.15.10	Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, struck him in front of the people, killed him, and reigned in his place. 
2KI.15.11	Now the remainder of the acts of Zechariah, look, they are written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.12	This is the word of Yahweh which he spoke to Jehu, saying, “Sons of a fourth generation shall sit for you on the throne of Israel,” and it was so. 
2KI.15.13	Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned a full month
2KI.15.14	Then Menahem the son of Gadi came up from Tirzah, and he came to Samaria and struck down Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria and killed him. Then he became king in place of him. 
2KI.15.15	Now the remainder of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he conspired; look, they are written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.16	At that time Menahem destroyed Tiphsah, all who were in it, and all its territory from Tirzah, because it had not opened to him, so he destroyed it and ripped open all of its pregnant women. 
2KI.15.17	In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi began to reign over Israel for ten years in Samaria. 
2KI.15.18	But he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. He did not depart all of his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat which he caused Israel to sin. 
2KI.15.19	Pul the king of Assyria came against the land, so Menahem gave a thousand talents of silver to Pul so that his hand would be with him to strengthen his hold on the kingdom.
2KI.15.20	Menahem exacted the money from Israel, from all the very rich,
2KI.15.21	Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.15.22	So Menahem slept with his ancestors,
2KI.15.23	In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria for two years. 
2KI.15.24	But he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat which he caused Israel to sin. 
2KI.15.25	Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him, so he attacked him in Samaria in the citadel fortress of the palace of the king, with Argob and Arieh. With him also were fifty men from the children of the Gileadites, and he killed him and became king in his place. 
2KI.15.26	Now the remainder of the acts of Pekahiah and all that he did, look, they are written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.27	In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria for twenty years. 
2KI.15.28	He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat which he caused Israel to sin. 
2KI.15.29	In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser the king of Assyria came and took Ijon, Abel-Beth-Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, the Gilead, the Galilee, and all the land of Naphtali; then he deported them to Assyria. 
2KI.15.30	Hoshea the son of Elah conspired against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and he attacked and killed him. He reigned in place of him in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. 
2KI.15.31	Now the remainder of the acts of Pekah and all that he did, look, they are written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.32	In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.15.33	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok. 
2KI.15.34	He did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that Uzziah his father had done. 
2KI.15.35	Only the high places were not removed; the people still were sacrificing and offering incense on the high places. He built the upper gate of the temple of Yahweh. 
2KI.15.36	Now the remainder of the acts of Jotham which he did, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.15.37	(Now, in those days, Yahweh began to send Rezin the king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah.) 
2KI.15.38	So Jotham slept with his ancestors
2KI.16.1	In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.16.2	Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do right in the eyes of Yahweh his God as David his ancestor.
2KI.16.3	He walked in the way of the kings of Israel; he even let his son pass through the fire according to the detestable things of the nations which Yahweh drove out from before the Israelites.
2KI.16.4	He sacrificed and offered incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree. 
2KI.16.5	Then Rezin the king of Aram went up with Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel against Jerusalem for battle, and they besieged Ahaz but were not able to defeat
2KI.16.6	At that time, Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram and drove out the Judeans from Elath. The Arameans came to Elath and have lived there until this day. 
2KI.16.7	Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and rescue me from the hand of the king of Aram and from the hand of the king of Israel who are rising up against me.” 
2KI.16.8	Ahaz took the silver and gold found in the house of Yahweh and in the treasury rooms of the palace of the king, and he sent a gift to the king of Assyria. 
2KI.16.9	So the king of Assyria listened to him and he went up to Damascus and captured it and deported them to Kir. He also killed Rezin. 
2KI.16.10	So King Ahaz went to meet Tiglath-Pileser the king of Assyria in Damascus, and he saw the altar which was in Damascus, so King Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest the builder’s plan of the altar and the exact model of how it had been made.
2KI.16.11	So Uriah the priest built the altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus; thus Uriah the priest did before King Ahaz came from Damascus. 
2KI.16.12	When the king came from Damascus, the king saw the altar, so he went near to the altar and went up on it. 
2KI.16.13	Then he offered his burnt offerings and his grain offerings, he poured his libations and dashed the blood of his fellowship offerings against the altar. 
2KI.16.14	Now the bronze altar which was before Yahweh, he brought over from the front of the temple, from between his altar and the temple of Yahweh, and he placed it at the side of his altar to the north. 
2KI.16.15	Then King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, saying, “On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the grain offering of the evening, the burnt offering of the king and his grain offering, the burnt offering of all of the people of the land, their offerings, their libations, and all of the blood of the burnt offerings, the blood of the sacrifices you must dash on it. But the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.” 
2KI.16.16	So Uriah the priest did according to all that King Ahaz commanded. 
2KI.16.17	Then King Ahaz cut off the side panels of the water carts and removed from upon them the basin, and the sea he took down from the bronze oxen that were under it and put it on a stone base. 
2KI.16.18	The covering for the Sabbath which they had built in the palace and in the entrance of the king to the outside, he removed from the temple of Yahweh because of the presence of the king of Assyria. 
2KI.16.19	Now the remainder of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.16.20	So Ahaz slept with his ancestors
2KI.17.1	In the twelfth year of Ahaz the king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, reigning nine years. 
2KI.17.2	He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, only not as the kings of Israel who were before him. 
2KI.17.3	Shalmaneser the king of Assyria
2KI.17.4	But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea, for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and he did not offer tribute to the king of Assyria as he had year after year; so the king of Assyria arrested him, and confined him in a house of imprisonment. 
2KI.17.5	So the king of Assyria went up in all the land, then he went up to Samaria and besieged it for three years. 
2KI.17.6	In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported Israel to Assyria. He placed them in Halah, in Habor, in the river regions of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. 
2KI.17.7	Now this happened because the Israelites
2KI.17.8	They walked in the statutes of the nations whom Yahweh had driven out from before the Israelites,
2KI.17.9	The Israelites
2KI.17.10	They set up for themselves stone pillars and poles of Asherah worship on every high hill and under every green tree. 
2KI.17.11	They burned incense there on all the high places, like the nations which Yahweh deported before them, and they did evil things to provoke Yahweh. 
2KI.17.12	They served idols which Yahweh had said to them, “You shall not do this thing!” 
2KI.17.13	Yahweh warned Israel and Judah by the hand of his every prophet, with every seer saying, “Turn from all of your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my ordinances, according to all the law which I commanded your ancestors,
2KI.17.14	But they did not listen and they stiffened their necks, like the necks of their ancestors
2KI.17.15	They rejected his statutes, his covenant which he made
2KI.17.16	They abandoned all the commands of Yahweh their God and made for themselves two molten calf-shaped idols; they made a pole of Asherah worship and bowed down to the army of the heavens and served Baal. 
2KI.17.17	They made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire, they practiced divination and read omens, and they sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of Yahweh to provoke him. 
2KI.17.18	So Yahweh was very angry with Israel and he removed them from his presence; none remained except the tribe of Judah alone. 
2KI.17.19	Even Judah did not keep the commands of Yahweh their God, and they walked in the customs of Israel which they introduced, 
2KI.17.20	so Yahweh rejected all the offspring of Israel and punished them, and he gave them into the hand of the plunderers until he banished them from his presence. 
2KI.17.21	For he had torn Israel from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king, but Jeroboam detached Israel from following Yahweh, and he made them sin a great sin. 
2KI.17.22	The Israelites
2KI.17.23	until Yahweh removed Israel from his presence as he had foretold by the hand of all his servants, the prophets. And so he deported Israel from upon his land to Assyria until this day. 
2KI.17.24	The king of Assyria brought from Babylonia, from Cush, from Arva, from Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and he settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the Israelites,
2KI.17.25	It happened that when they began living there, they did not fear Yahweh, so Yahweh sent lions among them, and they were killing them.
2KI.17.26	So they said to the king of Assyria, “The nations whom you deported and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the customs of the God of the land, so he sent lions among them, and now they are killing them because they do not know the customs of the God of the land.” 
2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Release one of the priests whom you deported from there, and let him go and settle there. Let him teach them the customs of the God of the land.” 
2KI.17.28	So one of the priests went, whom they had deported from Samaria, and he settled in Bethel and was teaching them how they should fear Yahweh. 
2KI.17.29	Yet every nation was making their
2KI.17.30	The men of Babylonia made Succoth Benoth; the men of Cush made Nergal; the men of Hamath made Ashima. 
2KI.17.31	The Arvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; the Sepharvites were burning their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim. 
2KI.17.32	Those who were fearing Yahweh made priests of the high places from among themselves,
2KI.17.33	Yahweh they were fearing, but their gods they were serving, according to the customs of the nations from which they were deported. 
2KI.17.34	Until this day they are doing according to their former customs; none of them are fearing Yahweh, and none of them are doing according to their statutes, to their decisions, to the law, or to the commands that Yahweh commanded the descendants
2KI.17.35	Yahweh had made
2KI.17.36	Rather, Yahweh, who brought you out from the land of Egypt with great strength and with an outstretched arm—him you shall fear, and to him you shall bow down, and to him you shall sacrifice. 
2KI.17.37	The statutes, the decisions, the law, and the commands that he wrote to you, you shall observe to do always, and you shall not fear other gods. 
2KI.17.38	The covenant that I have made
2KI.17.39	But Yahweh your God you shall fear, and he will deliver you from the hand of all of your enemies.” 
2KI.17.40	They did not listen but kept on doing according to their former customs. 
2KI.17.41	So these nations were fearing Yahweh, but they were serving their idols, as were their children and their children’s children; as their ancestors
2KI.18.1	It happened in the third year of Hoshea the son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah became king. 
2KI.18.2	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah. 
2KI.18.3	He did right in the eyes of Yahweh according to all that David his ancestor
2KI.18.4	He removed the high places, and he smashed the stone pillars; he cut down the poles of Asherah worship and demolished the bronze serpent which Moses had made, for up to those days the Israelites
2KI.18.5	He trusted in Yahweh the God of Israel; there was no one like him, before or after, among all the kings of Judah. 
2KI.18.6	He held on to Yahweh; he did not depart from following him, and he kept his commands that Yahweh had commanded Moses. 
2KI.18.7	Yahweh was with him; everywhere he went, he succeeded. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him. 
2KI.18.8	He attacked the Philistines up to Gaza and its territory from the watchtower up to the fortified city. 
2KI.18.9	It happened in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, that is, the seventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came against Samaria and laid siege against her. 
2KI.18.10	At the end of three years, he captured it in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is, the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel; Samaria was captured. 
2KI.18.11	Then the king of Assyria deported Israel to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Habor, in the river regions of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes, 
2KI.18.12	because they did not listen to the voice of Yahweh their God, and they transgressed his covenant; all that he had commanded Moses, the servant of Yahweh, they did not listen to nor did they obey. 
2KI.18.13	In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all of the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. 
2KI.18.14	So Hezekiah king of Judah sent word to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have done wrong. Withdraw from me. What you impose on me I will bear.” So the king of Assyria imposed on Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. 
2KI.18.15	Then Hezekiah gave all of the silver found in the temple of Yahweh and in the storerooms of the house of the king. 
2KI.18.16	At that time, Hezekiah cut off the doors of the temple of Yahweh and the doorposts which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and he gave them to the king of Assyria. 
2KI.18.17	So the king of Assyria sent the commander in chief, the chief eunuch, and the chief advisor
2KI.18.18	Then they called to the king, so Eliakim the son of Hilkiah who was over the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came out to them. 
2KI.18.19	Then the chief advisor said to them, “Please say to Hezekiah: ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: “What is this confidence that you trust? 
2KI.18.20	You think only a word of lips, ‘I have advice and power for the war.’ Now, on whom do you trust that you have rebelled against me? 
2KI.18.21	Now, look! You rely
2KI.18.22	But if you say to me, ‘On Yahweh our God we trust,’ is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, and he had said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘In the presence of this altar you shall bow down only in Jerusalem?’ 
2KI.18.23	So then, please make a wager with my lord, with the king of Assyria, and I will give to you a thousand horses if you are able on your part to put riders on them.
2KI.18.24	How can you repulse a single captain among the least of the servants of my master
2KI.18.25	Have I now come up against this place without Yahweh to destroy it? Yahweh has said to me, ‘Go up against this land and destroy it!’ ” ’ ” 
2KI.18.26	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah and Shebna and Joah said to the chief commander, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we are understanding, but you must not speak Judean with us in the ears of the people who are on the wall.” 
2KI.18.27	The chief commander said to them, “Is it solely to your master and to you my master has sent me to speak these words? Is it not for the men who sit on the wall to eat their feces and to drink their urine with you?” 
2KI.18.28	Then the chief commander stood and called with a great voice in Judean, and he spoke and said, “Hear the word of the king, the great king of Assyria! 
2KI.18.29	Thus says the king, ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to rescue you from my
2KI.18.30	Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, “Certainly Yahweh will rescue us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria!” ’ 
2KI.18.31	Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria, ‘Make with me a treaty of peace and come out to me that each may eat from his vine and each from his fig tree, and each may drink water from his cistern! 
2KI.18.32	Until I come and take you to a land like your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees, olive oil, and honey, that you may live and not die! You must not listen to Hezekiah, for he has misled you by saying, “Yahweh will deliver us!” 
2KI.18.33	Did the gods of each of the nations ever rescue the land from the hand of the king of Assyria? 
2KI.18.34	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? For did they rescue Samaria from my hand? 
2KI.18.35	Who among all of the gods of the countries have rescued their countries from my hand that Yahweh should rescue Jerusalem from my hand?’ ” 
2KI.18.36	The people were silent, and they did not answer him a word, for the command of that king was saying, “You shall not answer him.” 
2KI.18.37	Eliakim the son of Hilkiah who was over the palace, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with torn clothes, and they told him the words of the chief commander. 
2KI.19.1	It happened that when King Hezekiah heard, he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went to the temple of Yahweh. 
2KI.19.2	He sent Eliakim who was over the palace, Shebna the secretary, the elders, and the priests, all clothed in sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 
2KI.19.3	They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘A day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace is this day, for the children are about to be born,
2KI.19.4	Perhaps Yahweh your God will hear all of the words of the chief commander whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to insult the living God, and he will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remainder who are left.’ ” 
2KI.19.5	So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, 
2KI.19.6	and Isaiah said to them, “Thus you must say to your master, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “You must not be afraid because the face of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have reviled me. 
2KI.19.7	Look, I am putting in him a spirit. He will hear a rumor and return to his land. Then I will cause him to fall by the sword in his land.” ’ ” 
2KI.19.8	When the chief commander returned, he found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish. 
2KI.19.9	He heard about Tirhakah, the king of Cush, saying, “Look, he has set out to fight with you,” so he again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
2KI.19.10	“Thus you shall say to Hezekiah the king of Judah, ‘Let not your God whom you are trusting deceive you, by his saying, “Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria!” 
2KI.19.11	Look, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, by utterly destroying them, and shall you be delivered? 
2KI.19.12	Did the gods of the nations that my predecessors
2KI.19.13	Where are the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’ ” 
2KI.19.14	Hezekiah took the letters from the hand of the messengers and read them. Then he went up to the temple of Yahweh, and Hezekiah spread them out before the presence of Yahweh. 
2KI.19.15	Then Hezekiah prayed before the face of Yahweh and said, “O Yahweh, God of Israel who lives above the cherubim. You are God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the world; you have made the heavens and the earth. 
2KI.19.16	Incline your ears and hear; open, O Yahweh, your eyes and see and hear the words of Sennacherib which he has sent to insult the living God. 
2KI.19.17	Truly, O Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have utterly destroyed the nations and their land. 
2KI.19.18	He has hurled their gods in the fire because they are not gods, but the work of the hands of a human made of wood and stone, so they destroyed them. 
2KI.19.19	So then, O Yahweh our God, rescue us, please, from his hand, that all of the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Yahweh, you alone are God!” 
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, ‘What you have prayed to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard. 
2KI.19.21	This is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him: 
2KI.19.21	She despises you, she scorns you, 
2KI.19.21	the virgin daughter of Zion. 
2KI.19.21	Behind you the daughter of Jerusalem 
2KI.19.21	shakes her head. 
2KI.19.22	Whom have you mocked and reviled? 
2KI.19.22	And against whom have you have raised your voice 
2KI.19.22	and have haughtily lifted your eyes? 
2KI.19.22	Against the Holy One of Israel! 
2KI.19.23	By the hand of your messengers you have mocked the Lord, 
2KI.19.23	and you have said, 
2KI.19.23	‘With my many chariots I have gone up 
2KI.19.23	to the height of the mountains. 
2KI.19.23	To the remote areas of Lebanon, 
2KI.19.23	I have felled the tallest of its cedars, 
2KI.19.23	the choicest of its cypresses. 
2KI.19.23	I have entered the place of overnight lodging. 
2KI.19.23	Even to the edge of forest of its fertile land. 
2KI.19.24	I dug wells and I drank foreign water, 
2KI.19.24	and I dried up with the sole of my steps 
2KI.19.24	all the canals of Egypt.’ 
2KI.19.25	Have you not heard? 
2KI.19.25	From long ago I have determined it, 
2KI.19.25	from the days of old I have planned it, 
2KI.19.25	and now I am bringing it to pass. 
2KI.19.25	It shall be turned into a pile of rocks; 
2KI.19.25	fortified cities are ruined. 
2KI.19.26	Their inhabitants, short of hand, shall be dismayed; 
2KI.19.26	and they shall be ashamed. 
2KI.19.26	They have become green plants of the open field, 
2KI.19.26	and tender grass, 
2KI.19.26	green grass of the roof 
2KI.19.26	and blight before the standing grain. 
2KI.19.27	Your sitting, your going out, and your coming in I know, 
2KI.19.27	and your raging against me. 
2KI.19.28	Because you are raging against me, 
2KI.19.28	and your arrogance has come up in my ears, 
2KI.19.28	I will put my nose ring in your nose 
2KI.19.28	and my bridle in your mouth. 
2KI.19.28	And I will turn you back 
2KI.19.28	on the way that you have come. 
2KI.19.29	“ ‘This will be the sign for you: Eat the volunteer plants for the year, and in the second year, the volunteer plants that spring up from that. But in the third year, sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 
2KI.19.30	The remainder of the house of Judah which survives will again take root below and bear fruit above. 
2KI.19.31	For from Jerusalem a remnant shall go out and survivors from Mount Zion; the zeal of Yahweh will do this. 
2KI.19.32	“ ‘Therefore thus says Yahweh to the king of Assyria, “He shall not come to this city, nor shall he shoot an arrow there, nor shall he bring a small shield near her, nor shall he cast a siege ramp against her. 
2KI.19.33	By the way that he came to her he shall return; but to this city, he shall not come,” declares Yahweh. 
2KI.19.34	And I will defend this city to save her for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.’ ” 
2KI.19.35	It happened in that night that an angel of Yahweh went out, and he struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of Assyria. When they got up early in the morning, look! All of them were dead corpses. 
2KI.19.36	Then Sennacherib king of Assyria set out and went and returned and lived in Nineveh. 
2KI.19.37	It happened that he was worshiping in the temple of Nisroch his god, and Adrammelech and Sharezer
2KI.20.1	In those days Hezekiah became deathly ill,
2KI.20.2	Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh, saying, 
2KI.20.3	“O Yahweh, please remember how I went about before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and remember the good that I have done in your eyes.” Then Hezekiah wept bitterly.
2KI.20.4	Isaiah had not gone out from the middle of the city when the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, 
2KI.20.5	“Return; you must say to Hezekiah, the leader of my people, ‘Thus says Yahweh the God of David your ancestor,
2KI.20.6	I will add to your days fifteen years, and from the hand of the king of Assyria I will deliver you and this city. I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.” ’ ” 
2KI.20.7	Then Isaiah said, “Bring a lump of figs,” so they took and put it on the skin sores, and he lived. 
2KI.20.8	Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What is the sign that Yahweh will heal me that I shall go up on the third day to the temple of Yahweh?” 
2KI.20.9	Isaiah said, “This is the sign for you from Yahweh that Yahweh will do the thing that he has promised: Shall the shadow advance ten steps or shall it return ten steps?” 
2KI.20.10	Hezekiah answered, “It is easy for the shadow to lengthen ten steps. No, but let the shadow return backwards ten steps.” 
2KI.20.11	Isaiah the prophet called to Yahweh, and he brought back the shadow on the steps where it had gone down on the steps of Ahaz, backwards ten steps. 
2KI.20.12	At that time, Berodak-Baladan the son of Baladan king of Babylon
2KI.20.13	Hezekiah heard about them and showed them all of the house of his treasure, both the silver and the gold, the spices, the good olive oil, the room of his weapons, and all that could be found in his treasuries. There was nothing that he did not show them in his palace and in all of his kingdom. 
2KI.20.14	Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where have they come to you?” Hezekiah said, “From a far land; they have come from Babylon.” 
2KI.20.15	Then he asked, “What did they see in your palace?” And Hezekiah said, “All that is in my palace they have seen; there is nothing that I did not show them in my treasuries.” 
2KI.20.16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of Yahweh! 
2KI.20.17	‘Look, days are coming when all that is in your palace will be carried off; even all that your ancestors
2KI.20.18	‘Your sons who went out from you, whom you brought forth, will be taken, and they shall be eunuchs in the temple of the king of Babylon.’ ” 
2KI.20.19	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of Yahweh which you have spoken is good,” and he thought, “Is it not that peace and security shall be in my days?” 
2KI.20.20	Now the remainder of the acts of Hezekiah, all of his powerful deeds, and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought the water into the city, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.20.21	Then Hezekiah slept with his ancestors,
2KI.21.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hephzibah. 
2KI.21.2	He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, according to the detestable things of the nations that Yahweh had driven out from the presence of the Israelites.
2KI.21.3	He returned and rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed. He erected altars for Baal and made a pole of Asherah worship just as Ahab king of Israel had made, and he bowed down to all of the host of heaven and served them. 
2KI.21.4	He built altars in the temple of Yahweh about which Yahweh had said, “I will put my name in Jerusalem.” 
2KI.21.5	He built an altar to all of the host of heaven in the two courtyards of the temple of Yahweh. 
2KI.21.6	He made his son pass through the fire, practiced soothsaying and divination, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He increased the doing of evil in the eyes of Yahweh to provoke him. 
2KI.21.7	He put the image of the Asherah that he had made in the temple which Yahweh had said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this temple and in Jerusalem which I have chosen from all of the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever. 
2KI.21.8	I will not again make the feet of Israel wander from the land which I have given to their ancestors,
2KI.21.9	But Manasseh did not listen and tempted them to do evil more than the nations that Yahweh destroyed before the presence of the Israelites.
2KI.21.10	So Yahweh spoke by the hand of his servants the prophets, saying, 
2KI.21.11	“Because Manasseh the king of Judah committed these detestable things and did evil more than the Amorites did who were before him and caused even Judah to sin with his idols, 
2KI.21.12	therefore, thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, ‘Look, I am bringing disaster upon Jerusalem and Judah about which the two ears of all who hear it will tingle. 
2KI.21.13	I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plumb line of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes the dish; he wipes it and turns it on its face. 
2KI.21.14	I will give up the remainder of my inheritance, and I will give them into the hand of their enemies. They shall become as prey and as spoil for all their enemies, 
2KI.21.15	because they have done evil in my eyes and were provoking me from the day that their ancestors
2KI.21.16	Moreover, Manasseh shed very much innocent blood until he filled Jerusalem from one end to another,
2KI.21.17	The remainder of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did and his sin that he committed, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.18	Then Manasseh slept with his ancestors
2KI.21.19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz from Jotbah. 
2KI.21.20	He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh as Manasseh his father had done. 
2KI.21.21	He walked in all of the way which his father had walked, and he served the idols which his father had served and bowed down to them. 
2KI.21.22	He abandoned Yahweh the God of his ancestors
2KI.21.23	The servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his palace. 
2KI.21.24	But the people of the land killed all who conspired against the king and made Josiah his son king in his place. 
2KI.21.25	The remainder of the acts of Amon that he did, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.26	They buried him in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son became king in place of him. 
2KI.22.1	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah from Bozkath. 
2KI.22.2	He did right in the eyes of Yahweh, and he walked in all of the way of David his ancestor
2KI.22.3	It happened in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent word to Shaphan the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the secretary of the temple of Yahweh, saying, 
2KI.22.4	“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, and let them count the money being brought to the temple of Yahweh which the keepers of the threshold have collected from the people, 
2KI.22.5	and let them give it into the hand of those appointed doers of the work at the temple of Yahweh. Let them give it to the doers of the work who are at the temple of Yahweh to repair the breach of the temple: 
2KI.22.6	to the skilled craftsmen, to the builders, to the masons, and to buy timber and hewing stones to repair the temple. 
2KI.22.7	Only the money being given to them is not to be accounted for by them, for they are dealing with honesty.” 
2KI.22.8	Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the scroll of the Torah in the temple of Yahweh,” and Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan and he read it. 
2KI.22.9	Shaphan the secretary came to the king and returned the king a word, and he said, “Your servant poured out the money found in the temple, and they have given it into the hand of the doers of the work appointed over the temple of Yahweh.” 
2KI.22.10	Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king saying, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll.” Then Shaphan read before the king. 
2KI.22.11	When the king heard the words of the scroll of the Torah, he tore his clothes. 
2KI.22.12	Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Acbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the servant of the king, saying, 
2KI.22.13	“Go, inquire of Yahweh for me and for the people and for all of Judah concerning the words of this scroll that was found. For the wrath of Yahweh that is kindled against us is great because our ancestors
2KI.22.14	So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Acbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah the son of Harhas, the keeper of the robes. Now she was living in Jerusalem in the second district. Then they spoke to her, 
2KI.22.15	and she said to them, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, ‘Say to the man who sent you to me, 
2KI.22.16	“Thus says Yahweh, ‘Look I am bringing evil to this place and upon its inhabitants, according to all of the words of that scroll that the king of Judah has read 
2KI.22.17	because they have abandoned me and they have burned incense to other gods, provoking me to anger with all of the works of their hands. My wrath shall be kindled against this place and not be quenched.’ ” 
2KI.22.18	And to the king of Judah who sent all of you to inquire of Yahweh, thus you shall say to him, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, ‘Concerning the words that you have heard, 
2KI.22.19	because you have a responsive heart, and you humbled yourself before Yahweh when you heard how I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants to become a desolation and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before my face, I have also heard, declares Yahweh. 
2KI.22.20	Therefore look, I am gathering you to your ancestors,
2KI.23.1	So the king sent word, and all of the elders of Judah and Jerusalem gathered to him. 
2KI.23.2	Then the king went up to the temple of Yahweh, and all of the men of Judah and all of the inhabitants of Jerusalem were with him, including the priests, the prophets, and all of the people from smallest to greatest; and in their hearing
2KI.23.3	Then the king stood by the pillar, and he made
2KI.23.4	Then the king
2KI.23.5	He removed the priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense on the high places at the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem and who offered incense to, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven. 
2KI.23.6	He brought out the Asherah image from the temple of Yahweh outside of Jerusalem to the Wadi of the Kidron and burnt it there;
2KI.23.7	He tore down the shrines of the male shrine prostitutes which were in the temple of Yahweh, where the women were weaving shrines for the Asherah. 
2KI.23.8	Then he brought all of the priests from the cities of Judah and defiled the high places where the priests from Geba up to Beersheba burned incense. He tore down the high places of the gates which were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, which were on the left of each gate of the city. 
2KI.23.9	However, the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread in the midst of their relatives. 
2KI.23.10	He defiled the Topheth which is in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, to prevent
2KI.23.11	He kept the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun from coming to the temple of Yawheh at the side room of Nathan-Melech the eunuch, which was in the court; and the chariots of the sun he burned with fire. 
2KI.23.12	The altars which were on the roof of the upper room of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courtyards of the temple of Yahweh, the king tore down and ran from there and threw their ashes into the Wadi Kidron. 
2KI.23.13	The high places which were east of Jerusalem, which were on the south of the Mountain of Destruction which Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab and for Molech the detestable thing of the Ammonites,
2KI.23.14	He also broke into pieces the stone pillars and cut down the Asherah poles and covered their sites with human bones. 
2KI.23.15	Moreover, the altar which was in Bethel, the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin, had built, even that altar and the high place, Josiah tore down. Then he burned down the high place and crushed the pole of Asherah worship to dust and burned it with fire. 
2KI.23.16	When Josiah turned and saw the tombs which were there on the hill, he sent and took the bones from the tombs and burned them on the altar. Thus he defiled them according to the word of Yahweh that the man of God had proclaimed who had proclaimed these things. 
2KI.23.17	Then he said, “What is this gravestone that I am seeing?” The men of the city said to him, “This is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which you have done against the altar of Bethel.” 
2KI.23.18	So Josiah said, “Let him rest and let no man move his bones.” So they left his bones undisturbed with the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria. 
2KI.23.19	Moreover, all of the shrines of the high places which were in the towns of Samaria which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Yahweh, Josiah removed, and he did to them like all of the deeds he had done in Bethel. 
2KI.23.20	Then he slaughtered all of the priests of the high places who were there, on the altars, and he burned the bones of the humans on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem. 
2KI.23.21	Then the king commanded all of the people, saying, “Keep the Passover to Yahweh your God, as has been written on the scroll of this covenant.” 
2KI.23.22	For they had not kept this Passover from the days of the judges who had judged over Israel or
2KI.23.23	But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was kept for Yahweh in Jerusalem. 
2KI.23.24	Moreover, the mediums and the spiritists, the household gods and the idols, and all of the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, Josiah removed in order to establish the words of the law written on the scroll that Hilkiah the priest had found in the temple of Yahweh. 
2KI.23.25	There was not a king like him before him, who turned to Yahweh with all of his heart and with all of his soul and with all of his might according to the law
2KI.23.26	However, Yahweh did not turn from the fierceness of his great anger which was kindled against Judah because of all of the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him. 
2KI.23.27	Yahweh had said, “Even Judah I will remove from my face, as I have removed Israel; I will reject this city that I have chosen, even Jerusalem and the house of which I said, ‘My name shall be there’!” 
2KI.23.28	The remainder of the acts of Josiah and all that he did, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.23.29	In his days, Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, went up against the king of Assyria at the Euphrates River. King Josiah went to meet him, and he
2KI.23.30	So his servants drove him dead in a chariot from Megiddo, and they brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father. 
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 
2KI.23.32	He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh according to all his ancestors
2KI.23.33	Then Pharaoh Neco confined him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, from reigning in Jerusalem, and imposed a levy on the land of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
2KI.23.34	Then Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in place of Josiah his father, and he changed his name to Jehoiakim. Then he took Jehoahaz and brought him to Egypt, and he died there. 
2KI.23.35	The silver and the gold Jehoiakim gave to Pharaoh; however, he taxed the land to give the silver to meet the demands of Pharaoh.
2KI.23.36	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Zebudah,
2KI.23.37	He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh according to all that his ancestors
2KI.24.1	In his days, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up because Jehoiakim had become his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him. 
2KI.24.2	So Yahweh sent against him raiding bands of Chaldeans, raiding bands of Aram, raiding bands of Moab, and raiding bands of the Ammonites.
2KI.24.3	Surely, it was on the command
2KI.24.4	Also, for the blood of the innocent that he had shed—and he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood—Yahweh was not willing to forgive. 
2KI.24.5	The remainder of the acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.24.6	So Jehoiakim slept with his ancestors,
2KI.24.7	The king of Egypt did not again come out from his land, for the king of Babylon had taken territory from the Wadi of Egypt to the Euphrates River. 
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan from Jerusalem. 
2KI.24.9	He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh according to all that his father had done. 
2KI.24.10	At that time, the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and the city came under the siege. 
2KI.24.11	Then Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city while his servants were besieging it. 
2KI.24.12	Jehoiachin king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, his mother, his servants, his commanders, and his court officials. The king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign. 
2KI.24.13	Then he took from there all of the treasures of the temple of Yahweh and the treasures of the palace of the king. He cut up all of the vessels of gold which Solomon the king of Israel had made in the temple of Yahweh, as Yahweh had foretold. 
2KI.24.14	He deported all of Jerusalem: all of the commanders, ten thousand of the skilled warriors, and the artisans; no one was left over except the poorest of the people of the land. 
2KI.24.15	He deported Jehoiachin to Babylon; the mother of the king, the wives of the king, his court officials, and the citizenry of the land he caused to go into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: 
2KI.24.16	of all of the skilled men, seven thousand, and of the skilled craftsmen and the artisans, one thousand. All of the mighty warriors fit for war
2KI.24.17	Then the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his uncle king in his place and changed his name to Zedekiah. 
2KI.24.18	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 
2KI.24.19	He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh just like all that Jehoiakim had done. 
2KI.24.20	For it happened because of the anger of Yahweh, in Jerusalem and in Judah, until they were cast out from his presence. Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
2KI.25.1	It happened that in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came, he and his army, against Jerusalem. He encamped against it and built siege works against it all around. 
2KI.25.2	So the city came under siege until the eleventh year of the king. 
2KI.25.3	In the ninth month, the famine became severe in the city, and there was no food for the people of the land. 
2KI.25.4	Then the city was breached, and all of the men of war entered by night by way of the gate between the wall which was by the garden of the king, and the Chaldeans were against the city all around, so he
2KI.25.5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the Arabah of Jericho, and all of his army scattered from him. 
2KI.25.6	So they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they passed sentence on him.
2KI.25.7	They slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; then they blinded the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon. 
2KI.25.8	In the fifth month, on the seventh of the month, that is, the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, a commander of the imperial guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. 
2KI.25.9	He burned the temple of Yahweh, the palace of the king, and all of the houses of Jerusalem; every large house he burned with fire. 
2KI.25.10	He and all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the imperial guard tore down the wall of Jerusalem all around. 
2KI.25.11	The remainder of the people left in the city, the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the remainder of the multitude, Nebuzaradan the commander of the imperial guard deported. 
2KI.25.12	But the poor of the land the commander of the imperial guard left for the vineyards and for tilling. 
2KI.25.13	The bronze pillars which were in the temple
2KI.25.14	The pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the dishes, and the vessels of bronze with which they served there, they took. 
2KI.25.15	The firepans and the basins, whatever was gold, the commander of the imperial guard took for the gold and whatever was silver, for the silver. 
2KI.25.16	The two pillars, the one sea, and the water cart which Solomon had made for the temple of Yahweh, there was no weighing to the bronze of all of these vessels. 
2KI.25.17	The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; a bronze capital was on it, with the height of the capital being three cubits. The latticework and pomegranates on the capital all around were bronze, and likewise on the latticework for the second pillar. 
2KI.25.18	Then the commander of the imperial guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and three of the threshold keepers. 
2KI.25.19	From the city he took one court official who was chief officer over the men of war, five men from the king’s council
2KI.25.20	Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
2KI.25.21	Then the king of Babylon struck them down and killed them at Riblah in the land of Hamath; thus Judah was removed from its land. 
2KI.25.22	Now as far as the people left in Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon left behind, he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan over them. 
2KI.25.23	When all of the commanders of the troops heard, they and the men, that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seriah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. 
2KI.25.24	Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and he said to them, “You must not be afraid because of the Chaldeans. Settle in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and may it go well with you.” 
2KI.25.25	But it happened in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama from the offspring of the kingship came, and ten men with him, and they struck down Gedaliah so that he died with the Judeans and with the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. 
2KI.25.26	Then all the people, from youngest to oldest, and the commanders of the troops, went to Egypt, for they were afraid of the presence of the Chaldeans. 
2KI.25.27	It happened in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month on the twenty-seventh of the month, lifted Evil-Merodach king of Babylon in the year that he became king, the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah from the house of imprisonment. 
2KI.25.28	He spoke kindly
2KI.25.29	So he changed the clothes of his imprisonment, and he ate food continually in his presence all the days of his life. 
2KI.25.30	His allowance was continually given to him from the king, a portion every day

1CH.9.29	And some of them were appointed over the objects, over the objects of the sanctuary, and over the wheat flour and the wine, the olive oil, the frankincense, and the spices. 
1CH.9.30	And some of the sons of the priests mixed the fragrant ointment for the spices. 
1CH.9.31	And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite and was entrusted
1CH.9.32	And from the sons of the Kohathites, some of their kinsmen were over the showbread
1CH.9.33	Now these were the singers; the heads of the families
1CH.9.34	These were the heads of the families
1CH.9.35	And these lived in Gibeon: Jeiel the father of Gibeon. And the name of his wife was Maacah. 
1CH.9.36	And his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, 
1CH.9.37	Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth. 
1CH.9.38	And Mikloth fathered Shimeam. And they also lived nearby their brothers in Jerusalem with their brothers. 
1CH.9.39	And Ner fathered Kish, and Kish fathered Saul, and Saul fathered Jonathan, Malchi-Shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal. 
1CH.9.40	And the son of Jonathan was Meribaal. And Meribaal fathered Micah. 
1CH.9.41	And the sons of Micah were Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz.
1CH.9.42	And Ahaz fathered Jarah, and Jarah fathered Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri. And Zimri fathered Moza, 
1CH.9.43	and Moza fathered Binea; and Rephaiah was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son. 
1CH.9.44	And Azel had six sons, and these are their names: Azrikam, Bokeru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These were the sons of Azel. 
1CH.10.1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and every Israelite fled away from before the Philistines. And they fell slain upon Mount Gilboa. 
1CH.10.2	And the Philistines overtook
1CH.10.3	And the battle was heavy against Saul, and the archers
1CH.10.4	And Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and deal harshly with me.” But he was very afraid. Then Saul took the sword and fell upon it. 
1CH.10.5	When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon the sword, and he died. 
1CH.10.6	So Saul died. And his three sons and all his house died together. 
1CH.10.7	And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they
1CH.10.8	And it happened that on the next day when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
1CH.10.9	And they stripped him and took his head and his weapons, and they sent them throughout the land of the Philistines to bring news to their idols and the nation. 
1CH.10.10	And they put his weapons in the temple of their gods, and they fastened his skull to the temple of Dagon. 
1CH.10.11	When all Jabesh-Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1CH.10.12	every strong man arose and took the dead body of Saul and the dead bodies of his sons and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days. 
1CH.10.13	So Saul died on account of his sin which he had sinned against Yahweh concerning the command of Yahweh that he did not keep. He also consulted a medium to seek guidance. 
1CH.10.14	But he did not seek Yahweh. So Yahweh put him to death and turned over the kingship to David, the son of Jesse. 
1CH.11.1	Then all Israel gathered to David in Hebron, saying, “Look—we are your flesh and bones. 
1CH.11.2	For some time now,
1CH.11.3	Then all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron in the presence of Yahweh. And they anointed David as king over Israel according to the word of Yahweh by the hand of Samuel. 
1CH.11.4	And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is Jebus). And the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there. 
1CH.11.5	And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not enter here.” But David captured the stronghold of Zion; that is, the city of David. 
1CH.11.6	Then David said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first will be chief and commander.” And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first and became chief. 
1CH.11.7	And David lived in the fortress. Therefore they called it the city of David. 
1CH.11.8	And he built the city all around from the Millo and up to the circuit. And Joab restored the remainder of the city. 
1CH.11.9	And David became greater and greater.
1CH.11.10	Now these are the chiefs of the mighty men who were for David, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel to make him king according to the word of Yahweh concerning Israel. 
1CH.11.11	And this is the numbering of the mighty warriors who were for David: Jashobeam son of Hachmoni was chief of the three. He himself raised his spear against three hundred whom he killed on one occasion. 
1CH.11.12	And after him was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite. He was among the three mighty warriors. 
1CH.11.13	He himself was with David at Pas-Dammim when the Philistines were gathered there for the battle. And there was a plot of the field filled with barley, and the people fled before the Philistines. 
1CH.11.14	But they took their stand in the middle of the plot and defended it. And they killed the Philistines. And Yahweh saved them with a great victory. 
1CH.11.15	And three of the thirty chiefs went down toward the rock to David at the cave of Adullam when the army of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.11.16	And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. 
1CH.11.17	And David had a craving, and he said, “Who could give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!” 
1CH.11.18	Then the three broke through into the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and brought it and came to David. But David would not drink it and poured it out before Yahweh. 
1CH.11.19	And he said, “Far be it from me that I would do this before my God. Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives
1CH.11.20	Now Abishai the brother of Joab was himself the head of the three.
1CH.11.21	He was twice as renowned
1CH.11.22	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a strong man
1CH.11.23	And he himself struck down an Egyptian man, a large man five cubits tall. And in the hand of the Egyptian was a spear like a weaver’s beam. But he went down to him with a club and seized the spear from the hand of the Egyptian and killed him with his own spear. 
1CH.11.24	These things Benaiah son of Jehoiada did and had a name among the three mighty warriors. 
1CH.11.25	He himself was certainly distinguished among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David appointed him over his bodyguard. 
1CH.11.26	Now the mighty warriors of the troops were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo from Bethlehem, 
1CH.11.27	Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 
1CH.11.28	Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, 
1CH.11.29	Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 
1CH.11.30	Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, 
1CH.11.31	Ittai the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the people of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 
1CH.11.32	Hurai of the valleys of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 
1CH.11.33	Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 
1CH.11.34	the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jehonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite, 
1CH.11.35	Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, 
1CH.11.36	Hepher the Mekerathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 
1CH.11.37	Hezro the Carmelite, Naari the son of Ezbai, 
1CH.11.38	Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, 
1CH.11.39	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the bearer of the weapons of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 
1CH.11.40	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
1CH.11.41	Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, 
1CH.11.42	Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a leader of the Reubenites, and thirty with him, 
1CH.11.43	Hanan the son of Maacah, Jehoshaphat the Mithnite, 
1CH.11.44	Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite, 
1CH.11.45	Jediael the son of Shimri and Joha his brother the Tizite, 
1CH.11.46	Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite, 
1CH.11.47	Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite. 
1CH.12.1	Now these are the ones who came to David at Ziklag while he was still shut up because of Saul,
1CH.12.2	They were armed with the bow, able to shoot right-handed or left-handed, slinging stones or shooting arrows with the bow; they were kinsmen of Saul from Benjamin. 
1CH.12.3	The leader was Ahiezer, then Jehoash, sons of Shemaah the Gibeonite; Jeiel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite; 
1CH.12.4	Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty warrior among the thirty who was over the thirty;
1CH.12.5	 Eluzai; Jerimoth; Bealiah; Shemariah; Shephatiah the Hariphite; 
1CH.12.6	Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam the Korahites; 
1CH.12.7	Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham from the Gedor. 
1CH.12.8	And from the Gadites, valiant mighty warriors, soldiers fit for war,
1CH.12.9	Ezer the chief, Obadiah second, Eliab third, 
1CH.12.10	Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth, 
1CH.12.11	Attai sixth, Eliel seventh, 
1CH.12.12	Jehonan eighth, Elzabad ninth, 
1CH.12.13	Jeremiah tenth, Macbannai eleventh. 
1CH.12.14	These were the sons of Gad, leaders of the army. The smallest one was as a hundred, and the greatest as a thousand. 
1CH.12.15	These were they who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it was filled over its banks. And they put to flight all who were in the valley to the east and to the west. 
1CH.12.16	And some of the sons of Benjamin and from Judah came to the fortress, to David. 
1CH.12.17	And David went out to meet them
1CH.12.18	Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the thirty who said: 
1CH.12.18	“We are yours, O David! 
1CH.12.18	And we are with you, O son of Jesse! 
1CH.12.18	Peace! Peace to you, and peace to those who help you, 
1CH.12.18	for your God helps you.” 
1CH.12.18	So David appointed them as heads of the troops. 
1CH.12.19	And some Manassites deserted to David when he came with the Philistines to the battle against Saul, but he did not help them, for the rulers of the Philistines sent him away upon counsel, saying, “He will desert to his master Saul at the cost of our heads.” 
1CH.12.20	When he went to Ziklag some Manassites deserted to him: Adnah, Jehozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, heads of the thousands that were for Manasseh. 
1CH.12.21	And they themselves helped David against the troops, for all of them were mighty men of strength and were commanders in the army. 
1CH.12.22	Day in and day out
1CH.12.23	And these are the numbers of the chiefs of those prepared for the army who came to David at Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him according to the word of Yahweh. 
1CH.12.24	The sons of Judah bearing shield and spear: six thousand eight hundred armed troops. 
1CH.12.25	From the men of Simeon, mighty warriors of strength for war: seven thousand one hundred. 
1CH.12.26	From the Levites: four thousand six hundred. 
1CH.12.27	Jehoiada the chief officer of the house of Aaron, and with him, three thousand seven hundred. 
1CH.12.28	And Zadok, a young man, a mighty warrior of strength, and the house of his father: twenty-two commanders. 
1CH.12.29	From the men of Benjamin, kinsmen of Saul, three thousand, and even still
1CH.12.30	And from the men of Ephraim: twenty thousand eight hundred mighty warriors of strength, famous men in the house of their fathers. 
1CH.12.31	And from the half-tribe of Manasseh: eighteen thousand who were designated by name to come to make David king. 
1CH.12.32	And from the men of Issachar: men who were skilled in understanding the times
1CH.12.33	From Zebulun, those who went out armed, equipped for battle with all the weapons of war: fifty thousand to help David with singleness of purpose.
1CH.12.34	From Naphtali: one thousand commanders; and those with them with shield and spear: thirty-seven thousand. 
1CH.12.35	From the Danites, those equipped for battle: twenty-eight thousand six hundred. 
1CH.12.36	And from Asher, those who went out armed and prepared for battle: forty thousand. 
1CH.12.37	And from beyond the Jordan, from the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all their weapons of war for battle: one hundred and twenty thousand. 
1CH.12.38	All these were men of war arrayed in battle line with a whole heart.
1CH.12.39	And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their kinsmen were prepared for them. 
1CH.12.40	And also their relatives, as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought food on donkeys, on camels, on mules, and on oxen—provisions of flour, cakes of figs, raisin cakes, wine and oil, cattle and sheep in abundance, for there was great joy in Israel. 
1CH.13.1	And David consulted with the commanders of thousands and hundreds, with every leader. 
1CH.13.2	And David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you
1CH.13.3	Then let us bring around the ark of our God to us, for we did not seek it in the days of Saul.” 
1CH.13.4	And all the assembly agreed to do so, for the word was pleasing in the eyes of all the people. 
1CH.13.5	And David summoned all Israel from Shihor of Egypt up to Lebo-Hamath to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-Jearim. 
1CH.13.6	And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, Kiriath-Jearim of Judah, to bring up from there the ark of Yahweh God who is enthroned between the cherubim, which is called the name. 
1CH.13.7	And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio were driving the cart. 
1CH.13.8	Now David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their strength, and with songs, lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets. 
1CH.13.9	And when they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzza reached out his hand to hold the ark because the cattle had stumbled. 
1CH.13.10	And Yahweh was angry
1CH.13.11	And David was angry
1CH.13.12	And David feared God on that day, saying, “How can I bring the ark of God home to me?” 
1CH.13.13	So David did not move the ark to himself into the city of David but diverted it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. 
1CH.13.14	And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And Yahweh blessed the household of Obed-Edom and all that he had. 
1CH.14.1	And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent messengers to David and cedar trees, masons,
1CH.14.2	And David knew that Yahweh had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel. 
1CH.14.3	And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David fathered more sons and daughters. 
1CH.14.4	Now these are the names of the children who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
1CH.14.5	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
1CH.14.6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
1CH.14.7	Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet. 
1CH.14.8	When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed as king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard and went out from before them. 
1CH.14.9	Now the Philistines came and carried out a raid in the Valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.14.10	Then David inquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you put them into my hand?” And Yahweh said to him, “Go up. I will put them into your hand.” 
1CH.14.11	And he went up to Baal-Perazim, and David struck them there. And David said, “God has burst out against my enemies by my hand like waters burst out.” Therefore they will call the name of this place Baal-Perazim. 
1CH.14.12	And they abandoned their gods there. And David commanded, and they were burnt with fire. 
1CH.14.13	Then the Philistines carried out another raid
1CH.14.14	Then David inquired again of God. And God said to him, “You shall not go up after them. Go around from before them and come against them the opposite way of the balsam trees. 
1CH.14.15	And it shall be that when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then go out into battle, for God goes out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.” 
1CH.14.16	And David did as God commanded him, and they struck the camp of the Philistines from Gibeon to Gezer. 
1CH.14.17	And the fame of David went out through all the lands. And Yahweh put the fear of him upon all the nations. 
1CH.15.1	And David built houses for himself in the city of David, and he established a place for the ark of God. And he pitched a tent for it. 
1CH.15.2	Then David ordered that none except the Levites should carry the ark of God, for Yahweh had chosen them to carry the ark of Yahweh and to serve him forever. 
1CH.15.3	And David gathered all Israel to Jerusalem to bring up the ark of Yahweh to its place that he had established for it. 
1CH.15.4	And David gathered the sons of Aaron and the Levites. 
1CH.15.5	Of the sons of Kohath: Uriel the chief and one hundred and twenty of his brothers. 
1CH.15.6	Of the sons of Merari: Asaiah the chief and two hundred and twenty of his brothers. 
1CH.15.7	Of the sons of Gershom: Joel the chief and one hundred and thirty of his brothers. 
1CH.15.8	Of the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the chief and two hundred of his brothers. 
1CH.15.9	Of the sons of Hebron: Eliel the chief and eighty of his brothers. 
1CH.15.10	Of the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the chief and one hundred and twelve of his brothers. 
1CH.15.11	Then David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. 
1CH.15.12	And he said to them, “You are the heads of the families
1CH.15.13	Because the first time you did not, and Yahweh our God burst out against us, for we did not care for it according to the law.” 
1CH.15.14	Then the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
1CH.15.15	And the sons of the Levites carried the ark of God according to what Moses commanded, according to the word of Yahweh, on their shoulders with the carrying poles upon them. 
1CH.15.16	Then David ordered the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with instruments of song, musical instruments, stringed instruments, and cymbals, raising their voices for joy.
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel, and from his brothers, Asaph the son of Berekiah, and from the sons of Merari, their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 
1CH.15.18	and with them their brothers of the second rank, Zechariah the son, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-Edom and Jeiel. 
1CH.15.19	Now the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were to sound bronze cymbals; 
1CH.15.20	Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play on harps according to Alamoth; 
1CH.15.21	and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to play lyres, directing according to the Sheminith. 
1CH.15.22	And Kenaniah, chief of the Levites in singing, was to be an instructor in singing because he understood. 
1CH.15.23	And Berekiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark. 
1CH.15.24	And Shebaniah, Jehoshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Elizezer the priests sounded the trumpets
1CH.15.25	And it happened that David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh from the house of Obed-Edom with joy. 
1CH.15.26	And it happened that when God helped the Levites carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. 
1CH.15.27	Now David was clothed with a robe of fine linen; so also all the Levites who were carrying the ark, the singers, and Kenaniah the chief of the singing. And David wore a linen ephod. 
1CH.15.28	And all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh with shouting, with the sound of a shofar,
1CH.15.29	And when the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the city of David, then Michal the daughter of Saul looked down from the window and saw the king, David, leaping and dancing. And she despised him in her heart. 
1CH.16.1	And they brought the ark of God and set it inside the tent that David had pitched for it. And they offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before God. 
1CH.16.2	And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh. 
1CH.16.3	And he distributed to every man of Israel, both men and women, to each person a loaf of bread, a cake of dates, and a cake of raisins. 
1CH.16.4	Then he appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the ark of Yahweh, to invoke, thank, and praise Yahweh the God of Israel. 
1CH.16.5	Asaph was chief, and his second was Zechariah; Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel were on harps and lyres. And Asaph played on the cymbals. 
1CH.16.6	And Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests blew on the trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. 
1CH.16.7	Then on that day David first appointed to give thanks to Yahweh by the hand of Asaph and his brothers. 
1CH.16.8	Give thanks to Yahweh; call upon his name; 
1CH.16.8	make known his deeds among the nations! 
1CH.16.9	Sing to him; sing praises to him; 
1CH.16.9	tell of his wondrous works! 
1CH.16.10	Glory in his holy name; 
1CH.16.10	let the hearts of those seeking Yahweh rejoice! 
1CH.16.11	Seek Yahweh and his strength; 
1CH.16.11	seek his face continually! 
1CH.16.12	Remember his wonderful works that he has done, 
1CH.16.12	his wonders and the judgments of his mouth, 
1CH.16.13	O offspring of Israel, his servant, 
1CH.16.13	O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones! 
1CH.16.14	He is Yahweh our God; 
1CH.16.14	his judgments are in all the earth. 
1CH.16.15	Remember his covenant forever, 
1CH.16.15	the word he commanded for a thousand generations, 
1CH.16.16	that he made
1CH.16.16	his sworn oath to Isaac. 
1CH.16.17	And he confirmed it to Jacob as a statute, 
1CH.16.17	an everlasting covenant to Israel, 
1CH.16.18	saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan, 
1CH.16.18	the portion of your inheritance.” 
1CH.16.19	When you were few in number, little, 
1CH.16.19	and sojourners were in it, 
1CH.16.20	when they wandered from nation to nation, 
1CH.16.20	and from one kingdom to another people, 
1CH.16.21	he did not allow anyone to oppress them, 
1CH.16.21	and he rebuked kings on their account, 
1CH.16.22	saying, “You must not touch my anointed 
1CH.16.22	nor do harm to my prophets!” 
1CH.16.23	Sing to Yahweh, all the earth! 
1CH.16.23	Proclaim his salvation from day to day! 
1CH.16.24	Proclaim his glory among the nations, 
1CH.16.24	his wondrous works among the peoples! 
1CH.16.25	For Yahweh is great and greatly praised, 
1CH.16.25	and he is feared among all gods. 
1CH.16.26	For all the gods of the nations are idols, 
1CH.16.26	but Yahweh made the heavens. 
1CH.16.27	Splendor and majesty are before him; 
1CH.16.27	strength and joy are in his place. 
1CH.16.28	Ascribe to Yahweh, O clans of the nations, 
1CH.16.28	ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength! 
1CH.16.29	Ascribe to Yahweh the glory of his name! 
1CH.16.29	Lift up an offering and come before him! 
1CH.16.29	Bow down to Yahweh in the splendor of holiness! 
1CH.16.30	Tremble before him, all the earth; 
1CH.16.30	surely the world shall not be shaken. 
1CH.16.31	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad, 
1CH.16.31	and let them tell the peoples, “Yahweh reigns!” 
1CH.16.32	Let the sea roar and its fullness; 
1CH.16.32	let the field rejoice and all that is in it. 
1CH.16.33	Then the trees of the forest shall sing for joy before Yahweh, 
1CH.16.33	for he comes to judge the earth. 
1CH.16.34	Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good; 
1CH.16.34	his loyal love is everlasting. 
1CH.16.35	Then say, “Save us, O God of our salvation; 
1CH.16.35	gather us and rescue us from the nations 
1CH.16.35	that we may give thanks to your holy name 
1CH.16.35	and glory in your praise. 
1CH.16.36	Blessed be Yahweh the God of Israel, 
1CH.16.36	from everlasting to everlasting!” 
1CH.16.36	Then all the people said, “Amen!” and praised Yahweh. 
1CH.16.37	So he
1CH.16.38	and he left Obed-Edom with his sixty-eight brothers. And Obed-Edom, the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah were gatekeepers. 
1CH.16.39	And he left Zadok the priest and his brothers the priests before the tabernacle of Yahweh at the high place which was at Gibeon 
1CH.16.40	to offer burnt offerings regularly to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering, morning and evening, according to all that was written in the law of Yahweh that he commanded concerning Israel. 
1CH.16.41	And with them were Heman and Jeduthun and the remainder of those chosen, who were designated by name to give thanks to Yahweh, for his loyal love is everlasting. 
1CH.16.42	And Heman and Jeduthun with them had trumpets and cymbals for making music, along with instruments for the song of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were at the gate. 
1CH.16.43	Then all the people went each to his house, and David turned to bless his household. 
1CH.17.1	And as David lived in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Look, I live in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is under tent curtains.” 
1CH.17.2	And Nathan said to David, “Whatever is in your heart, do, for God is with you.” 
1CH.17.3	And it happened that same night the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
1CH.17.4	“Go and say to David my servant, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “You are not to build a house for me to live in, 
1CH.17.5	for I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought out Israel unto this day. I have been from tent to tent and from tabernacle to tabernacle. 
1CH.17.6	In every place I have moved about, did I say one word with the judges of Israel I commanded to shepherd my people, saying, ‘Why have you not built for me a house of cedar?’ ” ’ 
1CH.17.7	So now, thus you shall say to my servant David, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, “I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be leader over my people Israel, 
1CH.17.8	and I have been with you wherever you went and have cut down your enemies from before you and will make a name for you, like the name of the great ones on the earth. 
1CH.17.9	And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them,
1CH.17.10	from the day that I commanded judges over my people Israel. And I will subdue your enemies, and I declare to you that Yahweh will build for you a house.
1CH.17.11	And it shall be that when your days are fulfilled to go and sleep with your ancestors,
1CH.17.12	He himself will build for me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. 
1CH.17.13	I myself will be a father to him, and he himself will be a son to me. And I will not remove my steadfast love from him as I took it away from whoever was before you. 
1CH.17.14	And I will establish him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.” ’ ” 
1CH.17.15	According to all these words and according to all this revelation, thus did Nathan speak to David. 
1CH.17.16	Then King David went and sat before Yahweh and said, “Who am I, O Yahweh God, and what is my house that you have brought me thus far? 
1CH.17.17	And this was a small matter in your eyes, O God. And you have spoken concerning the house of your servant for a long time and have shown me future generations to come,
1CH.17.18	What more
1CH.17.19	O Yahweh, for the sake of your servant and according to your heart you have done all this greatness, to make known all these great things. 
1CH.17.20	O Yahweh, there is none like you, and there is no God except you, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 
1CH.17.21	And who is like your people Israel, the one nation upon earth whom God went to redeem for himself, to establish for you a reputation
1CH.17.22	And you made your people Israel an everlasting nation for yourself. And you, O Yahweh, became their God. 
1CH.17.23	So now, O Yahweh, let the word that you spoke to your servant and to his house be established forever, that you might do what you have spoken. 
1CH.17.24	And let your name be established and be magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel’s God, and may the house of David your servant be established before you.’ 
1CH.17.25	For you, my God, have informed
1CH.17.26	So now, O Yahweh, you yourself are God, and you have spoken to your servant this good thing. 
1CH.17.27	And now may you begin to bless the house of your servant to continue forever
1CH.18.1	And it happened that after David struck the Philistines and subdued them, he captured Gath and its villages out of the hand of the Philistines. 
1CH.18.2	And he struck Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David, bearing tribute. 
1CH.18.3	And David struck Hadadezer, king of Zobah-Hamath, as he set up his monument at the Euphrates River. 
1CH.18.4	And David captured from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. And David hamstrung all the chariot horses but left one hundred of them to remain for chariots. 
1CH.18.5	And when the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah-Hamath, David struck down twenty-two thousand men of Aram. 
1CH.18.6	Then David set up garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became servants to David, bearing tribute. And Yahweh delivered David wherever he went. 
1CH.18.7	And David took small round shields of gold that were upon the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David captured very much bronze. Solomon made the bronze sea with it along with the columns and objects of bronze. 
1CH.18.9	And when Tou the king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Hadadezer the king of Zobah, 
1CH.18.10	he sent Hadoram his son to King David to ask him for peace and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him, for Tou had been at war
1CH.18.11	King David dedicated these also to Yahweh, along with the silver and gold that he had taken from all the nations, from Edom, Moab, the sons of Ammon, the Philistines, and Amalek. 
1CH.18.12	And Abishai son of Zeruiah defeated eighteen thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt. 
1CH.18.13	And he put garrisons in Edom, and all Edom became servants to David. And Yahweh delivered David wherever he went. 
1CH.18.14	So David reigned over all Israel, and he administered justice
1CH.18.15	And Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder. 
1CH.18.16	And Zadok son of Ahitub and Abimelech son of Abiathar were priests, and Shavsha was secretary. 
1CH.18.17	And Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and the Pelethites. And the sons of David were chief officials under the hand of the king. 
1CH.19.1	And it happened that after this Nahash the king of the Ammonites
1CH.19.2	And David said, “I will deal kindly with Hanun the son of Nahash because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And the servants of David came to the land of the Ammonites,
1CH.19.3	But the princes of the Ammonites
1CH.19.4	So Hanun took the servants of David and shaved them and cut off their garments at the middle, up to the buttocks, and sent them away. 
1CH.19.5	And they went and told David concerning the men, and he inquired of them, for the men were very disgraced. And the king said, “Dwell in Jericho until your beards grow out; then return.” 
1CH.19.6	And when the Ammonites
1CH.19.7	And they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah and his people, and they came and encamped before Medeba. And the Ammonites
1CH.19.8	And when David heard, he sent Joab and the entire army of mighty warriors. 
1CH.19.9	And the Ammonites
1CH.19.10	When Joab saw that there was a battle line
1CH.19.11	And the remainder of the people he put in the hand of Abishai his brother, and they were arranged to meet the Ammonites.
1CH.19.12	And he said, “If Aram is too strong for me, then you must be a help to me, but if the Ammonites
1CH.19.13	Be strong! Let us strengthen ourselves on behalf of our people and on behalf of the cities of our God. And may Yahweh do what is good in his eyes.” 
1CH.19.14	And Joab and the people who were with him drew near before Aram for battle, and they fled before him. 
1CH.19.15	And when the Ammonites
1CH.19.16	And when Aram saw that they were defeated before Israel, they sent messengers and brought out Aram, who was from beyond the Euphrates,
1CH.19.17	And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan. And he came to them and was arrayed against them. Then David was arrayed to meet Aram in battle, and they fought with him. 
1CH.19.18	And Aram fled before Israel. And David killed from Aram the men of seven thousand chariots and forty thousand foot soldiers, and he put to death Shophach the commander of the army. 
1CH.19.19	And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with David and became servants to him. So Aram was no longer willing to help the Ammonites.
1CH.20.1	And it happened that in the spring time of year,
1CH.20.2	And David took the crown of their king from his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold. And in it was a precious stone. Then it was placed upon the head of David. And he brought out the booty of the city, a large amount. 
1CH.20.3	And the people who were in it he brought out, and he set them to work with saws and iron implements and axes.
1CH.20.4	And after this there arose a war in Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaim. And they were subdued. 
1CH.20.5	And again there was war with the Philistines. And Elhanan son of Jair struck down Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 
1CH.20.6	And again there was war in Gath. And there was a very tall
1CH.20.7	And he taunted Israel, but Jehonathan son of Shimea, brother of David, struck him down. 
1CH.20.8	These were born to the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants. 
1CH.21.1	Then Satan
1CH.21.2	So David said to Joab and to the commanders of the nation, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba to Dan and bring a report to me that I might know their number.” 
1CH.21.3	But Joab said, “May Yahweh add to the people a hundred times what they are! Are they not, O my lord the king, all of them the king’s servants? Why does my lord seek this? Why would he bring guilt to Israel?” 
1CH.21.4	But the word of the king prevailed over Joab. Then he went about through all Israel and came to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	And Joab gave the number of the enrollment of the people to David. And it happened that all Israel was one million one hundred thousand men drawing a sword, and in Judah were four hundred and seventy thousand men drawing a sword. 
1CH.21.6	But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the word of the king was repulsive to Joab. 
1CH.21.7	But this word was displeasing in the eyes of God, and he struck Israel. 
1CH.21.8	Then David said to God, “I have sinned severely in that I have done this thing. But now, please forgive the sin of your servant, for I have been very foolish.” 
1CH.21.9	Then Yahweh spoke to Gad the seer of David, saying, 
1CH.21.10	“Go, you must speak to David, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “Three choices I offer to you. Choose one of them for yourself that I will do to you.” ’ ” 
1CH.21.11	So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Choose for yourself: 
1CH.21.12	whether three years of famine or three months of devastation by your enemies while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or three days of the sword of Yahweh, with disease in the land and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the territory in Israel.’ So now, see what word I should return to my sender.” 
1CH.21.13	Then David said to Gad, “I am very troubled.
1CH.21.14	So Yahweh sent a pestilence through Israel, and seventy thousand men from Israel fell. 
1CH.21.15	And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, and as he was about to destroy it, Yahweh saw and was grieved on account of the calamity. Then he said to the angel, the destroyer, “It is enough; slacken your hand.” And the angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
1CH.21.16	And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and heaven, with his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. 
1CH.21.17	Then David said to God, “Was it not I who gave a command to count the people? Now I am he who has sinned, and I have certainly done wickedness, but these sheep, what have they done? O Yahweh, my God, please let your hand be against me and against the house of my father, but against your people, let there be no plague.” 
1CH.21.18	Now the angel of Yahweh had spoken to Gad to say to David that David should go up and erect an altar for Yahweh. 
1CH.21.19	So David went up at the word of Gad that he had spoken in the name of Yahweh. 
1CH.21.20	Now Ornan was threshing wheat, and Ornan turned and saw the angel, and his four sons with him hid themselves. 
1CH.21.21	Then David came to Ornan, and Ornan looked and saw David. And he went out from the threshing floor, and they bowed down to David, faces to the ground. 
1CH.21.22	Then David said to Ornan, “Please give me the place, the threshing floor, that I might build an altar on it to Yahweh; at full price please give it to me, that the plague against the people might be stopped.” 
1CH.21.23	And Ornan said to David, “Take it to yourself; let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes. See, I give the cattle for the burnt offerings and threshing sledges for the wood and wheat for the grain offering—I give it all.” 
1CH.21.24	But King David said to Ornan, “No, for I will certainly buy it at full value; indeed, I will not take what is yours for Yahweh and offer burnt offerings for nothing.” 
1CH.21.25	So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place. 
1CH.21.26	Then David built an altar there to Yahweh, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and he called to Yahweh. And he answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering. 
1CH.21.27	Then Yahweh commanded the angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath. 
1CH.21.28	At that time, when David saw that Yahweh answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there. 
1CH.21.29	Now the tabernacle of Yahweh that Moses had made in the desert and the altar of burnt offering were at that time at the high place of Gibeon. 
1CH.21.30	But David was not able to go before it to seek God, for he was afraid on account of the sword of the angel of Yahweh. 
1CH.22.1	 Then David said, “This will be the house of Yahweh God, and this altar of burnt offering for Israel.” 
1CH.22.2	And David commanded to assemble the resident aliens who were in the land of Israel and appointed stone craftsmen to cut dressed stones to build the house of God. 
1CH.22.3	And David provided much iron for nails for the doors of the gates and for the seams, and abundant copper that could not be weighed, 
1CH.22.4	and cedar timbers without number, for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought abundant cedars to David. 
1CH.22.5	Then David said, “Solomon my son is a boy and inexperienced, and the house built for Yahweh must be exceedingly great in fame and splendor throughout every land. I will make preparations for him.” So David provided abundant materials before he died. 
1CH.22.6	Then he called to Solomon his son and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
1CH.22.7	And David said to Solomon his son, “I myself had in my heart to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, 
1CH.22.8	but it happened that the word of Yahweh came over me, saying, ‘You have shed much blood and have made much war; you shall not build a house for my name because you have shed much blood upon the ground before me. 
1CH.22.9	Behold, a son shall be born to you; he himself will be a man of rest, and I will give rest to him from all his enemies all around, for his name will be Solomon, and peace and quietness I will give to Israel in his days. 
1CH.22.10	He himself will build a house for my name, and he himself will be to me a son, and I will be to him as a father, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’ 
1CH.22.11	Now, my son, Yahweh will be with you, that you may succeed and build the house of Yahweh your God as he has spoken concerning you. 
1CH.22.12	Only may Yahweh give to you understanding and insight that he might give you charge over Israel and the keeping of the law of Yahweh your God. 
1CH.22.13	Then you will prosper if you take care to do the statutes and judgments which Yahweh commanded Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and be courageous; fear not and do not be dismayed. 
1CH.22.14	Now see, with great effort I have made provision for the house of Yahweh: 100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron that cannot be weighed, for there is an abundance. Also timber and stone I have provided, but to these you should add. 
1CH.22.15	And with you there is an abundance of craftsmen: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and everyone skilled in every kind of craftsmanship 
1CH.22.16	with gold, silver, bronze, and iron without number. Arise and work! Yahweh will be with you!” 
1CH.22.17	And David commanded all the commanders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, 
1CH.22.18	“Is not Yahweh your God with you? And has he not given you rest all around? For he has put in my hand the inhabitants of the land, and the land is subdued before Yahweh and before his people. 
1CH.22.19	Now set your heart and mind to seek Yahweh your God, and arise and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God, that the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and the holy vessels of God might be brought into the house built for the name of Yahweh. 
1CH.23.1	Now David was old and full of days. And he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 
1CH.23.2	And he assembled all the commanders of Israel and the priests and the Levites. 
1CH.23.3	And the Levites thirty years old and above were counted, and their number according to their head count for the men was thirty-eight thousand. 
1CH.23.4	Of these, David said, “Twenty-four thousand are to direct the work of the house of Yahweh, along with six thousand judges and officials, 
1CH.23.5	four thousand gatekeepers, and four thousand offering praise with the instruments that I have made for praise.” 
1CH.23.6	And David organized them in divisions according to the sons of Levi: to Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
1CH.23.7	For the Gershonites were Ladan and Shimei. 
1CH.23.8	The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief and Zetham and Joel, three. 
1CH.23.9	The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the families
1CH.23.10	And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah; these four were the sons of Shimei. 
1CH.23.11	And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons. They were enrolled as one for the house of a father. 
1CH.23.12	The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 
1CH.23.13	The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was set apart to consecrate the most holy things. He and his sons were to burn offerings forever before Yahweh to serve him and to bless in his name forever. 
1CH.23.14	But Moses the man of God and his sons were reckoned among the tribe of Levi. 
1CH.23.15	The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. 
1CH.23.16	The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. 
1CH.23.17	And the sons of Eliezer were Rehabiah, the head. And Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. 
1CH.23.18	The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief. 
1CH.23.19	The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 
1CH.23.20	The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief and Isshiah the second. 
1CH.23.21	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. 
1CH.23.22	And Eleazar died, and he did not have sons, but only daughters. And the sons of Kish, their relatives, married them. 
1CH.23.23	The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three. 
1CH.23.24	These were the sons of Levi according to the house of their fathers, the heads of the families,
1CH.23.25	For David said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people, and he dwells in Jerusalem forever. 
1CH.23.26	And also, the Levites do not need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.” 
1CH.23.27	For by the last words of David, they are the number of the sons of Levi, from twenty years old and above. 
1CH.23.28	For their station was to assist
1CH.23.29	and with the rows of bread, the flour, the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baked offering, the offering mixed with oil, and for all the amounts and measurements. 
1CH.23.30	And they were to stand every morning,
1CH.23.31	and for every burnt offering offered to Yahweh, on Sabbaths, on new moon festivals, and at the appointed feasts, according to the customary number required of them,
1CH.23.32	And they shall keep the responsibility of the tent of assembly,
1CH.24.1	And as for the sons of Aaron, these were their divisions. The sons of Aaron were Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
1CH.24.2	And Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and they had no sons,
1CH.24.3	And David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their appointments for their service. 
1CH.24.4	And more sons of Eleazar were found as heads of the men than the sons of Ithamar, so they divided them to the sons of Eleazar to be sixteen heads over the house of the fathers, and to the sons of Ithamar over the house of the fathers were eight heads. 
1CH.24.5	They divided them by lot all alike,
1CH.24.6	And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel, the scribe, from the Levites, recorded them before the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the families
1CH.24.7	And the first lot went out to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, 
1CH.24.8	the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 
1CH.24.9	the fifth to Malkijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 
1CH.24.10	the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, 
1CH.24.11	the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shekaniah, 
1CH.24.12	the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 
1CH.24.13	the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, 
1CH.24.14	the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, 
1CH.24.15	the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Ha-Pizzez, 
1CH.24.16	the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Ezekiel, 
1CH.24.17	the twenty-first to Jakin, the twenty-second to Gamul, 
1CH.24.18	the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah. 
1CH.24.19	These were their appointments for their service to come into the house of Yahweh according to their custom by the hand of Aaron their father, as Yahweh the God of Israel had commanded him. 
1CH.24.20	And as for the remainder of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah. 
1CH.24.21	Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief. 
1CH.24.22	Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons Shelomoth, Jahath. 
1CH.24.23	Of the sons of Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. 
1CH.24.24	The sons of Uzziel, Micah; the sons of Micah, Shamur. 
1CH.24.25	The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah. 
1CH.24.26	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah, his son.
1CH.24.27	The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, his son,
1CH.24.28	Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. 
1CH.24.29	Of Kish: the sons of Kish, Jerahmeel. 
1CH.24.30	And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites according to the house of their fathers. 
1CH.24.31	And lots were also cast for these, just as their brothers, the sons of Aaron, before David the king, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the families
1CH.25.1	And David and the commanders of the army set apart for the service the sons of Asaph, of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who prophesied with stringed instruments, with harps, and with cymbals. And their inventory of the men of the work and for their duty was: 
1CH.25.2	for the sons of Asaph: Zakkur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah, sons of Asaph, under the hand
1CH.25.3	Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah,
1CH.25.4	Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth. 
1CH.25.5	All these were sons to Heman, the seer of the king, according to the words of God to raise a horn.

1CH.27.33	And Ahithophel was an adviser to the king, and Hushai the Arkite was a friend of the king. 
1CH.27.34	And after Ahithophel came Jehoiada, the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. And Joab was the commander of the king’s army.

1CH.28.2	And King David rose to his feet and said, “Listen to me, my brothers and my people. I myself wanted
1CH.28.3	But God said to me, ‘You may not build a house for my name because you are a man of war, and you have shed blood.’ 
1CH.28.4	But Yahweh the God of Israel chose me from all of the house of my father to be king over Israel forever, for he chose Judah as leader, and in the house of Judah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to reign over all Israel. 
1CH.28.5	And from all my sons—for Yahweh has given many sons to me—he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of Yahweh over Israel. 
1CH.28.6	And he said to me, ‘Solomon your son, he himself shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him as a son to myself, and I myself will be as a father to him, 
1CH.28.7	and I will establish his kingdom forever if he firmly performs
1CH.28.8	So now in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Yahweh, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek all the commandments of Yahweh your God so that you may take possession of this good land and bestow it as an inheritance to your children after you forever.” 
1CH.28.9	“And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and a willing mind, for Yahweh searches all hearts and understands every plan and all thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you abandon him, he will reject you forever. 
1CH.28.10	Look now, for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong and do it!” 
1CH.28.11	Then David gave to Solomon his son the plan of the vestibule and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, its inner chambers, and of the house of the lid of the ark, 
1CH.28.12	and the plan of all that he had in mind
1CH.28.13	and for the working groups of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh, and for all the vessels for the service of the house of Yahweh, 
1CH.28.14	and for the gold, according to the weight of the gold for all the vessels of the service, and the service of all the vessels of silver according to the weight of all the vessels for every kind of service.
1CH.28.15	And the weight of the golden lampstands and the golden lamps, the weight of each lampstand and each lamp,
1CH.28.16	and the weight of gold for the tables of the arranged bread, each table,
1CH.28.17	and pure gold for the three-pronged meat forks, and the bowls and the pitchers, and for the golden bowls, by weight for each bowl,
1CH.28.18	and for the altar of incense made of refined gold, by weight, and gold for the plan for the chariot—the cherubim with outspread and covering wings over the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. 
1CH.28.19	“All this I give you in writing; from the hand of Yahweh he instructed me about all the workings of this plan.” 
1CH.28.20	Then David said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous, and do this! Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed, for Yahweh God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you and will not forsake you until all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh is finished. 
1CH.28.21	And behold, the working groups of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and with you in all the work for all those willing with the skill for every service, and the commanders and all the people for all your commands.” 
1CH.29.1	Then David the king said to all the assembly, “God has chosen Solomon my son alone, a young man and inexperienced, and the work is great, for the citadel is not for humankind, but for Yahweh God. 
1CH.29.2	So I have provided for the house of my God according to all my strength, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and the wood for the things of wood, along with an abundance of onyx stones, stones for settings, stones of turquoise, and variegated stones, and all kinds of precious stones and alabaster stones. 
1CH.29.3	And moreover, with respect to my provisions for the house of my God I have a treasure of gold and silver that I have given to the house of my God above all that I have provided for the holy house: 
1CH.29.4	three thousand talents of gold from the gold of Ophir and seven thousand talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the houses, 
1CH.29.5	gold for the golden things and silver for the silver things, for all the work by the hand of skilled craftsmen. Now who will offer willingly, consecrating himself
1CH.29.6	Then the commanders of the families,
1CH.29.7	And they gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. 
1CH.29.8	And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of Yahweh under the authority
1CH.29.9	And the people rejoiced over their freewill offering, for with a whole heart they had willingly offered to Yahweh, and King David also rejoiced with great joy. 
1CH.29.10	Then David blessed Yahweh in the sight of all the assembly, and David said, “Blessed are you, O Yahweh, God of Israel, our father forever and ever! 
1CH.29.11	To you, O Yahweh, is the greatness and the power and the splendor and the glory and the strength, for everything in the heavens and in the earth. Yours, O Yahweh, is the kingdom and exaltation over all as head! 
1CH.29.12	And wealth and glory are from you, and you rule over all. And in your hand is power and might. And in your hand is power to make great and to give strength to all. 
1CH.29.13	And now, our God, we give thanks to you and offer praise to the name of your splendor. 
1CH.29.14	And indeed, who am I, and who are my people that we retain power to offer according to these offerings willingly? For everything is from you, and from your hand we have given to you. 
1CH.29.15	For we are strangers before you and sojourners like all our ancestors.
1CH.29.16	O Yahweh our God, all this abundance that we have provided to build for you a house for your holy name is from your hand, and all of it is yours. 
1CH.29.17	And I know, my God, that you yourself test the heart and are pleased with uprightness. I, in the uprightness of my heart, have willingly offered all these things, and now I have seen your people who are found here willingly offer to you. 
1CH.29.18	O Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our ancestors,
1CH.29.19	Grant to Solomon my son a heart of peace to keep your commands, your statutes, and your regulations to do everything, and to build the citadel for which I have provided.” 
1CH.29.20	And David said to all the assembly, “Bless Yahweh your God!” And all the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their ancestors.
1CH.29.21	And they offered sacrifices to Yahweh, and on that next day they offered burnt offerings to Yahweh: one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, one thousand lambs, with their libations and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. 
1CH.29.22	And they ate and drank before Yahweh on that day with great joy. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and they anointed him commander for Yahweh, and Zadok the priest. 
1CH.29.23	Then Solomon sat upon the throne of Yahweh as king in place of David his father. And he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him. 
1CH.29.24	And all the officials and mighty warriors, and also all the sons of King David, pledged allegiance to
1CH.29.25	And Yahweh made Solomon exceedingly great in the sight of all Israel, and he bestowed upon him royal splendor that was not bestowed upon any king before him in Israel. 
1CH.29.26	And David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
1CH.29.27	And the days that he reigned over Israel were forty years. In Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years. 
1CH.29.28	And he died in a good old age, full of days, wealth, and honor. And Solomon his son reigned in his place. 
1CH.29.29	Now the words of King David, from the first to the last, see, they are written among the words of Samuel the seer, and among the words of Nathan the prophet, and among the words of Gad the seer, 
1CH.29.30	with all the accounts of his kingdom, his power, and the times that came upon him, and upon Israel, and upon all the kingdoms of the earth. 
2CH.1.1	And Solomon the son of David strengthened himself concerning his kingdom, and Yahweh his God was with him and made him exceedingly great. 
2CH.1.2	And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the leaders for all Israel, the heads of the families.
2CH.1.3	And Solomon and the whole assembly with him went to the high place that was at Gibeon, for the tent of assembly
2CH.1.4	(But the ark of God David had brought up from Kiriath-Jearim to the place David had prepared for it, for David had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.) 
2CH.1.5	And the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh. And Solomon and the assembly sought it out. 
2CH.1.6	And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the tent of assembly,
2CH.1.7	On that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask what I shall give to you.” 
2CH.1.8	Then Solomon said to God, “You yourself have shown steadfast
2CH.1.9	Now, O Yahweh God, let your word to David my father be fulfilled, for you yourself have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth. 
2CH.1.10	Now, give to me wisdom and knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can judge this, your great people?” 
2CH.1.11	Then God said to Solomon, “Because this was with your heart and you did not ask for wealth, possessions, honor, and the lives of your enemies, and also did not ask for long life,
2CH.1.12	wisdom and knowledge is given to you. And I will also give to you wealth, possessions, and honor, the like of which was not had by the kings who were before you, nor will there be the like after you.” 
2CH.1.13	So Solomon went from the high place which was at Gibeon to Jerusalem before the tent of assembly.
2CH.1.14	And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. And he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, and he placed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 
2CH.1.15	And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem like the stones. And he made cedar as abundant as the sycamore fig trees that were in the Shephelah. 
2CH.1.16	And Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue. The traders of the king received them from Kue at a price. 
2CH.1.17	They went up and exported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for one hundred and fifty shekels. And these were likewise exported
2CH.2.1	 And Solomon planned to build a house for the name of Yahweh and a royal palace for himself.
2CH.2.2	And Solomon assigned seventy thousand men to bear burdens
2CH.2.3	And Solomon sent word to Huram
2CH.2.4	Look, I am building a house for the name of Yahweh my God to dedicate to him, to offer sweet spices of incense before him, and for the regular rows of bread, and burnt offerings for mornings, evenings, Sabbaths, and new moon festivals, and for appointed feasts of Yahweh our God which are everlasting for Israel. 
2CH.2.5	And the house that I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all gods. 
2CH.2.6	Now who indeed has adequate strength to build a house for him? For the heavens and the highest heavens
2CH.2.7	So then, send to me skilled men to work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and with purple, crimson, and blue fabric, knowledgeable in engraving, with the skilled men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father has established. 
2CH.2.8	Send me trees of cedar, cypress, and algum from Lebanon, for I myself know that your servants are knowledgeable in cutting the trees of Lebanon. Now see, my servants will be with your servants 
2CH.2.9	to prepare trees in abundance for me, for the house that I am building will be great and wonderful. 
2CH.2.10	Now see, I will provide twenty thousand dry measures of crushed wheat, twenty thousand dry measures of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil to the woodcarvers and those who cut timber.” 
2CH.2.11	Then Huram
2CH.2.12	Then Huram
2CH.2.13	So now I have sent a skilled man, knowledgeable and with understanding: my master
2CH.2.14	a son of a woman from the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, knowledgeable for working with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and with purple, blue, and crimson fabric, and with fine linen, for engraving any engraving and devising any plan that is given to him, with your skilled men and the skilled men of my lord David your father. 
2CH.2.15	Now as for the wheat, barley, oil, and wine that my lord mentioned, let him send that to his servants. 
2CH.2.16	And we ourselves will cut trees from Lebanon according to all your need, and we will bring them to you on rafts over the sea to Joppa, so that you may bring them up to Jerusalem.” 
2CH.2.17	Then Solomon counted all the resident alien men who were in the land of Israel after the census that David his father had taken of them. And there were found one hundred and fifty-three thousand. 
2CH.2.18	And he appointed from them seventy thousand to bear burdens,
2CH.3.1	Then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem, on Mount Moriah, where Yahweh had appeared to David his father, at the place that David had established, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
2CH.3.2	And he began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign. 
2CH.3.3	Now these were the measurements of Solomon for building the house of God: the length in cubits by the former measurement was sixty cubits, and the width was twenty cubits. 
2CH.3.4	The length of the portico that was in front was the same as the front of the width of the house:
2CH.3.5	And the great house itself he covered with cypress wood, then he overlaid it with pure gold. And he put on it palm tree images and ornate chains. 
2CH.3.6	Then he overlaid the house with precious stone as decoration. (Now the gold was the gold of Parvaim.) 
2CH.3.7	And he overlaid the house with gold—the beams, the thresholds, the walls, and the doors. And he carved cherubim upon the walls. 
2CH.3.8	Then he made the most holy place.
2CH.3.9	And the weight for the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid its upper rooms with gold. 
2CH.3.10	And he made two sculpted wood cherubim in the most holy place,
2CH.3.11	The length of the outstretched wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits; one wing of five cubits touched the wall of the house, and the other wing of five cubits was touching the outstretched wing of the other cherub. 
2CH.3.12	And the wing of five cubits of the other cherub was touching the wall of the house, and its other wing five cubits long touching the wing of the first
2CH.3.13	The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits, and they were standing on their feet, their faces toward the house. 
2CH.3.14	And he made the curtain of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen, and put cherubim on it. 
2CH.3.15	And at the front of the house he made two columns, thirty-five cubits high, and the capital on their top was five cubits. 
2CH.3.16	And he made decorative chains in the inner sanctuary and put them on top of the columns. And he made one hundred pomegranate ornaments, and put them on the chains. 
2CH.3.17	And he erected the columns in front of the temple, one on the south and one on the north. He called the name of the southern one Jakin, and the name of the northern one Boaz. 
2CH.4.1	And he made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits was its length, and twenty cubits was its width, and ten cubits was its height. 
2CH.4.2	Then he made the sea of molten metal, from brim to brim it was ten cubits, completely round. And it was five cubits in height, and its circumference measured
2CH.4.3	Under it were figures of oxen all around it, ten cubits high, encircling the sea all around. The oxen were in two rows cast as one piece with it.
2CH.4.4	It was standing upon twelve oxen, three facing north, and three facing west, and three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set upon them from above, and all their hindquarters faced inward.
2CH.4.5	And its thickness was a handbreadth, and its brim was like the working of the lip of a cup, the blossom of a lily. And it held three thousand baths. 
2CH.4.6	And he made ten basins. And he set five on the south and five on the north in which to wash; they washed off the work of the burnt offering in them, but the sea was for the priests to wash therein. 
2CH.4.7	And he made ten golden lampstands according to their custom, and he set them in the temple, five on the south and five on the north. 
2CH.4.8	And he made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south and five on the north. And he made a hundred drinking bowls of gold. 
2CH.4.9	And he made the courtyard of the priests and the great outer courtyard and the doors for the outer court. And he overlaid their doors with bronze. 
2CH.4.10	And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the temple. 
2CH.4.11	And Huram
2CH.4.12	the two columns, the bowls, and the two capitals on top of the columns, and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on top of the columns, 
2CH.4.13	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for the latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were before the columns. 
2CH.4.14	And he made the water carts, and he made the basins on the water carts, 
2CH.4.15	and the one sea and the twelve oxen underneath it. 
2CH.4.16	And Huram-abi made for King Solomon the pots, the shovels, the three-pronged meat forks, and all the utensils of polished bronze for the house of Yahweh. 
2CH.4.17	The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay soil between Succoth and Zeredah. 
2CH.4.18	Solomon made all these utensils in great abundance, for the weight of the bronze could not be determined. 
2CH.4.19	So Solomon made all the objects that were in the house of God: the altar of gold; the tables upon which was the bread of the presence; 
2CH.4.20	the lampstands, and the lamps for burning according to the custom before the inner sanctuary, of solid gold; 
2CH.4.21	and the blossoms, the lamps, and the tongs that were of solid gold; 
2CH.4.22	and the snuffers, the drinking bowls, the dishes, and the firepans, of solid gold; and the entrance to the house, the inner doors to the most holy place, and the doors to the house of the temple were of gold. 
2CH.5.1	When all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yahweh was finished, Solomon brought the holy objects of David his father: the silver, the gold, and all the objects he had put into the storehouses of the house of God. 
2CH.5.2	Then Solomon assembled all the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the families
2CH.5.3	And all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the feast that is in the seventh month. 
2CH.5.4	And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark. 
2CH.5.5	And they brought up the ark, the tent of assembly,
2CH.5.6	And King Solomon and the whole community of Israel that was assembled before him were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted nor numbered for abundance. 
2CH.5.7	Then the priests brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place in the inner sanctuary of the house, into the most holy place, underneath the wings of the cherubim. 
2CH.5.8	The cherubim were spreading their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim were covering the ark and over its poles from above. 
2CH.5.9	But the poles were so long that the ends of the poles from the ark were seen from before the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from the outside. And they are there until this day. 
2CH.5.10	There was nothing in the ark but the two stone tablets that Moses had put inside at Horeb on which Yahweh had made
2CH.5.11	And when the priests came out of the sanctuary (for all the priests who were present
2CH.5.12	and all the Levitical singers—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, their sons, their brothers, dressed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and stringed instruments—they were standing to the east of the altar. And with them outside were one hundred and twenty priests who were trumpet blowers. 
2CH.5.13	And it was the primary duty of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard with one voice, to praise and give thanks to Yahweh. And when a sound from the trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments of song was raised to Yahweh—for he is good, because his loyal love is everlasting—then the house, the house of Yahweh, was filled with a cloud. 
2CH.5.14	And the priests were not able to stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of God. 
2CH.6.1	Then Solomon said, “Yahweh has decided
2CH.6.2	But I have built for you an exalted house, even a place for you to dwell in forever.” 
2CH.6.3	Then the king turned around
2CH.6.4	And he said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth with David my father, and with his hands he has fulfilled it, saying, 
2CH.6.5	‘From the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt I did not choose a city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house in order for my name to be there. Nor did I choose a man to be leader over my people Israel. 
2CH.6.6	But I have chosen my name to be there in Jerusalem, and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’ 
2CH.6.7	Now, it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
2CH.6.8	But Yahweh said to David my father, ‘Because it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart, 
2CH.6.9	but you yourself will not build the house, but your son who will proceed from your loins; he himself will build the house for my name.’ 
2CH.6.10	Now Yahweh has fulfilled his word that he spoke. I have risen in the place of David my father and am seated on the throne of Israel as Yahweh has spoken. I have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
2CH.6.11	And I have there the ark in which is the covenant of Yahweh that he made
2CH.6.12	Then Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh before all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands. 
2CH.6.13	(For Solomon had made a platform of bronze five cubits long and five cubits wide and three cubits high, and placed it in the midst of the outer court.) And he stood upon it, then knelt down on his knees before the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands to heaven. 
2CH.6.14	And he said, “O Yahweh, God of Israel, there is none like you, a God in the heavens and on the earth, keeping the covenant and loyal love with your servants who walk before you with all their heart, 
2CH.6.15	that you have kept for your servant David my father what you spoke to him. You spoke with your mouth, and by your hand you have fulfilled it on this day. 
2CH.6.16	And now, O Yahweh, God of Israel, keep for your servant David, my father, what you have spoken to him, saying, ‘You shall not lack
2CH.6.17	And now, O Yahweh, God of Israel, let your word that you have spoken to your servant David be confirmed. 
2CH.6.18	“But will God indeed dwell with humankind upon the earth? Look, the heavens and the highest heavens
2CH.6.19	But turn to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, O Yahweh my God, to hearken to the pleading and to the prayer that your servant is praying before you, 
2CH.6.20	that your eyes may be open day and night to this house, to the place that you have promised to place your name there, that you may hear the prayer that your servant has prayed to this place. 
2CH.6.21	And listen to the pleas of your servant and your people Israel when they pray toward this place, that you yourself might hear from the place of your dwelling, from the heavens, that you might hear and forgive. 
2CH.6.22	“If a man sins against his neighbor and makes him swear an oath
2CH.6.23	then may you yourself hear from the heavens and act and judge your servants, to repay the guilty by bringing his way upon his head and to vindicate the righteous by giving to him according to his righteousness. 
2CH.6.24	“And if your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against you and they repent and confess your name and pray and plead before you in this house, 
2CH.6.25	then may you yourself hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your people Israel and again bring them back to the land that you gave to them and to their ancestors.
2CH.6.26	“When the heavens are stopped up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you and they pray to this place and confess your name and turn back from their sin when you humble them, 
2CH.6.27	then may you yourself hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your servants and your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk, and give rain upon your land that you have given to your people as an inheritance. 
2CH.6.28	“If there is a famine in the land; if there is disease, blight, mildew, locust, and caterpillar; if it happens that his enemy lays siege to him in the land and his gates; any kind of plague, any kind of disease, 
2CH.6.29	then any prayer, any plea that is made by any person and by all your people Israel, each one who knows his own affliction and his own anguish and who spreads out his hands to this house, 
2CH.6.30	then may you yourself hear from the heavens, your dwelling place, and forgive and give to each according to all his ways, since you know the heart of the children of humankind, 
2CH.6.31	that they may fear you and walk in your ways all the days that they are alive upon the face of the land that you have given to our ancestors.
2CH.6.32	“And also, with respect to the foreigner, he who is not of your people Israel, but comes from a distant land, for the sake of your great name and your powerful hand and outstretched arm, when he comes and prays to this house, 
2CH.6.33	then may you yourself hear from the heavens, from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner asks of you, so that all peoples of earth will know of your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that your name possesses
2CH.6.34	“When your people go out to battle against their enemy according to the way that you have sent them, and they pray to you toward this city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name, 
2CH.6.35	then may you hear their prayer and their pleas from the heavens and uphold their case. 
2CH.6.36	When they sin against you—for there is no person who does not sin—and you become angry with them and place them before their enemy that they carry them away as captives to a land far or near, 
2CH.6.37	but if they repent
2CH.6.38	and we return to you,’ with their whole heart and with all their inmost being in the land of their captivity where they took them captive, and if they pray toward their land that you have given to their ancestors
2CH.6.39	then may you hear their prayer and their pleas from the heavens, from your dwelling place, and uphold their case and forgive your people who sinned against you. 
2CH.6.40	Now, O my God, please let your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayer of this place! 
2CH.6.41	“And now arise, O Yahweh God, to your resting place, you and the ark of your strength! O Yahweh God, let the priests be clothed with salvation, and let your holy ones rejoice in your goodness! 
2CH.6.42	O Yahweh God, do not turn away the face of your anointed one! Remember the loyal love of your servant, David!” 
2CH.7.1	And when Solomon finished praying, then fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of Yahweh filled the house. 
2CH.7.2	And the priests were not able to go into the house of Yahweh, for the glory of Yahweh had filled the house. 
2CH.7.3	When all the Israelites
2CH.7.4	Then the king and all the people were offering a sacrifice before Yahweh. 
2CH.7.5	And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. 
2CH.7.6	And the priests stood at their posts with the Levites, with the instruments of the song of Yahweh that King David had made to give thanks to Yahweh—for his loyal love is everlasting—whenever David offered praise by their hand. Now the priests sounded trumpets standing opposite them, and all Israel stood. 
2CH.7.7	And Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard that was before the house of Yahweh, for there he had made the burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, for the bronze altar that Solomon had made was not able to hold the burnt offerings, cereal offerings, and the fat. 
2CH.7.8	And Solomon held
2CH.7.9	And on the eighth day they made a solemn assembly, for they held
2CH.7.10	And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents rejoicing and festive of heart on account of the goodness that Yahweh had done for David, Solomon, and Israel his people. 
2CH.7.11	And Solomon finished the house of Yahweh and the house of the king. And all that came into the heart of Solomon to do with respect to the house of Yahweh and his own house he accomplished. 
2CH.7.12	Then Yahweh appeared to Solomon at night and said to him, “I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice. 
2CH.7.13	When I hold back the heavens so that there is not rain, and when I command the locust to devour the earth, and if I send disease among my people, 
2CH.7.14	then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and will pray and will seek my face and will turn from their evil ways, then I myself shall hear from the heavens and will forgive their sins and heal their land. 
2CH.7.15	Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer of this place. 
2CH.7.16	And now I have chosen and consecrated this house for my name to be there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there for all time.
2CH.7.17	Now as for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked and do according to all that I have commanded you and will keep my ordinances and judgments, 
2CH.7.18	then I will establish the throne of your kingdom as I promised
2CH.7.19	“But if you turn yourselves away and forsake my ordinances and my commandments which I have given before you all and will go and serve other gods and bow down to them, 
2CH.7.20	then I will uproot them from upon my land that I have given to them, and this house that I have consecrated for my name I will send away from before my face, and I will make it a proverb and a taunt among all the nations. 
2CH.7.21	And as for this house, which was exalted, all who pass by it will be appalled and will say, ‘Why has Yahweh done thus to this land and to this house?’ 
2CH.7.22	Then they will say, ‘Because they forsook Yahweh, the God of their ancestors,
2CH.8.1	And it happened that at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the house of Yahweh and his own house, 
2CH.8.2	Solomon also built the cities that Huram
2CH.8.3	And Solomon went to Hamath-Zobah and laid siege upon it. 
2CH.8.4	And he built Tadmor in the desert, and he built all the storage cities in Hamath. 
2CH.8.5	He also built Upper Beth-Horon and Lower Beth-Horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars; 
2CH.8.6	Baalath and all the storage cities that belonged to Solomon; all the cities for chariots
2CH.8.7	All the people who remained from the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites who were not from Israel, 
2CH.8.8	from the descendants
2CH.8.9	But from the Israelites
2CH.8.10	And these were the commanders of the garrisons that belonged to King Solomon, two hundred and fifty who exercised authority over the people. 
2CH.8.11	And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the house of David, king of Israel, for those places to which the ark of Yahweh has come are holy. 
2CH.8.12	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh that he had built before the portico, 
2CH.8.13	as was the daily requirement,
2CH.8.14	And in accord with the ordinance of David his father he appointed working groups of priests for their service, Levites for their responsibilities for praise and cultic service before the priests according to the daily requirement,
2CH.8.15	And they did not turn aside from the commandment of the king concerning the priests and the Levites concerning anything, and concerning the treasury rooms. 
2CH.8.16	And Solomon accomplished all the work from the day the foundation stone was laid for the house of Yahweh until its completion, and the house of Yahweh was finished. 
2CH.8.17	Then Solomon went to Ezion-Geber, and to Elath, on the edge of the sea in the land of Edom. 
2CH.8.18	And Huram
2CH.9.1	Now the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, and she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with hard questions, with much wealth and camels, bearing spices and much gold and precious stones. And she came to Solomon and told him all that was on her mind.
2CH.9.2	And Solomon answered all her questions.
2CH.9.3	When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon and the house he had built, 
2CH.9.4	and the food of his table, and the position of his officers, the duty of his servants and their clothing, his cupbearers and their clothing, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of Yahweh, there was no longer any breath
2CH.9.5	And she said to the king, “The word which I heard in my land concerning your words and your wisdom is true, 
2CH.9.6	but I did not believe their words until I came and saw with my own eyes. And behold, half the greatness of your wisdom was not reported to me; you surpass the rumors that I had heard. 
2CH.9.7	Blessed are your men, and blessed are these your servants who stand before you regularly and hear your wisdom! 
2CH.9.8	Blessed be Yahweh your God who took delight in you, to put you on his throne as king for Yahweh your God! Because your God loved Israel, he established him forever and has put you over them as king to do justice and righteousness!” 
2CH.9.9	And she gave to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold and a very great amount of spices and precious stones. And there were no spices such as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. 
2CH.9.10	Moreover the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir brought algum wood and precious stones. 
2CH.9.11	And the king made steps for the house of Yahweh and the house of the king, and lyres and harps for the singers from the algum wood. And there was not seen anything like them before in the land of Judah. 
2CH.9.12	Now King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba every desired thing she asked, besides what she had brought to the king. Then she turned and went to her land, she and her servants. 
2CH.9.13	And it happened that the weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, 
2CH.9.14	besides the gold and silver the traders and merchants brought, and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought. 
2CH.9.15	And King Solomon made two hundred shields of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went into each shield. 
2CH.9.16	And he made three hundred small shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels went into each small shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. 
2CH.9.17	And the king made a large ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	And the throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to the throne. And there were armrests on each side.
2CH.9.19	And twelve lions were standing there on each of the six steps on each end.
2CH.9.20	And all the drinking vessels of King Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not valued as anything in the days of Solomon. 
2CH.9.21	For the ships of the king went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram.
2CH.9.22	Thus King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and wisdom. 
2CH.9.23	And all the kings of the earth sought the face of Solomon to hear his wisdom that God put in his heart. 
2CH.9.24	And each of them brought his gifts, objects of silver, objects of gold, cloaks, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, as an amount year by year. 
2CH.9.25	And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. And he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 
2CH.9.26	And he ruled over all the kings from the River
2CH.9.27	And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar as the sycamore trees that are in the Shephelah for abundance. 
2CH.9.28	And the horses were imported from Egypt and from all lands for Solomon. 
2CH.9.29	As for the remainder of the words of Solomon from the first to the last, are they not written in the chronicles
2CH.9.30	And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 
2CH.9.31	And Solomon slept with his ancestors,
2CH.10.1	Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 
2CH.10.2	And it happened that when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it—now he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon—Jeroboam returned from Egypt. 
2CH.10.3	And they sent and called him. Then Jeroboam and all Israel went, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying, 
2CH.10.4	“Your father made our yoke heavy. Now, therefore, lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve you.” 
2CH.10.5	And he said to them, “In three days return to me again.” And the people went away. 
2CH.10.6	Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the elders who had been serving
2CH.10.7	And they said to him, “If you will be good to this people and please them, then speak good words to them. Then they will be your servants forever.”
2CH.10.8	But he forsook the advice of the elders that advised him and took counsel of the young men who had grown up with him who were serving
2CH.10.9	And he said to them, “What do you advise that we should say in return to this people, who said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father has put upon us’?” 
2CH.10.10	Then the young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus you should say to this people who have said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, so you yourself should lighten it for us.’ Thus you should say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than the loins of my father. 
2CH.10.11	So now, my father laid upon you a heavy yoke, but I myself will add to the yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I myself will do so with scorpions.’ ” 
2CH.10.12	Then Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had spoken, saying, “Return to me on the third day.” 
2CH.10.13	And the king answered them harshly, and King Rehoboam forsook the advice of the elders. 
2CH.10.14	And he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “I will make your yoke heavy, and I myself will add to it. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will do so with scorpions.” 
2CH.10.15	So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turning of events from God, so that Yahweh might fulfill his word that he had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat. 
2CH.10.16	So all Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, and the people answered the king, saying, “What portion is there for us in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Each to your tents, O Israel! Now look to your own house, David!” And all Israel went to their own tents. 
2CH.10.17	But as for the Israelites
2CH.10.18	Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of
2CH.10.19	So Israel has rebelled against the house of David until this day. 
2CH.11.1	When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred and eighty thousand chosen warriors,
2CH.11.2	But the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, the man of God, saying, 
2CH.11.3	“Say to Rehoboam, son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, 
2CH.11.4	‘Thus says Yahweh: “Do not go up, and do not fight against your brothers. Return, each man to his house, for this matter has come from me.” ’ ” So they obeyed the words of Yahweh and turned back from going against Jeroboam. 
2CH.11.5	And Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built cities as strongholds in Judah. 
2CH.11.6	He built Bethlehem, Etah, Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	Beth-Zur, Socoh, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, fortified cities that are in Judah and in Benjamin. 
2CH.11.11	And he strengthened the fortifications and put commanders in them, along with stores of food, olive oil, and wine. 
2CH.11.12	And in all the cities he put shields and spears, and he greatly strengthened them. So he had Judah and Benjamin. 
2CH.11.13	Now the priests and the Levites who were throughout all Israel took their stand with him
2CH.11.14	For the Levites left their pasturelands and their property and came to Judah and to Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them from serving as priests to Yahweh. 
2CH.11.15	And he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat idols and for the bull calves that he had made. 
2CH.11.16	Then after them, from all the tribes of Israel, those who set their heart to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to offer to Yahweh, the God of their ancestors.
2CH.11.17	And they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and made Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, secure for three years, for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years. 
2CH.11.18	Then Rehoboam took to himself as a wife Mahalath, the daughter
2CH.11.19	And she bore to him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom, who bore to him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 
2CH.11.21	And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines (for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and he fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters). 
2CH.11.22	And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as chief and crown prince over his brothers, in order to make him king. 
2CH.11.23	And he dealt wisely and distributed some of his sons throughout all the land of Judah and Benjamin, through all the fortified cities, and gave abundant provisions to them and obtained many wives for them. 
2CH.12.1	And when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and when he was strengthened, he forsook the law of Yahweh, and all Israel with him. 
2CH.12.2	And it happened that in the fifth year of King Rehoboam (for they had acted unfaithfully against Yahweh), Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem 
2CH.12.3	with one thousand two hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. And there was no number to the people who came up with him from Egypt—Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites. 
2CH.12.4	And he took the fortified cities that belonged to Judah, and he came up to Jerusalem. 
2CH.12.5	Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem from before Shishak. And he said to them, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘You yourselves have abandoned me, and I myself have surely abandoned you into the hand of Shishak.’ ” 
2CH.12.6	Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “Yahweh is righteous.” 
2CH.12.7	And when Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy. I will give to them some way of escape, that my anger not be poured out against Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. 
2CH.12.8	However, they shall be his servants, that they might know my service and the service of the kingdoms of other countries.” 
2CH.12.9	Then Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and he took the treasures out of the house of Yahweh and the treasures out of the king’s house. He took everything. He also took the small shields of gold that Solomon had made. 
2CH.12.10	And King Rehoboam made small shields of bronze in their place and committed them into the hand of the commanders of the guards who were keeping the entrance of the house of the king. 
2CH.12.11	And whenever the king went into the house of Yahweh, the guards came and carried them, and then they returned them to the alcove of the guards. 
2CH.12.12	And when he humbled himself, the anger of Yahweh was turned away from him, so that he did not destroy the city completely. Moreover, matters were well in Judah. 
2CH.12.13	So King Rehoboam was strengthened in Jerusalem, and he reigned there. Now, Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city where Yahweh had chosen to put his name out of all the tribes of Israel. And the name of his mother was Naamah the Ammonite. 
2CH.12.14	And he did evil, for he did not set his heart to seek Yahweh. 
2CH.12.15	Now the words of Rehoboam from the first to the last, are they not written in the chronicles
2CH.12.16	And Rehoboam slept with his ancestors,
2CH.13.1	In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah reigned over Judah. 
2CH.13.2	He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. 
2CH.13.2	Now there was war between Abijah and between Jeroboam. 
2CH.13.3	And Abijah joined in the battle with an army of four hundred thousand battle-hardened warriors,
2CH.13.4	Then Abijah stood up on top of Mount Zemaraim that is in the hill country of Ephraim and said, “Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel! 
2CH.13.5	Do you not all know that Yahweh the God of Israel gave the kingdom to David over Israel forever, to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? 
2CH.13.6	But Jeroboam the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master, 
2CH.13.7	and worthless men, sons of wickedness,
2CH.13.8	So now you yourselves are considering that you are strong before the kingdom of Yahweh which is in the hand the sons of David, since you yourselves are a great multitude and you have bull calves of gold that Jeroboam has made for idols. 
2CH.13.9	Did you not drive out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, the Levites? Have you not made for yourselves priests like all the peoples of the lands? All who come to be consecrated for priestly service
2CH.13.10	But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken him. The priests serving Yahweh are the sons of Aaron, the Levites, according to their service. 
2CH.13.11	They offer burnt offerings to Yahweh every morning
2CH.13.12	And look, God is with us at the head, and his priests have the trumpets for sounding blasts against you, O sons of Israel. Do not fight against Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,
2CH.13.13	Then Jeroboam sent around an ambush to come behind them. So they were in front of Judah, but the ambush was behind them. 
2CH.13.14	When Judah turned, then behold, the battle against them was in front and behind, and they cried to Yahweh, and the priests blew on the trumpets. 
2CH.13.15	Then the men of Judah shouted, and it happened that when the men of Judah were shouting, then God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
2CH.13.16	And the Israelites
2CH.13.17	And Abijah and his people struck a great blow against them, and the dead from Israel that fell were five hundred thousand chosen men. 
2CH.13.18	And the Israelites
2CH.13.19	And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam and took cities from him: Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages. 
2CH.13.20	And Jeroboam did not regain strength again in the days of Abijah. And Yahweh plagued him and he died. 
2CH.13.21	But Abijah became strong, and he took to himself fourteen wives and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. 
2CH.13.22	Now the rest of the words of Abijah and his ways and his words are written in the story of the prophet Iddo. 
2CH.14.1	 And Abijah slept with his ancestors,
2CH.14.2	Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Yahweh his God. 
2CH.14.3	He removed the foreign altars and high places, broke down the stone pillars, and cut down the Asherahs. 
2CH.14.4	And he commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their ancestors,
2CH.14.5	And he removed the high places and the incense stands from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom had rest under
2CH.14.6	And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land was at rest. Under
2CH.14.7	And he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and surround them with walls, towers, gates, and bars while the land is before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God. We have sought and he has given rest to us on every side.” So they built and had success. 
2CH.14.8	And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah, bearing shields and spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand from Benjamin who carried shields and drew bows. All of these were mighty warriors of strength. 
2CH.14.9	Zerah the Cushite came out against them with an army of a thousand thousands and three hundred chariots. And he came to Mareshah. 
2CH.14.10	And Asa went out before him, and a battle was put in order in the valley of Zepah at Mareshah. 
2CH.14.11	Then Asa cried out to Yahweh his God. And he said, “O Yahweh, there is none with you to help between the great and the powerless. Help us, O Yahweh our God, for we rely upon you, and in your name we have come against this multitude. O Yahweh, you are our God! Let no man prevail against you!” 
2CH.14.12	So Yahweh defeated the Cushites before Asa and before Judah, and the Cushites fled. 
2CH.14.13	Then Asa and the army
2CH.14.14	And they struck all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of Yahweh was upon them. And they plundered all the cities, for there was much plunder in them. 
2CH.14.15	And they also struck the tents of the herdsmen and carried away many sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem. 
2CH.15.1	Now Azariah the son of Oded—the Spirit of God came upon him. 
2CH.15.2	And he went out before Asa and said to him, “Hear me, O Asa and all of Judah and Benjamin! Yahweh is with you while you are with him. And if you will seek him he will be found by you. But if you forsake him he will forsake you. 
2CH.15.3	Now Israel has been without the true God many days, and without a teaching priest, and without law, 
2CH.15.4	but at its trouble he returned to Yahweh, the God of Israel. They sought him, and he was found by them. 
2CH.15.5	And in those times there was no peace for the one going out and the one coming in, for great tumults were upon all the inhabitants of the lands. 
2CH.15.6	Nation was crushed by nation, and city was against city, for God threw them into confusion by all sorts of trouble. 
2CH.15.7	But as for you, be strong and let not your hands be weak, for there is reward for your labor.” 
2CH.15.8	And when Asa heard these words, the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage and removed the vile idols from all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, and from the cities that he had taken in the hill country of Ephraim, and he repaired the altar of Yahweh that was in front of the portico of Yahweh. 
2CH.15.9	And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin and those sojourning with them, from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, for many had deserted to him from Israel when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him. 
2CH.15.10	And they were gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 
2CH.15.11	And they sacrificed to Yahweh on that day from the war booty they brought back: seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep. 
2CH.15.12	And they entered into a covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of their ancestors,
2CH.15.13	but all who will not seek Yahweh the God of Israel should be killed, from young to old, from men to women. 
2CH.15.14	And they took an oath to Yahweh with a great voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with horns. 
2CH.15.15	And all Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they swore with all their heart. And they sought him with their whole desire, and he was found by them, and Yahweh gave rest to them all around. 
2CH.15.16	And also Maacah, the mother of Asa, the king removed her from being queen, because she had made a repulsive image for Asherah. And Asa cut down her repulsive image, and he crushed and burned it at the Wadi
2CH.15.17	But the high places were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was fully devoted all his days. 
2CH.15.18	And he brought the holy objects of his father and his own holy objects into the house of God—silver and gold and vessels. 
2CH.15.19	And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa. 
2CH.16.1	In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha the king of Israel went up against Judah. And he built Ramah in order not to allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa, king of Judah. 
2CH.16.2	Then Asa brought out silver and gold from the storehouses of the house of Yahweh and the house of the king, and he sent them to Ben-Hadad, king of Aram,
2CH.16.3	“There is a covenant between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Look, I am sending you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha, king of Israel, that he might withdraw from me.” 
2CH.16.4	And Ben-Hadad listened to King Asa, and he sent commanders of his troops that were with him against the cities of Israel. And they struck Ijon, Dan, Abel-Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali. 
2CH.16.5	And it happened that when Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work. 
2CH.16.6	Then King Asa took all of Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had been building, and he built Geba and Mizpah with them. 
2CH.16.7	And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, “On account of your reliance upon the king of Aram,
2CH.16.8	Were not the Cushites and Libyans a mighty army with very abundant chariots and horsemen? And because of your reliance on Yahweh he gave them into your hand. 
2CH.16.9	For the eyes of Yahweh roam throughout all the earth to strengthen those whose heart is fully devoted to him. You have been foolish in this, for from now on you will have wars.” 
2CH.16.10	Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in the prison,
2CH.16.11	Now behold, the words of Asa from the first to the last, behold, they are written in the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.16.12	And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, he fell severely
2CH.16.13	And Asa slept with his ancestors.
2CH.16.14	And they buried him in his burial site, which had been cut out for him in the city of David. And they laid him on the bier which they had filled with all kinds of spices made by the perfumers as a fragment ointment. And they made a great fire in his honor. 
2CH.17.1	And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and he strengthened himself against Israel. 
2CH.17.2	And he put troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had taken. 
2CH.17.3	And Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways of David his father and did not seek after the Baals, 
2CH.17.4	but he sought after the God of his ancestors
2CH.17.5	So Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand. And all Judah gave tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had much wealth and honor. 
2CH.17.6	And his heart was courageous in the ways of Yahweh. Moreover, he removed the high places and the Asherahs from Judah. 
2CH.17.7	In the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; 
2CH.17.8	and with them the Levites Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah; and with them the priests Elisham and Joram. 
2CH.17.9	And they taught in Judah, and the scroll of the law of Yahweh was with them when they went around in all the cities of Judah, and they taught the people. 
2CH.17.10	And the fear of Yahweh was upon all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, and they did not make war against Jehoshaphat. 
2CH.17.11	And some of the Philistines brought a gift and silver to Jehoshaphat as tribute. The Arabians also brought him seven thousand seven hundred sheep and seven thousand seven hundred goats. 
2CH.17.12	And Jehoshaphat grew greater and greater,
2CH.17.13	And he had many supplies in the cities of Judah and mighty warriors for battle in Jerusalem. 
2CH.17.14	Now these were their enrollment by the house of their ancestors:
2CH.17.15	and at his side,
2CH.17.16	and at his side,
2CH.17.17	And from Benjamin: Eliada, a powerful mighty warrior, and with him were two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield; 
2CH.17.18	and at his side,
2CH.17.19	These were serving the king, besides those whom the king had placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah. 
2CH.18.1	Now Jehoshaphat had much wealth and honor, and he became son-in-law to Ahab. 
2CH.18.2	And after some years
2CH.18.3	And Ahab the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, “Will you go up with me to Ramoth-Gilead?” And he answered him, “I am as you are, and my people are as your people with you in war.” 
2CH.18.4	Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Seek first of all
2CH.18.5	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets, four hundred men. And he said to them, “Shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall we cease?” And they said, “Go up, since God will give it into the hand of the king.” 
2CH.18.6	Then Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not here another prophet of Yahweh that we might inquire of him?” 
2CH.18.7	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom to seek Yahweh, but I hate him, because he never prophesies good concerning me, but always
2CH.18.8	Then the king of Israel called to a eunuch and said, “Quickly bring Micaiah the son of Imlah.” 
2CH.18.9	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were each sitting on his throne, clothed in robes. And they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them. 
2CH.18.10	And Zedekiah the son of Kenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and he said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘With these you will gore Aram
2CH.18.11	And all the prophets prophesied thus, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-Gilead and triumph! Yahweh will give it into the hand of the king.” 
2CH.18.12	Then the messenger who went to call Micaiah said to him, “Behold, the words of the prophets are good with one voice to the king. Please let your word be as one with them and speak good.” 
2CH.18.13	But Micaiah said, “As Yahweh lives, only what my God has said, that will I speak.” 
2CH.18.14	And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to war or shall I cease?” And he said, “Go up and triumph! They shall be given into your hand.” 
2CH.18.15	But the king said to him, “How many times shall I make you swear that you speak nothing except the truth in the name of Yahweh?” 
2CH.18.16	Then he said, “I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains like sheep that had no shepherd. And Yahweh said, ‘These have no masters; let them return to his own house in peace.’ ” 
2CH.18.17	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not say to you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but only disaster?” 
2CH.18.18	Then Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh sitting upon his throne with all the host of heaven standing on his right and on his left. 
2CH.18.19	And Yahweh said, ‘Who will entice Ahab the king of Israel that he would go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead?’ And one said this, and another said that. 
2CH.18.20	Then a spirit came forth and stood before Yahweh and said, ‘I will entice him.’ Then Yahweh said to him, ‘By what means?’ 
2CH.18.21	Then he said, ‘I will go forth and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And he said, ‘You will entice him and will also succeed. Go out and do so.’ 
2CH.18.22	So now, behold, Yahweh has put a spirit of deception into the mouths of these your prophets. Yahweh has spoken disaster against you.” 
2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah the son of Kenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, “Which way
2CH.18.24	Then Micaiah said, “Behold, you will see on that day when you go into a private room to hide yourself.” 
2CH.18.25	Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the commander of the city and to Jehoash the son of the king, 
2CH.18.26	and say, ‘Thus says the king: “Put this one into the prison house, and let him eat a meager ration of bread and water
2CH.18.27	And Micaiah said, “If you surely return in peace Yahweh has not spoken with me.” Then he said, “Hear, peoples, all of them!” 
2CH.18.28	Then the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-Gilead. 
2CH.18.29	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you, wear your garments.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went to war. 
2CH.18.30	Now the king of Aram
2CH.18.31	And it happened that when the commanders of the chariots
2CH.18.32	And it happened that when the commanders of the chariots
2CH.18.33	Now a certain man drew the bow at random
2CH.18.34	And the battle went on that day, and the king of Israel was propped up in the chariot facing Aram
2CH.19.1	Then Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. 
2CH.19.2	And Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him. And he said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you be a help to the wicked and love those who hate Yahweh? On account of this, wrath has come against you from Yahweh. 
2CH.19.3	Nevertheless some good things have been found in regard to you, for you burned the Asherahs out of the land and set your heart to seek God.” 
2CH.19.4	And Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and returned and went out among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to Yahweh, the God of their ancestors.
2CH.19.5	And he appointed judges in the land and in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city. 
2CH.19.6	And he said to the judges, “Consider what you are doing, for you are not judging for a man but for Yahweh. Now he is with you in speaking justice. 
2CH.19.7	So now, let the fear of Yahweh be upon you all. Be careful what you do,
2CH.19.8	Moreover, Jehoshaphat appointed in Jerusalem some of the Levites and the priests and heads of the families
2CH.19.9	And he commanded them, saying, “Thus you must do in the fear of Yahweh in faithfulness and with a whole heart. 
2CH.19.10	Any legal dispute that comes before you from your brothers who live in their cities concerning bloodguilt, law, commandment, statutes, and justice, you must warn them, so that they do not incur guilt before Yahweh, and that wrath may not come upon you and your brothers. Thus you must do that you do not incur guilt. 
2CH.19.11	And behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the word of Yahweh, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the governor of the house of Judah, in all matters of the king, and the Levites shall be before you as officials. Be strong and do well! May Yahweh be with the upright.” 
2CH.20.1	And it happened that afterward, the Moabites,
2CH.20.2	And they came and reported it to Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude from beyond the sea, from Aram,
2CH.20.3	Then Jehoshaphat was afraid and set his face to seek Yahweh. And he called for a fast through all Judah. 
2CH.20.4	And Judah assembled to seek after Yahweh; even from all the cities of Judah they came to seek Yahweh. 
2CH.20.5	Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of Yahweh before the new courtyard. 
2CH.20.6	And he said, “O Yahweh, God of our ancestors,
2CH.20.7	O, our God, did you yourself not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it to the descendants
2CH.20.8	And they lived in it and built for you a sanctuary for your name in it, saying, 
2CH.20.9	‘If disaster, a sword, punishment, disease, or famine come upon us, we shall stand before this house and before you—for your name is in this house—and cry out to you out of our trouble, then you will hear and save us.’ 
2CH.20.10	And now, look, the people
2CH.20.11	now behold, they are rewarding us by coming to dispossess us from your possession which you gave us as an inheritance. 
2CH.20.12	O our God, will you not judge them, for there is no power in us before this great multitude that is coming against us. Now we do not know what we shall do, for our eyes are upon you.” 
2CH.20.13	And all Judah was standing before Yahweh, and also their little children, their wives, and their children. 
2CH.20.14	Then the Spirit of Yahweh came upon Jahaziel, the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite from the descendants
2CH.20.15	And he said, “Listen, all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat, thus says Yahweh to you: ‘Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed before this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God’s. 
2CH.20.16	Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they are coming up the ascent of Ziz. And you will find them at the end of the valley facing the desert of Jeruel. 
2CH.20.17	There will be no need for you to fight in this battle. Take your stand! Stand and see the deliverance of Yahweh among you, O Judah and Jerusalem! Do not fear and do not be dismayed. Tomorrow go out before them and Yahweh will be with you.’ ” 
2CH.20.18	Then Jehoshaphat bowed his face
2CH.20.19	Then the Levites, from the Kohathites
2CH.20.20	And they rose up early in the morning and went out to the desert of Tekoa. And when they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Hear me, O Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in Yahweh your God, and you shall be established! Believe in his prophets, and you shall succeed!” 
2CH.20.21	And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed singers to Yahweh who were giving praise to the splendor of his holiness when they went out before the army. And they said, “Give thanks to Yahweh, for his loyal love is everlasting!” 
2CH.20.22	And when
2CH.20.23	when the people
2CH.20.24	And Judah came against the watchtower of the wilderness. And they looked at the crowd, and behold, corpses were lying on the ground. There was none who had escaped. 
2CH.20.25	When Jehoshaphat came with his people to plunder their booty, they found among them in abundance possessions, corpses, and precious items. And they took plunder for themselves until they could carry no more.
2CH.20.26	And on the fourth day, they assembled in the Valley of Berakah, for there they blessed Yahweh. Therefore the name of that place is called the Valley of Berakah up to this day. 
2CH.20.27	And all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned, and Jehoshaphat was at their head in returning to Jerusalem with joy, for Yahweh caused them to rejoice over their enemies. 
2CH.20.28	And they came to Jerusalem with harps, stringed instruments, and trumpets to the house of Yahweh. 
2CH.20.29	And the fear of God came upon all the kingdoms of the earth when they heard that Yahweh had fought against the enemies of Israel. 
2CH.20.30	So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at rest, since his God gave rest to him all around. 
2CH.20.31	So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign. And he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi. 
2CH.20.32	And he walked in the way of his father Asa and did not turn aside from it, to do what was right in the eyes of Yahweh. 
2CH.20.33	Only the high places were not removed. The people still had not yet set their heart on the God of their ancestors.
2CH.20.34	Now the rest of the words of Jehoshaphat, from the first to the last, behold, they are written in the chronicles
2CH.20.35	And afterward Jehoshaphat the king of Judah joined with Ahaziah the king of Israel, who acted wickedly. 
2CH.20.36	He joined with him to build ships to go to Tarshish. And they built the ships in Ezion Geber. 
2CH.20.37	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because of your joining with Ahaziah, Yahweh will break down your works.” And the ships were destroyed and were not able to go to Tarshish. 
2CH.21.1	And Jehoshaphat slept with his ancestors
2CH.21.2	Now he had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were the sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel. 
2CH.21.3	And their father gave to them many gifts of silver, gold, and valuables, with fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, for he was the firstborn. 
2CH.21.4	When Jehoram ascended to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself and murdered all his brothers with the sword, and even some of the princes of Israel. 
2CH.21.5	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.21.6	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did evil in the sight of Yahweh. 
2CH.21.7	But Yahweh was not willing to destroy the house of David on account of the covenant that he had made
2CH.21.8	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and they set up a king of their own. 
2CH.21.9	Then Jehoram passed over with his commanders and all the chariots with him, and when night came he struck Edom who was all around him and the commanders of his chariots. 
2CH.21.10	So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah until this day. Then Libnah also revolted at that time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Yahweh, the God of his ancestors.
2CH.21.11	Moreover, he made high places in the hill country of Judah, and he enticed the inhabitants of Jerusalem to be unfaithful, and he led Judah astray. 
2CH.21.12	And a letter from Elijah the prophet came to him, saying, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father: ‘Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father or in the ways of Asa, the king of Judah, 
2CH.21.13	but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel and have enticed Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to be unfaithful like the unfaithfulness of the house of Ahab, and have also murdered your brothers of the house of your father who were better than you, 
2CH.21.14	behold, Yahweh is inflicting a great plague on your people, your children, your wives, and all your possessions, 
2CH.21.15	and you yourself will be afflicted with great illness, with sickness in your bowels, until your bowels come out on account of the illness, day by day.’ ” 
2CH.21.16	And Yahweh stirred up the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabs who were near
2CH.21.17	And they came up against Judah and invaded it and carried away all the possessions found in the house of the king, and also his sons and his wives, so that no son was left to him except Jehoahaz his youngest son. 
2CH.21.18	And after all this Yahweh afflicted him in his bowels with an illness for which there was no cure. 
2CH.21.19	And it happened that after many days, at the end of two years,
2CH.21.20	He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he departed
2CH.22.1	And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place, for the band of men who had come with the Arabs to the camp had murdered all the older sons. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, reigned. 
2CH.22.2	Ahaziah was forty-two
2CH.22.3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor for doing wickedness. 
2CH.22.4	And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh as the house of Ahab had done, for they were his counselors to his destruction after the death of his father. 
2CH.22.5	He also walked in their counsel and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, to war against Hazael king of Aram
2CH.22.6	And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds he had suffered at Ramah, when he made war against Hazael king of Aram.
2CH.22.7	But the downfall of Ahaziah was from God, and intended to come to Joram. And when he came, he went out with Jehoram to Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab. 
2CH.22.8	And it happened that when Jehu was judging the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah who ministered to Ahaziah, and he killed them. 
2CH.22.9	And he searched for Ahaziah and captured him. And he was hiding in Samaria. And they brought him to Jehu and put him to death. And they buried him, for they said, “He is the descendant
2CH.22.10	Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and murdered all the royal descendants
2CH.22.11	But Jehosheba the daughter of the king took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, and kidnapped him away from the sons of the king who were to be put to death. And she put him and his nurse in a private bedroom. So Jehosheba the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, because she was a sister of Ahaziah, hid him from before Athaliah so that she did not put him to death. 
2CH.22.12	And he was hidden with them in the house of God six years, but Athaliah reigned over the land. 
2CH.23.1	And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself and took with him into a covenant relationship the commanders of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zicri. 
2CH.23.2	And they went around in Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the families
2CH.23.3	And all the assembly made
2CH.23.4	This is the thing that you must do: one third of you priests and Levites coming off duty on the Sabbath
2CH.23.5	and one third at the house of the king, and one third at the Gate of the Foundation. And all the people shall be in the courtyards of the house of Yahweh. 
2CH.23.6	Let no one enter into the house of Yahweh except the priests and the ministering Levites. They themselves may enter, for they are holy, but all the people shall keep the requirements of Yahweh. 
2CH.23.7	And the Levites shall surround the king all around, each with his weapons in his hand. And whoever comes into the house shall be put to death. You shall be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.” 
2CH.23.8	And the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And they each took his men who were coming off duty on the Sabbath
2CH.23.9	And Jehoiada the priest gave the spears and small shields that had belonged to King David that were in the house of God to the commanders of hundreds. 
2CH.23.10	And he appointed all the people, each with his weapon in his hand from the south side of the house to the north side of the house around the altar and the house. 
2CH.23.11	Then they brought out the son of the king and set upon him the crown and gave him the statute and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said, “Long live the king!”
2CH.23.12	When Athaliah heard the sound of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people at the house of Yahweh. 
2CH.23.13	And she looked and, behold, the king was standing by his column at the entrance, and the commanders and trumpeters beside the king, along with all the people of the land, rejoicing and blowing with trumpets, and the singers with the instruments of song leading the praise. And Athaliah tore her garments and cried, “Conspiracy! Conspiracy!” 
2CH.23.14	Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the commanders of the hundreds appointed over the troops, and he said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks, and whoever goes after her shall be put to death with the sword.” For the priest had said, “You must not kill her in the house of Yahweh.” 
2CH.23.15	And they laid hands on her, and she went into the entrance of the Horse Gate of the house of the king, and they killed her there. 
2CH.23.16	And Jehoiada made
2CH.23.17	Then all the people went to the house of Baal and broke it down. And they smashed his altars and his images, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. 
2CH.23.18	And Jehoiada placed appointees at the house of Yahweh under the hand of the Levitical priests whom David had allotted to the house of Yahweh to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh as was written in the law of Moses, with joy and with song, according to the order of David.
2CH.23.19	And he set the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of Yahweh so that no person unclean with respect to any matter could enter. 
2CH.23.20	And he took the commanders of hundreds, the noblemen, the governors over the people, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of Yahweh. And they came through the upper gate to the house of the king, and they set the king upon the throne of the kingdom. 
2CH.23.21	So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been killed with the sword. 
2CH.24.1	Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Zibiah from Beersheba. 
2CH.24.2	And Joash did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priest. 
2CH.24.3	And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
2CH.24.4	And afterward it was in the heart of Joash to repair the house of Yahweh. 
2CH.24.5	So he gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah and gather money from all Israel to strengthen the house of your God sufficiently year by year. Now you yourselves must hasten to the matter.” But the Levites did not act with haste. 
2CH.24.6	So the king called Jehoiada the chief, and he said to him, “Why have you not required the Levites to bring from Judah and Jerusalem the tax of Moses, the servant of Yahweh, and of the assembly of Israel for the tent of the testimony?” 
2CH.24.7	For the sons of the wicked Athaliah had broken into the house of God and had used all the holy vessels of the house of Yahweh for the Baals. 
2CH.24.8	Then the king commanded, and they made a chest and put it at the gate outside the house of Yahweh. 
2CH.24.9	And they issued a proclamation
2CH.24.10	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and they brought their tax and threw it into the chest until it was finished. 
2CH.24.11	And whenever he brought the chest to the appointee of the king by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money in it, then the secretary of the king and the officer of the chief priest came and emptied the chest, then they took it and returned it to its place. Thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance. 
2CH.24.12	And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of Yahweh. And they hired stonemasons and skilled craftsmen to restore the house of Yahweh, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of Yahweh. 
2CH.24.13	So those doing the work labored, and the restoration for the work made progress under their hand. And they restored the house of God to its position and strengthened it. 
2CH.24.14	And when they had finished, they brought the remainder of the money before the king and Jehoiada, and they used it for objects for the house of Yahweh, objects for the service and the burnt offerings, dishes, and objects of gold and silver. And they were offering burnt offerings in the house of Yahweh regularly, all the days of Jehoiada. 
2CH.24.15	And Jehoiada grew old and full of days, and he died; he was one hundred and thirty years old at his death. 
2CH.24.16	And they buried him in the city of David with the kings, for he did good in Israel and with respect to God and his house. 
2CH.24.17	Now after the death of Jehoiada, the princes of Judah came and bowed down to the king. Then the king listened to them. 
2CH.24.18	And they forsook the house of Yahweh, the God of their ancestors
2CH.24.19	But he sent prophets among them, to bring them back to Yahweh. And they testified against them, and they did not obey. 
2CH.24.20	Then the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, and he stood above the people and said to them, “Thus says God: ‘Why are you transgressing the commandments of Yahweh so that you will not succeed? For you have forsaken Yahweh, so he will forsake you.’ ” 
2CH.24.21	Then they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the command of the king in the courtyard of the house of Yahweh. 
2CH.24.22	So King Joash did not remember the loyal love that Jehoiada had shown to him, and he killed his son. And as he was dying he said, “May Yahweh see and avenge!” 
2CH.24.23	And it happened at the turn of the year that the army of Aram
2CH.24.24	Though the army of Aram
2CH.24.25	And when they were going away from him (for they had left him with many wounds), his servants conspired against him on account of the blood of the sons
2CH.24.26	Now these are the ones who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath, the Ammonite, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith, the Moabite. 
2CH.24.27	And as for his sons, the many oracles against him, and his repair of the foundation of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the scroll of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his place. 
2CH.25.1	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king. And he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother was Jehoaddan from Jerusalem. 
2CH.25.2	And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, only not with a fully-devoted heart. 
2CH.25.3	And it happened that as his reign was strengthened, he killed his servants who had killed his father the king. 
2CH.25.4	But he did not put their children to death, according to what is written in the law, in the scroll of Moses, where Yahweh commanded, saying, “Fathers shall not be put to death on account of the sons, and the sons shall not be put to death on account of the fathers, but each shall be put to death for his own sin.” 
2CH.25.5	Then Amaziah assembled the men of Judah and set them by families
2CH.25.6	And he hired from Israel one hundred thousand strong, mighty warriors for one hundred talents. 
2CH.25.7	But a man of God came to him, saying, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for Yahweh is not with Israel, all the Ephraimites. 
2CH.25.8	But even still, you yourself go, do! Be strong for the battle else God will make you stumble before the enemy! For there is power with God to help and to cause stumbling.” 
2CH.25.9	And Amaziah said to the man of God, “Now what should I do with the one hundred talents that I have given to the troops of Israel?” And the man of God said, “Yahweh is able to give
2CH.25.10	Then Amaziah dismissed the troops that came to him from Ephraim to go to their home.
2CH.25.11	Then Amaziah strengthened himself, and leading his army, he went to the Valley of Salt. And he struck down ten thousand men
2CH.25.12	Now the troops
2CH.25.13	As for the troops
2CH.25.14	And it happened that after Amaziah came back from killing the Edomites, he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, and he stood them up to himself as gods and bowed down before them and make smoke offerings for them. 
2CH.25.15	So Yahweh became very angry
2CH.25.16	And it happened that while he was speaking to him, he said to him, “Have we appointed you as a counselor to the king? Stop—why should you be killed?”
2CH.25.17	Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel, and he sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come,
2CH.25.18	And Joash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thorn bush that is in Lebanon has sent to the cedar which is in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife.’ But a wild animal of the field that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thorn bush. 
2CH.25.19	Look, you say that you have struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up to boast. Now remain at your home. Why stir up disaster that you fall, you and Judah with you?” 
2CH.25.20	But Amaziah did not listen, for it was from God that he might give them into the hand of enemies, because they sought the gods of Edom. 
2CH.25.21	So Joash the king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah the king of Judah faced one another
2CH.25.22	And Judah was defeated before Israel, and each man fled to his tent. 
2CH.25.23	And Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah the king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-Shemesh. And they brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, four hundred cubits. 
2CH.25.24	Then with all the gold and silver, all the objects found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, the storehouses of the house of the king, and the hostages,
2CH.25.25	And Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel, fifteen years. 
2CH.25.26	Now the remainder of the words of Amaziah, from the first to the last, behold, are they not written in the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel? 
2CH.25.27	And from the time that Amaziah turned away from Yahweh, they had plotted a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. And he fled to Lachish, but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there. 
2CH.25.28	And they carried him on the horses and buried him with his ancestors
2CH.26.1	Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah (now he was sixteen years old) and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah. 
2CH.26.2	He built Elath and returned it to Judah after the king slept with his ancestors.
2CH.26.3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. And the name of his mother was Yecoliah of Jerusalem. 
2CH.26.4	And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that Amaziah his father had done. 
2CH.26.5	And he began to seek
2CH.26.6	And he went out and made war against the Philistines, and he broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod, and he built cities in Ashdod and among the Philistines. 
2CH.26.7	And God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabs who were living in Gur-Baal and Meunim. 
2CH.26.8	And the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah, and his fame
2CH.26.9	And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the Angle, and he strengthened them. 
2CH.26.10	And he built towers in the desert and hewed many cisterns, for he had much livestock, both in the Shephelah and on the plain, along with farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil. 
2CH.26.11	And Uzziah had troops trained and ready for war
2CH.26.12	The whole number of the heads of the families
2CH.26.13	And under their hand were army troops numbering three hundred and seven thousand five hundred who could make war with power and strength to help the king against an enemy. 
2CH.26.14	And Uzziah prepared small shields, spears, helmets, breastplates, bows, and slingstones for the whole army. 
2CH.26.15	And he made siege machines in Jerusalem designed by skillful men to be set upon the towers and upon the corners to shoot arrows and large slingstones. And his fame
2CH.26.16	But on account of his strength his heart grew proud unto destruction. And he acted unfaithfully against Yahweh his God and went into the temple of Yahweh to offer an incense offering on the altar. 
2CH.26.17	And Azariah the priest, along with eighty strong priests with him, went in after him. 
2CH.26.18	And they stood against King Uzziah and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh, but it is for the priests, the descendants
2CH.26.19	Then Uzziah, his censer in hand to burn incense, became angry. And when he became angry with the priests, then leprosy appeared on his forehead in front of the priests in the house of Yahweh at the altar of incense. 
2CH.26.20	When Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned to him, behold, he was leprous in the forehead. So they rushed him away from there, and he also hastened to go out, for Yahweh had smitten him. 
2CH.26.21	So King Uzziah was leprous until the day of his death, and he lived in a separate house as a leper, for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh. And Jotham his son was over the house of the king, judging the people of the land. 
2CH.26.22	Now the remainder of the words of Uzziah, from the first to the last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote them. 
2CH.26.23	And Uzziah slept with his ancestors,
2CH.27.1	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok. 
2CH.27.2	And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Uzziah had done—only he did not go into the temple of Yahweh. But the people still acted corruptly. 
2CH.27.3	He built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and he did much restoration
2CH.27.4	And he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and he built forts and towers in the wooded places. 
2CH.27.5	Now he fought with the king of the Ammonites
2CH.27.6	And Jotham strengthened himself, for he established his ways before Yahweh his God. 
2CH.27.7	Now the remainder of the words of Jotham and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written upon the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
2CH.27.8	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.27.9	And Jotham slept with his ancestors,
2CH.28.1	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what is right in the eyes of Yahweh like David his ancestor.
2CH.28.2	But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and also made molten idols for the Baals. 
2CH.28.3	And he himself burned incense in the valley of Ben-Hinnom and burned his sons in the fire, according to the detestable practices of the nations whom Yahweh drove out before the Israelites. 
2CH.28.4	And he sacrificed and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops, and under every flourishing tree. 
2CH.28.5	Then Yahweh his God gave him into the hand of the king of Aram
2CH.28.6	And Pekah, the son of Remaliah, killed in one day one hundred and twenty thousand in Judah, all men of strength, because they forsook Yahweh the God of their ancestors.
2CH.28.7	And Zikri, a mighty warrior of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the son of the king, Azrikam the commander of the house, and Elkanah the second to the king. 
2CH.28.8	And the Israelites captured two hundred thousand of their brothers, women, sons, and daughters. And they also plundered much booty from them and brought the booty to Samaria. 
2CH.28.9	Now a prophet of Yahweh was there; Oded was his name. And he went out before the army that was coming to Samaria and said to them, “Look, it is on account of the anger of Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,
2CH.28.10	So now, you yourselves plan to subdue people of Judah and Jerusalem as slaves and female servants for yourselves. Is there not also guilt on your part
2CH.28.11	So now, listen to me and return the captives of your brothers whom you have taken captive, for the fierce anger of Yahweh is against you.” 
2CH.28.12	Then men from the heads of Ephraim—Azariah the son of Jehohanan, Berekiah the son of Meshillemoth, Hezekiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai—stood against those returning from the fight. 
2CH.28.13	And they said to them, “You shall not bring the captives here, for it is as guilt against Yahweh upon us. You yourselves plan to add to our sins and to our guilt, but our guilt is very great, and there is great anger against Israel.” 
2CH.28.14	So the soldiers left the captives and the plunder before the commanders and all the assembly. 
2CH.28.15	Then the men designated by name arose and took the captives and from the plunder clothed all their nakedness. So they clothed them, gave them sandals, gave them food to eat, gave them water to drink, anointed them, and guided them with the donkeys provided for all those who stumbled, and brought them to Jericho, the city of the palm trees, next to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria. 
2CH.28.16	At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria to help him, 
2CH.28.17	since again the Edomites came and struck against Judah and took captives. 
2CH.28.18	And the Philistines sent raids into the cities of the Shephelah and the Negeb of Judah. And they captured Beth-Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Socoh with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages. And they settled there. 
2CH.28.19	For Yahweh subdued Judah for the sake of Ahaz, king of Israel, for he created disorder in Judah and acted unfaithfully against Yahweh. 
2CH.28.20	Then Tiglath-Pileser
2CH.28.21	for Ahaz took a portion from the house of Yahweh and the house of the king and the princes, and he gave it to the king of Assyria, but it was no help to him. 
2CH.28.22	And in the time of his distress, King Ahaz continued to act unfaithfully against Yahweh. 
2CH.28.23	He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him and said, “Because the gods of the king of Aram
2CH.28.24	Then Ahaz gathered the objects of the house of God, and he cut the objects of the house of God to pieces. And he shut the doors of the house of Yahweh and made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem. 
2CH.28.25	And in every city
2CH.28.26	Now the remainder of his words and all his ways, from the first to the last, behold, they are written upon the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.28.27	And Ahaz slept with his ancestors,
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah. 
2CH.29.2	And he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father had done. 
2CH.29.3	In the first year of his kingship, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of Yahweh and strengthened them. 
2CH.29.4	And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and he gathered them into the eastern square. 
2CH.29.5	And he said to them, “Hear me, O Levites! Sanctify yourselves now, and sanctify the house of Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,
2CH.29.6	For our ancestors
2CH.29.7	They also shut the doors of the portico and extinguished the lamps. And they did not burn incense or offer burnt offerings in the sanctuary to the God of Israel. 
2CH.29.8	And the wrath of Yahweh was upon Judah and Jerusalem. And he made them as an abhorrence, as a desolation and an object of scorn, as you see with your own eyes. 
2CH.29.9	Now behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity on account of this. 
2CH.29.10	Now it is in my heart
2CH.29.11	Now, my sons, do not be negligent, for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him to serve him and to be his servants and incense burners.” 
2CH.29.12	Then the Levites arose—Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, from the Kohathites; and Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel from the Merarites; and Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah, from the Gershonites. 
2CH.29.13	And from the descendants
2CH.29.14	and from the descendants
2CH.29.15	and they gathered their brothers and sanctified themselves, and they went in according to the command of the king because of the words of Yahweh, to purify the house of Yahweh. 
2CH.29.16	And the priests went into the inner part of the house of Yahweh to purify it. And they brought out all the impurity that they found in the temple of Yahweh out to the courtyard of the house of Yahweh. And the Levites took them to bring them outside to the Wadi
2CH.29.17	And they began to sanctify themselves on the first day of the first month. And on the eighth day of the month they came to the portico of Yahweh. And they sanctified the house of Yahweh for eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished. 
2CH.29.18	And they went into the inner part to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed all the house of Yahweh: the altar of burnt offering, all its objects, the table of the rows of bread and all its objects, 
2CH.29.19	and all the objects that King Ahaz discarded in his reign when he sinned, we have prepared and sanctified. Look, they are before the altar of Yahweh.” 
2CH.29.20	Then King Hezekiah rose early and gathered the officials of the city, and he went up to the house of Yahweh. 
2CH.29.21	And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a purification offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the descendants
2CH.29.22	And they slaughtered the cattle, and the priests received the blood and threw it toward the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams and threw the blood toward the altar, and then they slaughtered the lambs and threw the blood toward the altar. 
2CH.29.23	Then they brought the goats of the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid hands upon them. 
2CH.29.24	And the priest killed them and offered their blood against the altar to make atonement for all Israel, for the king had commanded the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel. 
2CH.29.25	And he stood the Levites in the house of Yahweh with cymbals, harps, and lyres, according to the command of David and Gad, the seer of the king, and Nathan the prophet, for the command was by the hand of Yahweh by the hand of his prophets. 
2CH.29.26	When the Levites stood with the objects of David and the priests with the trumpets, 
2CH.29.27	Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And at the time the burnt offering began, the song of Yahweh began, and also the trumpets, at the hands of the instruments of David king of Israel. 
2CH.29.28	Then all the assembly bowed down, and the song was sung, and the trumpeters trumpeted—all together until the end of the burnt offering. 
2CH.29.29	And when the offering was finished, the king and all who were found with him knelt down and bowed themselves. 
2CH.29.30	Then King Hezekiah and the princes commanded the Levites to praise Yahweh with the words of David and Asaph the seer. So they offered praise with joy, and they bowed down and worshiped. 
2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah answered and said, “Now you have consecrated yourselves
2CH.29.32	And the number of burnt offerings that the assembly brought was seventy cattle, one hundred rams, two hundred lambs—all these were to offer to Yahweh. 
2CH.29.33	And the consecrated offerings of cattle were six hundred cattle and three thousand sheep. 
2CH.29.34	But the priests were too few, and they were not able to offer all the burnt offerings, so their brothers, the Levites, strengthened them to finish the work, and until the rest of the priests consecrated themselves. (For the Levites were more conscientious
2CH.29.35	And beside the many burnt offerings was the fat of the peace offerings and the libations for the burnt offerings. So the service of the house of Yahweh was established. 
2CH.29.36	And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over what God had established with the people, for the matter happened suddenly. 
2CH.30.1	Then Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, to come to the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem to make a Passover feast to Yahweh the God of Israel. 
2CH.30.2	Now the king and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to make the Passover feast in the second month—
2CH.30.3	but they were not able to make it at that time, for the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient numbers,
2CH.30.4	and the plan seemed right in the eyes of the king and in the eyes of all the assembly. 
2CH.30.5	So they let the decree stand, to make a proclamation
2CH.30.6	And the runners went with the letter from the hand of the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah according to the command of the king, saying, “O sons of Israel, return to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may turn again to the remnant of you who escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria. 
2CH.30.7	Do not be like your fathers and like your brothers, who acted unfaithfully before Yahweh, the God of their ancestors,
2CH.30.8	Now, do not stiffen your neck as your fathers,
2CH.30.9	For when you return to Yahweh, your brothers and your children will find compassion before their captors and return to this land, for Yahweh your God is gracious and compassionate, and he will not turn away his face from you if you return to him.” 
2CH.30.10	And it happened that the runners were passing from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and up to Zebulun, but they were laughing at them and mocking them. 
2CH.30.11	Only men from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.12	The hand of God was also upon Judah, to give them one heart to obey the command of the king and the princes concerning the word of Yahweh. 
2CH.30.13	So many people gathered in Jerusalem to hold the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month; it was a very great assembly. 
2CH.30.14	And they rose up and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem. And they removed all the incense altars and threw them away in the Wadi
2CH.30.15	And they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were disgraced, so they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of Yahweh. 
2CH.30.16	Then they stood at their positions according to custom, according to the law of Moses the man of God. The priests were sprinkling the blood from the hand of the Levites. 
2CH.30.17	For there were many in the assembly who did not consecrate themselves, so the Levites were over the killing of the Passover sacrifices for all who were not clean, to consecrate them to Yahweh. 
2CH.30.18	For a majority of the people, many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves. But they ate the Passover sacrifice otherwise than prescribed,
2CH.30.19	everyone whose heart is set to seek God, Yahweh the God of his ancestors,
2CH.30.20	And Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and he healed the people. 
2CH.30.21	And the Israelites
2CH.30.22	And Hezekiah spoke to the heart of all the Levites who were skilled at service
2CH.30.23	Then the whole assembly decided to make seven more days of feasting, so they made seven more days with joy, 
2CH.30.24	for Hezekiah the king of Judah had provided
2CH.30.25	And the whole assembly of Judah, the priests and the Levites, all the assembly who had come from the land of Israel, and those living in Judah rejoiced. 
2CH.30.26	And there was great joy in Jerusalem, for from the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there was nothing such as this in Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.27	Then the priests and the Levites arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came to his holy dwelling place in the heavens. 
2CH.31.1	And when all this was finished, all Israel who were found in the cities of Judah went out and shattered the stone pillars, cut down the Asherahs, and destroyed the high places and the altars from all Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh to the very last one.
2CH.31.2	And Hezekiah appointed working groups of the priests and the Levites, each according to their divisions, according to the service for priests and Levites,
2CH.31.3	And the gift of the king was out of his own possessions for the burnt offerings—the burnt offerings for the morning and the evening and for Sabbaths, new moon festivals, and appointed feasts, as is written in the law of Yahweh. 
2CH.31.4	Then he said to the people, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to give a gift for the priests and the Levites, so that they might be strong in the law of Yahweh. 
2CH.31.5	And the word spread. The Israelites gave abundantly from the firstfruits of grain, new wine, olive oil, honey, and all kinds of grains from the field. And they brought tithes of everything in abundance. 
2CH.31.6	Then the people of Israel and Judah who were living in the cities of Judah, they also brought a tithe of cattle and sheep and a tithe of consecrated objects to Yahweh their God. And they gave heaps upon heaps. 
2CH.31.7	In the third month the heaps began to pile up, and in the seventh month they ceased. 
2CH.31.8	When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Yahweh and his people Israel. 
2CH.31.9	And Hezekiah questioned
2CH.31.10	And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, saying, “Since the offerings began to be brought to the house of Yahweh, we have eaten and been satisfied, and have much to spare, for Yahweh has blessed his people. Now see this abundant remainder!” 
2CH.31.11	And Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Yahweh, and they were prepared. 
2CH.31.12	Then they brought the offerings and tithes and holy objects faithfully. And over them as leader was Conaniah the Levite. And Shimei his brother was second in rank. 
2CH.31.13	And Jehiel, Azaziah, Nathan, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were chief officers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei, his brother, by appointment of King Hezekiah. And Azaraiah was leader of the house of God. 
2CH.31.14	Now Kore the son of Imlah, the Levite, the gatekeeper of the east gate was over the freewill offerings of God, to give offerings to Yahweh and the most holy things. 
2CH.31.15	And at his hand were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah in the cities of the priests and entrusted
2CH.31.16	besides their enrollment by genealogy, to males from three years old and upward, to all who came into the house of Yahweh, as each day required
2CH.31.17	And the enrollment of the priests was according to the house of their fathers, and the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, according to their posts by their working groups. 
2CH.31.18	And they were enrolled with all their little ones, their wives, their sons, and their daughters for the whole assembly because of their faithfulness. And they sanctified themselves in holiness. 
2CH.31.19	And for the descendants
2CH.31.20	And Hezekiah did according to this throughout all Judah. And he did what is good and what is right and what is faithful before Yahweh his God. 
2CH.31.21	And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God or with respect to the law and the commandment to seek his God, he did with all his heart, and he prospered. 
2CH.32.1	After these things and these acts of faithfulness, Sennacherib the king of Assyria came, and he came against Judah. And he encamped against the fortified cities and planned to break them down for himself. 
2CH.32.2	When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that his face was set for battle against Jerusalem, 
2CH.32.3	he took counsel with his commanders and his mighty warriors to block off the waters of the springs that came from outside the city, and they helped him. 
2CH.32.4	Then many people were gathered, and they blocked off all the springs and the river that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?” 
2CH.32.5	Then he strengthened himself and built up all the walls that were broken down, and raised towers upon them and another wall outside.
2CH.32.6	And he appointed commanders for battle over the people and gathered them to himself into the public square of the gate of the city. And he spoke to their hearts, saying, 
2CH.32.7	“Be strong! Be courageous! Do not fear and do not be dismayed before the king of Assyria and before all the crowd that is with him, for there are more with us than with him. 
2CH.32.8	With him is the arm of flesh, and with us is Yahweh our God, to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people took confidence with the words of Hezekiah, king of Judah. 
2CH.32.9	After this Sennacherib the king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (now he and all his armies with him were against Lachish) to Hezekiah king of Judah and to all of Judah that was in Jerusalem, saying, 
2CH.32.10	“Thus says Sennacherib the king of Assyria: ‘On what are you relying that you are dwelling in siege works in Jerusalem? 
2CH.32.11	Is not Hezekiah urging you to give you up to die by starvation and thirst, saying, “Yahweh our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria”? 
2CH.32.12	Has not Hezekiah himself removed his high places and his altars and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying, “You must bow down before one altar and upon it you must make offerings”? 
2CH.32.13	Do you not know what I have done, I and my ancestors,
2CH.32.14	Who among all the gods of those nations whom my ancestors
2CH.32.15	So now, do not let Hezekiah deceive you. Do not let him urge you according to this. Do not put trust in him, for no god of any nation and kingdom has been able to save his people from my hand and from the hand of my ancestors.
2CH.32.16	And still more his servants said against Yahweh God and against Hezekiah his servant. 
2CH.32.17	And he wrote letters to treat Yahweh the God of Israel with contempt and spoke against him, saying, “As the gods of the nations of the earth who did not save their people from my hand, so likewise the God of Hezekiah will not save his people from my hand.” 
2CH.32.18	Then they called with a great voice in Judean to the people of Jerusalem who were upon the wall to frighten them and terrify them, so that they could take the city captive. 
2CH.32.19	And they spoke about the God of Jerusalem as about the gods of the peoples of the earth, the works of the hands of humankind. 
2CH.32.20	Then King Hezekiah and Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, prayed concerning this. And they cried to the heavens. 
2CH.32.21	Then Yahweh sent an angel, and he destroyed every mighty warrior of strength, commander, and officer in the camp of the king of Assyria. And he returned with shamed face to his land and went into the house of his god. And some of the offspring of his loins fell upon him there with the sword. 
2CH.32.22	So Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, and from the all their enemies, and gave them rest all around. 
2CH.32.23	And many brought tribute to Yahweh, to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations thereafter. 
2CH.32.24	In those days Hezekiah fell ill unto death, and he prayed to Yahweh. And he answered him and gave him a sign. 
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah did not reciprocate according to the benefit placed upon him, because his heart became proud. So wrath was upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.32.26	But Hezekiah humbled himself with respect to the arrogance of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Yahweh did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah. 
2CH.32.27	And Hezekiah had very much wealth and honor, and he made storehouses for himself for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, small shields, and all sorts of desirable objects; 
2CH.32.28	and storage buildings for the yield of grain, new wine, and olive oil; and animal stalls for all kinds of animals, and animals and herds for animal stalls. 
2CH.32.29	And he made cities for himself, and livestock of sheep and abundant cattle, for God had given to him very abundant possessions. 
2CH.32.30	And this same Hezekiah blocked off the flow of the waters of the upper Gihon, and directed them down the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. 
2CH.32.31	And thus in the matter of the envoys of the commanders of Babylon who had been sent to him to seek the sign that had happened in the land, God forsook him, to test him and to know all that was in his heart. 
2CH.32.32	Now the remainder of the words of Hezekiah and his loyal love, behold, they are written in the visions of Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, upon the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.32.33	And Hezekiah slept with his ancestors,
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.2	And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh according to the detestable things of the nations whom Yahweh drove out before the Israelites.
2CH.33.3	And he rebuilt
2CH.33.4	And he built altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh had said, “In Jerusalem my name shall be forever.” 
2CH.33.5	And he built altars to all the host of heaven in the two courtyards of the house of Yahweh. 
2CH.33.6	And he himself burned his sons in the fire in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom. And he practiced sorcery and divination, and he engaged in witchcraft and dealt with mediums and spiritists. And he did much evil in the eyes of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger. 
2CH.33.7	And he placed the carved image of the idol that he had made in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever. 
2CH.33.8	And I will never
2CH.33.9	And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do evil more than the nations that Yahweh destroyed before the Israelites.
2CH.33.10	And Yahweh spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they would not listen. 
2CH.33.11	So Yahweh brought the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria upon them, and they took Manasseh captive with hooks, and they bound him with bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon. 
2CH.33.12	And when he was in distress he entreated Yahweh his God and greatly humbled himself before the God of his ancestors
2CH.33.13	and prayed to him. And God responded to him and heard his plea and let him return to Jerusalem to his kingdom. And Manasseh knew that Yahweh was God. 
2CH.33.14	Then afterward he built an outer wall for the city of David west of the Gihon in the valley, and for the entrance into the Gate of the Fishes. And it encircled the Ophel and raised it very high. Then he placed strong commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah. 
2CH.33.15	And he removed the foreign gods and the carved image from the house of Yahweh and all the altars which he built on the mountain of the house of Yahweh and in Jerusalem, and he threw them outside the city. 
2CH.33.16	And he restored the altar of Yahweh and offered sacrifices of peace offerings and thank offerings upon it. And he commanded Judah to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
2CH.33.17	Nevertheless, the people offered at the high places, but only to Yahweh their God. 
2CH.33.18	Now the remainder of the words of Manasseh and his prayer to his God and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are in the words of the kings of Israel. 
2CH.33.19	And his prayer, and how he
2CH.33.20	And Manasseh slept with his ancestors,
2CH.33.21	Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.22	And he did what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh as Manasseh his father had done. And Amon sacrificed to all the idols that Manasseh his father had made, and he served them. 
2CH.33.23	And he did not humble himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father humbled himself, but Amon himself multiplied his guilt. 
2CH.33.24	And his servants conspired against him and killed him in his house. 
2CH.33.25	But the people of the land struck down all who conspired against King Amon. And the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place. 
2CH.34.1	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.2	And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and he walked in the ways of David his ancestor
2CH.34.3	In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still a boy, he began to seek the God of David his ancestor.
2CH.34.4	And he destroyed before him the altars for the Baals, and he cut down the incense stands above them. And the Asherahs, the idols, and the images he smashed. And he ground them to powder and sprinkled the dust over the burial sites of those who sacrificed to them. 
2CH.34.5	And he burned the bones of the priests on the altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.6	And in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, in their ruins all around, 
2CH.34.7	he broke down the altars and the Asherahs and crushed the idols, grinding them to dust, and he cut down all the incense stands in all the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.8	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign after he purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the commander of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of Yahweh his God. 
2CH.34.9	And they came to Hilkiah the high priest and gave the money that was brought for the house of God, which the Levites, the guardians of the threshold, had gathered from the hand of Manasseh, Ephraim, and from the whole remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.10	And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen who were appointed in the house of Yahweh, and they in turn gave it to those doing the work who were at work in the house of Yahweh, to repair and restore the house. 
2CH.34.11	And they dispensed
2CH.34.12	And the men did the work faithfully. Over them as supervisors were appointed Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites from the Merarites, and Zechariah and Meshullam from the Kohathites. And other Levites, all who were skilled in instruments of song, 
2CH.34.13	were over the porters and were directing all who worked on each task.
2CH.34.14	And when they brought out the money that had been brought to the house of Yahweh, Hilkiah the priest found a scroll of the law of Yahweh by the hand of Moses. 
2CH.34.15	And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found a scroll of the law in the house of Yahweh!” Then Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan. 
2CH.34.16	And Shaphan brought the scroll to the king and also informed
2CH.34.17	They have dispensed
2CH.34.18	Then Shaphan the scribe reported to the king, “Hilkiah the priest gave to me a scroll.” Then Shaphan read from it before the king. 
2CH.34.19	And when the king heard the words of the law, he tore his garments, 
2CH.34.20	and the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the servant of the king, saying, 
2CH.34.21	“Go! Seek Yahweh on my behalf and on behalf of those remaining in Israel and Judah concerning the words of the scroll that was found, for the anger of Yahweh that was poured out on us is great, because our ancestors
2CH.34.22	Then Hilkiah and those whom the king had sent went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, son of Tikvath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the garments. (Now she was living in Jerusalem in the second district.) And they spoke to her concerning this. 
2CH.34.23	And she said to them, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Say to the man who sent you all to me: 
2CH.34.24	“Thus says Yahweh: ‘Behold, I am bringing disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants—all the curses written in the scroll that were read before the king of Judah—
2CH.34.25	because they have abandoned me and burned incense to other gods so as to provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands. And my wrath will be poured out on this place and it will not be quenched.’ 
2CH.34.26	But to the king of Judah who sent you to seek Yahweh, thus shall you say to him: ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: As for the words which you heard, 
2CH.34.27	because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and against its inhabitants and you humbled yourself before me and tore your garments and wept before me, now I also have heard,’ declares
2CH.34.28	‘Behold, I will gather you to your ancestors,
2CH.34.29	Then they sent word to the king, and he gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.30	And the king went up to the house of Yahweh with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with the priests and the Levites—all the people from great to small—and they read in their ears all the words of the scroll of the covenant that was found in the house of Yahweh. 
2CH.34.31	And the king stood at his position. And he made the covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh and to keep his commands and statutes and regulations with all his heart and with all his soul, to do the words of the covenant that were written on this scroll. 
2CH.34.32	Then he obligated
2CH.34.33	And Josiah removed all the detestable things from the whole land that belonged to the Israelites
2CH.35.1	Josiah kept
2CH.35.2	And he set the priests at their posts and encouraged them in the service of the house of Yahweh. 
2CH.35.3	And he said to the Levites who were teaching all Israel, who were sanctified to Yahweh, “Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built. There is no need to carry it on your shoulders. Now serve Yahweh your God and his people Israel. 
2CH.35.4	And prepare yourselves according to your families,
2CH.35.5	And stand in the sanctuary according to the clans of your families
2CH.35.6	And slaughter the Passover lamb and consecrate yourself and prepare for your brothers to do according to the word of Yahweh by the hand of Moses. 
2CH.35.7	Then Josiah provided for the lay people
2CH.35.8	And his officials contributed a freewill offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, commanders of the house of God, gave to the priests two thousand six hundred Passover lambs and three hundred bulls. 
2CH.35.9	Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jehozabad, commanders of the Levites, contributed to the Levites five thousand Passover lambs and five hundred bulls. 
2CH.35.10	And when the work had been completed, the priests stood at their positions and the Levites in their working groups according to the command of the king. 
2CH.35.11	And they slaughtered the Passover lamb, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hand, and the Levites flayed the sacrifices. 
2CH.35.12	And they set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the clans of the families
2CH.35.13	Then they roasted the Passover lamb in the fire according to the ordinance. And they boiled the holy offerings in pots, in kettles, and in dishes and brought it quickly to the lay people.
2CH.35.14	And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, since the priests, the descendants
2CH.35.15	And the singers, the descendants
2CH.35.16	So all the service of Yahweh was prepared on that day to keep
2CH.35.17	And the Israelites who were present kept
2CH.35.18	And there was no Passover like it kept
2CH.35.19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.
2CH.35.20	After all of this that Josiah had prepared for the temple,
2CH.35.21	And he
2CH.35.22	But Josiah did not turn his face from him, but he disguised himself to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and he went out to fight in the plain of Megiddo. 
2CH.35.23	And the archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am badly wounded.” 
2CH.35.24	So his servants took him out of the chariot and transported him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died and was buried in the burial sites of his ancestors.
2CH.35.25	And Jeremiah uttered a lament for Josiah, and all the male and female singers have spoken in their laments about Josiah to this day. And they made them a requirement in Israel, and behold, they are written in the laments. 
2CH.35.26	Now the remainder of the words of Josiah and his loyal love for what is written in the law of Yahweh 
2CH.35.27	and his words, from the first to the last, behold, they are written in the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
2CH.36.1	And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and made him king in place of his father in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.2	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.3	Then the king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and laid a tribute upon the land of one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold. 
2CH.36.4	And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and he changed his name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Jehoahaz his brother and brought him to Egypt. 
2CH.36.5	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh his God. 
2CH.36.6	Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon went up against him, and he bound him with bronze fetters to bring him to Babylon. 
2CH.36.7	And Nebuchadnezzar brought to Babylon the objects of the house of Yahweh and put them into the temple in Babylon. 
2CH.36.8	Now the remainder of the words of Jehoiakim and the detestable things that he did and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place. 
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. 
2CH.36.10	And at the turn of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with objects of the treasure of the house of Yahweh. And he made Zedekiah his brother king in Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.11	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.12	And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh his God. He did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet who spoke for
2CH.36.13	And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God. He stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
2CH.36.14	All the leaders of the priests and the people likewise increased in unfaithfulness according to all the detestable things of the nations. And they polluted the house of Yahweh that he had consecrated in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.15	And Yahweh, the God of their ancestors,
2CH.36.16	But they were mocking the messengers of God and despising his words and scoffing at his prophets until the wrath of Yahweh rose against his people until there was no remedy. 
2CH.36.17	Therefore he brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, and he killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary. He showed no mercy on a young man, a virgin, the elderly, or decrepit. He delivered all into his hand. 
2CH.36.18	And all the vessels of the house of God, the great and the small, the storehouses of the house of Yahweh, and the storehouses of the king and his princes, these all he brought to Babylon. 
2CH.36.19	And they burned the house of God. And they shattered the walls of Jerusalem and burned its citadels with fire and destroyed all the vessels of its treasuries. 
2CH.36.20	And he took those who escaped the sword
2CH.36.21	to fulfill the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land has enjoyed its Sabbaths. All the days of desolation it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years. 
2CH.36.22	And in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation
2CH.36.23	“Thus says Cyrus, king of Persia: ‘Yahweh the God of heaven has given to me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has appointed me to build a house for him at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever is among you from all his people, may Yahweh his God go up with him.’ ” 
EZR.1.1	In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to accomplish the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah, Yahweh stirred the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia and he sent a message to all of his kingdom and also put the message in writing: 
EZR.1.2	“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: Yahweh, the God of the heavens, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. And he himself has appointed me to build a house for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. 
EZR.1.3	Whoever among you who is from all of his people, may his God be with him and may he go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and may he build the house of Yahweh, the God of Israel. He is the God who is in Jerusalem. 
EZR.1.4	And let every survivor, from wherever he resides
EZR.1.5	So the heads of the families
EZR.1.6	And all of their neighbors helped them
EZR.1.7	And Cyrus the king brought out the objects of the house of Yahweh that Nebuchadnezzar had brought from Jerusalem and placed in the house of his gods. 
EZR.1.8	Cyrus the king of Persia let them go out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and he counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah. 
EZR.1.9	Now these were the inventories: thirty gold metal dishes, one thousand silver metal dishes, twenty-nine vessels, 
EZR.1.10	thirty bowls of gold, four hundred and ten matching silver metal bowls, and one thousand other objects. 
EZR.1.11	All of the objects of gold and silver metal were five thousand four hundred. All this Sheshbazzar brought up along with the exiles from Babylonia to Jerusalem. 
EZR.2.1	Now these were the people
EZR.2.2	They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. 
EZR.2.2	The number of the men of the people of Israel:

EZR.2.55	The descendants
EZR.2.56	the descendants
EZR.2.57	the descendants
EZR.2.58	All the temple servants and the descendants
EZR.2.59	Now these were the ones who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, but they were not able to prove their fathers’ household and their descent, if they were from Israel: 
EZR.2.60	the descendants
EZR.2.61	And from the descendants
EZR.2.62	These sought their record in the genealogy records, but they were not found, and were excluded from the priesthood as unclean.
EZR.2.63	The governor said to them that they could not eat from the holy food of the sanctuary
EZR.2.64	The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty, 
EZR.2.65	apart from their male and female servants, of whom were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; and they had two hundred male and female singers. 
EZR.2.66	Their horses numbered seven hundred and thirty-six, their mules numbered two hundred and forty-five, 
EZR.2.67	their camels numbered four hundred and thirty-five, their donkeys numbered six thousand seven hundred and twenty. 
EZR.2.68	When some of the heads of families
EZR.2.69	According to their ability they gave to the treasury room for the work sixty-one thousand darics of gold, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly tunics. 
EZR.2.70	The priests, the Levites, and some of the people lived in Jerusalem, and the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities. 
EZR.3.1	Now the seventh month drew near and the Israelites
EZR.3.2	And Jeshua son of Jehozadak and his brothers the priests stood up, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers built the altar of the God of Israel, in order to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God. 
EZR.3.3	They set up the altar on its foundations, because they were in terror
EZR.3.4	And they kept the feast of booths, as it is written, and offered burnt offerings day by day in number according to the ordinance as described for each day.
EZR.3.5	After this, they presented the daily sacrifice of burnt offerings, the offerings for the New Moon Festival, and for all of the appointed times consecrated for Yahweh and for all who gave a freewill offering to Yahweh. 
EZR.3.6	From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh. But the temple of Yahweh was not yet founded. 
EZR.3.7	So they gave money to the stone craftsmen and skilled craftsmen, and food, drink, and olive oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the authorization over them of Cyrus king of Persia. 
EZR.3.8	In the second year after their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jehozadak began their work, and the remainder of their brothers the priests and the Levites and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem. They appointed the Levites from twenty years and older
EZR.3.9	And Jeshua with his sons and brothers, and Kadmiel and his sons—the sons of Judah—together directed the workers in the house of God, along with the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers the Levites. 
EZR.3.10	And the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Yahweh, and the priests in their apparel with the trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with the cymbals, were positioned to praise Yahweh, as described by
EZR.3.11	And they sang responsively,
EZR.3.11	And all of the people responded with a great shout of joyful acclaim in praise to Yahweh because the house of Yahweh was laid. 
EZR.3.12	But many of the elderly priests, Levites, and heads of the families who had seen the first temple, wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation of this house, but many shouted aloud with joy.
EZR.3.13	No person could distinguish the sound of joyful acclaim from the sound of people weeping, for the people shouted with great joyful acclaim and the sound was heard from afar. 
EZR.4.1	Now the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles
EZR.4.2	And they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the families,
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the families
EZR.4.4	Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah
EZR.4.5	and bribed officials against them to frustrate their plan for all the days of Cyrus king of Persia until the reign of Darius king of Persia. 
EZR.4.6	In the reign of Ahasuerus, at the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. 
EZR.4.7	And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their colleagues wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia. The letter was written in Aramaic and translated from Aramaic. 
EZR.4.8	Rehum the royal officer and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows 
EZR.4.9	(then Rehum the royal officer, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, the judges, the envoys, the officials, the Persians, the Erechs, the Babylonians, the Susians (that is the Elamites) 
EZR.4.10	and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and the rest of the province Beyond the River) and now 
EZR.4.11	this is the copy of the letter which they sent to him: 
EZR.4.11	“To King Artaxerxes from your servants, the men of the province Beyond the River. And now, 
EZR.4.12	be it known to the king that the Jews who have come up from near you to us have gone to Jerusalem. They are building the rebellious and wicked city. They are finishing the wall and repairing the foundation. 
EZR.4.13	Now be it known to the king that if this city is built and the walls are finished, they will not pay tribute and toll, and the royal revenue will be reduced. 
EZR.4.14	Now since we eat the salt of the palace and the dishonor of the king is not proper for us to see, we send and make this known to the king, 
EZR.4.15	so that it may be investigated in the book of records of your ancestors.
EZR.4.16	We make known to the king that if this city is built and the walls are finished, you will have nothing in the province Beyond the River.” 
EZR.4.17	The king sent a reply: “To Rehum the royal officer, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates who live in Samaria and the rest of the province Beyond the River, greetings. And now 
EZR.4.18	the letter that you sent to us has been translated and read before me. 
EZR.4.19	And I issued
EZR.4.20	Mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem, governing all the province Beyond the River, to whom tribute, duty, and tax has been given. 
EZR.4.21	So now, issue forth a decree that these men stop and this city not be built, until a decree is issued from me. 
EZR.4.22	And be careful not to be negligent on this matter. Why should damage grow to hurt kings?” 
EZR.4.23	Then when a copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their associates they returned in a hurry to Jerusalem against the Jews and they stopped them by force and power. 
EZR.4.24	Then the work on the house of God in Jerusalem stopped, and was discontinued until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia. 
EZR.5.1	Now the prophets, Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah
EZR.5.2	Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak set out and began to build the house of God that is in Jerusalem. And with them the prophets of God were helping them. 
EZR.5.3	At the same time Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their associates came to them and spoke to them thus: “Who issued you all a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?” 
EZR.5.4	Then we
EZR.5.5	And the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until the report came to Darius, and then answer was received. 
EZR.5.6	The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and his associates the envoys who were in the province Beyond the River sent to Darius the king. 
EZR.5.7	They sent to him the report in which was written as follows:
EZR.5.8	May it be known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, the house of the great God. It is being built with stone blocks and timber is being put in the walls. This work is being done with diligence and is making progress in their hands. 
EZR.5.9	Then we asked those elders and said this to them, ‘Who issued forth to you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?’ 
EZR.5.10	We also asked them their names to make them known to you, that we might write down the name of their leaders.
EZR.5.11	And this is the answer they returned to us: ‘We are servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are building the house that was built formerly many years ago, which a great king of Israel had built and finished. 
EZR.5.12	But because our ancestors
EZR.5.13	But in the first year of King Cyrus of Babylon’s reign he issued forth a decree to build this house of God. 
EZR.5.14	Also, the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took away from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple in Babylonia, King Cyrus removed them from the temple in Babylonia and they were given to Sheshbazzar, whom he appointed governor. 
EZR.5.15	He said to him, ‘Take these vessels. Go put them in the temple in Jerusalem and let the house of God be built on its site.’ 
EZR.5.16	Then this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of the house of God in Jerusalem. And from that time until now it is being built, but not yet finished.’ 
EZR.5.17	And now, if it seems good for the king, let it be investigated in the house of the treasury of the king in Babylonia to see if a decree was issued forth from King Cyrus to build this house of God in Jerusalem. And let the king send to us his desire on this matter.” 
EZR.6.1	Then King Darius issued forth a decree, and they searched the house of the treasury of scrolls being stored in Babylonia. 
EZR.6.2	But it was in Ecbatana in the province of Media, in the citadel, that a certain scroll had written on it, “A record. 
EZR.6.3	In the first year of King Cyrus, he issued forth a decree concerning the house of God in Jerusalem. Let the house be built, the place where sacrifices are offered and let its foundations be raised. Its height shall be sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits, 
EZR.6.4	with three layers of great stones and a layer of timber. Let the new expenses be paid from the house of the king. 
EZR.6.5	Also, let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylonia, be returned and brought to the temple in Jerusalem to its place. Put them in the house of God.” 
EZR.6.6	“Now then, Tattenai governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates, the envoys who are in the province Beyond the River—keep far away from there. 
EZR.6.7	Leave this work of the house of God alone. Let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site. 
EZR.6.8	And I issue forth a decree for what you should do for these elders of the Jews to build this house of God. The full expense will be paid to these men from the riches of the king from the taxes of the province Beyond the River, without delay. 
EZR.6.9	Whatever may be needed—young bulls,
EZR.6.10	that they may offer incense offerings to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and his children. 
EZR.6.11	Furthermore, I issue forth a decree that if any person violates this decree, let a beam be pulled out from his house and let him be impaled on it. And let his house be made a pile of rubble on account of this. 
EZR.6.12	May the God who has set his name there overthrow any king or people who sets his hand to alter or to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, issue forth a decree. Let it be done with diligence.” 
EZR.6.13	Then Tattenai the governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates consequently did with diligence what Darius the king ordered. 
EZR.6.14	So the elders of the Jews were building and prospering, through the prophecy of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo. They finished building by the command of the God of Israel and by the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and King Artaxerxes of Persia. 
EZR.6.15	This house was completed on the third day of the month of Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius. 
EZR.6.16	And the Israelites,
EZR.6.17	And they offered during the dedication of this house of God one hundred young bulls, two hundred young rams, four hundred lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering for Israel according to the number of the tribes of Israel. 
EZR.6.18	Then they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their sections for the work of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses. 
EZR.6.19	On the fourteenth day of the first month the returned exiles observed the Passover feast. 
EZR.6.20	For the priests and Levites together had consecrated themselves; all of them were clean. And they slaughtered the Passover sacrifice for all of the returned exiles, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves. 
EZR.6.21	The Israelites
EZR.6.22	With joy they celebrated the festival of unleavened bread for seven days, because Yahweh had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them in order to help them with the work of their hands on the house of the God of Israel. 
EZR.7.1	After these things during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah, 
EZR.7.2	son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub, 
EZR.7.3	son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth, 
EZR.7.4	, son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest— 
EZR.7.6	this Ezra went up from Babylonia. He was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses, which Yahweh the God of Israel gave. The king granted him all his requests, for the hand of Yahweh was upon him. 
EZR.7.7	Some of the Israelites,
EZR.7.8	He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. 
EZR.7.9	For on the first day of the first month he began the journey from Babylonia; and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, for the good hand of his God was on him. 
EZR.7.10	For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Yahweh, to do it, and to teach the regulations and judgments in Israel. 
EZR.7.11	This is the copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the scroll of the words of the commands of Yahweh and his statutes for Israel: 
EZR.7.12	“Artaxerxes, the king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of the heavens. Peace. And now 
EZR.7.13	I issue forth a decree that any of the people of Israel, their priests, or their Levites in my kingdom who are willing to go to Jerusalem may go with you. 
EZR.7.14	For you are sent from the king and his seven counselors to enquire about Judah and Jerusalem concerning the law of your God, which is in your hand. 
EZR.7.15	Also, bring the silver and gold that the king and his advisors have freely offered to the God of Israel whose dwelling is in Jerusalem, 
EZR.7.16	and all of the silver and gold that you will find in the whole province of Babylonia, with the freewill offerings of the people and the priests giving willingly for the house of their God in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.17	With this money, then, with diligence you must buy young bulls, young rams, lambs, and their offerings and libations. You must offer them on the altar that is in the house of your God in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.18	You may do whatever seems best to you and your brothers to do with the remainder of the silver and gold according to the desire of your God. 
EZR.7.19	And the vessels that were given to you for the service of the house of your God you shall deliver before the God of Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.20	And the remainder of the needs for the house of your God that falls to you to provide, you may provide from the house of the king’s treasury.” 
EZR.7.21	“I, even I, King Artaxerxes, issue forth a decree to all the treasurers who are in the province Beyond the River. Whatever the priest Ezra, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, may ask of you, let it be done with diligence, 
EZR.7.22	up to one hundred talents of silver, one hundred measures of wheat, one hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of oil, and unlimited salt.
EZR.7.23	All that is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done with diligence for the house of the God of heaven, otherwise wrath will come on the kingdom of the king and his sons. 
EZR.7.24	You also should be aware that it is not permitted to place tax, tribute, or duty upon all of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the doorkeepers, the temple servants, and other servants of the house of God. 
EZR.7.25	“You, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that you possess, appoint magistrates and judges who can judge all of the people in the province Beyond the River who know the laws of your God. And you will teach those who do not know. 
EZR.7.26	All who do not obey the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed on him with diligence, whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of goods and for imprisonment.” 
EZR.7.27	Blessed be Yahweh the God of our ancestors,
EZR.7.28	and who extended to me loyal love before the king and his counselors, and before all of the mighty officials of the king. I took courage, for the hand of Yahweh my God was upon me, and I gathered leaders from Israel to go up with me. 
EZR.8.1	These were the heads of their families
EZR.8.2	From the descendants
EZR.8.3	From the descendants
EZR.8.4	From the descendants
EZR.8.5	From the descendants
EZR.8.6	From the descendants
EZR.8.7	From the descendants
EZR.8.8	From the descendants
EZR.8.9	From the descendants
EZR.8.10	From the descendants
EZR.8.11	From the descendants
EZR.8.12	From the descendants
EZR.8.13	From the descendants
EZR.8.14	From the descendants
EZR.8.15	I gathered them by the river that goes to Ahava and we camped there for three days. And I looked at the people and the priests, I found no one there from the sons of Levi. 
EZR.8.16	And I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were family heads, and for Jehoiarib and Elnathan who were wise. 
EZR.8.17	I sent them to Iddo, the head of the place called Casiphia, and I placed in their mouths what words to say to Iddo and his brothers the temple servants in Casiphia, to send to us ministers for the house of our God. 
EZR.8.18	With the good hand of our God before us, they brought us a man of understanding from the sons of Mahli, son of Levi, son of Israel—Sherebiah and his sons and brothers, eighteen in total. 
EZR.8.19	Also Hashabiah and with him Jeshaiah, the sons of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, twenty in total. 
EZR.8.20	And from the temple servants, whom David and his officials had set up to serve the Levites, two hundred and twenty in total. All of them were registered by name. 
EZR.8.21	I proclaimed a fast there at the river Ahava to humble ourselves before our God in order to seek from him a safe journey for us, our children, and our possessions. 
EZR.8.22	For I was ashamed to ask the king for troops and horses to protect us from enemies on the way because we said to the king, “the hand of our God is favorable to all who seek him, but his strength and anger are against all who forsake them.” 
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and sought our God for this and he responded to our prayer. 
EZR.8.24	I set apart twelve of the official priests: Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them. 
EZR.8.25	Then I weighed out to them silver and gold and the vessels, the offering of the house of our God that the king, his counselors, his commanders, and all of Israel who was present offered. 
EZR.8.26	I weighed out into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, one hundred vessels of silver, one hundred talents of gold, 
EZR.8.27	twenty gold bowls worth one thousand darics, and two vessels of good polished bronze as precious as gold. 
EZR.8.28	And I said to them, “You are holy to Yahweh and the vessels are holy. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to Yahweh, God of your ancestors.
EZR.8.29	Guard and look after them until you weigh them before the chief priests, the Levites, and the heads of the families
EZR.8.30	So the priests and Levites took over the weighed silver, gold, and the vessels to bring to Jerusalem for the house of our God. 
EZR.8.31	On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the river of Ahava to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambushing on the way. 
EZR.8.32	We came to Jerusalem and remained there three days. 
EZR.8.33	On the fourth day, the silver, gold, and vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of priest Meremoth, the son of Uriah, and with him Eleazar son of Phinehas. With them were the Levites, Jehozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. 
EZR.8.34	The amount and weight of all the weighed items was recorded at that time. 
EZR.8.35	The exiles that returned from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel; twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve goats as a sin offering. All was a burnt offering to Yahweh. 
EZR.8.36	They delivered the customs of the king to the king’s satraps and to the governor of the province Beyond the River. And they supported the people of the house of God. 
EZR.9.1	After finishing these things the officials approached me saying, “The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated from the people of the lands with their detestable things, and from the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites. 
EZR.9.2	For they have taken from their daughters for themselves and their sons. So the holy seed has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands, and the hand of the officials and prefects were foremost in this sin. 
EZR.9.3	When I heard this I tore my garment and my robe, and I pulled the hair out from my head and beard, and I sat appalled. 
EZR.9.4	Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel because of the sin of the returned exiles were gathered around me and I sat appalled until the evening offering. 
EZR.9.5	At the evening offering I got up from my mourning posture and, with my garment and robe torn, I fell down on my knees and I spread out my palms to Yahweh my God 
EZR.9.6	and said, “My God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift my face to you, my God. For our sins have risen above our heads and our guilt has grown up to the heavens. 
EZR.9.7	From the days of our ancestors
EZR.9.8	But now for a brief moment mercy has been shown by Yahweh our God, who left behind for us a remnant, and given us security in his holy place—for our God to brighten our eyes and to give us brief relief in our bondage. 
EZR.9.9	For we are slaves and in our bondage our God did not forsake us, and he has extended to us loyal love in the presence of the kings of Persia, to give to us deliverance
EZR.9.10	“And now our God what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments, 
EZR.9.11	which you commanded by the hand of your servants the prophets saying, ‘The land that you are entering to possess is a land of impurity with the impurity of the peoples of the lands, with their detestable things which they have filled from end to end with their uncleanness. 
EZR.9.12	Therefore, do not give your daughters to their sons, and do not take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek their peace and prosperity so that forever you may be strong and eat the good of the land and may give it as an inheritance to your sons.’ 
EZR.9.13	After all that has come upon us for our evil practices and for our great guilt—you, our God, have held back less than our guilt deserved and you have given us a remainder such as this. 
EZR.9.14	Shall we again break your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who practice these detestable things? Would you not be angry with us until you destroy us with no remnant or remainder? 
EZR.9.15	Yahweh, God of Israel, you are righteous, for we have been left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, for none can stand before you because of this.” 
EZR.10.1	While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a very great assembly of men, women, and children from Israel gathered to him. And the people wept bitterly. 
EZR.10.2	Shecaniah son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, “We ourselves have broken faith with our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, and even now there is hope for Israel in spite of this. 
EZR.10.3	So now let us make a covenant with our God to send away all of these women and their offspring, according to the advice of my lord and those who tremble at the commandment of our God. Let it be done according to the law. 
EZR.10.4	Arise, for it is your task and we are with you. Be strong and do it.” 
EZR.10.5	Then Ezra stood up and made the chief priests, Levites, and all of Israel swear to do according to what was said. So they swore this oath. 
EZR.10.6	Ezra rose from before the house of God and went to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. He did not eat food nor drink water because he was mourning over the sin of the exiles. 
EZR.10.7	And they sent a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles
EZR.10.8	Anyone who did not come within three days, by decision of the officials and elders, all of his possessions would be devoted to God, and he himself would be excluded from the assembly of exiles. 
EZR.10.9	Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled in Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month on the twentieth day of the month. All the people sat in the public square of the house of God trembling because of this matter and from the rains. 
EZR.10.10	Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have broke faith and married foreign women, increasing the guilt of Israel. 
EZR.10.11	Now make a confession to Yahweh the God of your ancestors
EZR.10.12	Then all the assembly answered with a great voice and said, “It is so. We must do according to your words. 
EZR.10.13	But the people are many, and it is the time of rain; we are unable to stand outside. The task is not for one day or two, for we greatly rebelled in this matter. 
EZR.10.14	Please let our leaders stand for the whole assembly, and let all that are in our cities who have married foreign women come at set times, and with them the elders of and judges of each city, until the fierce wrath of our God because of this matter is averted from us.” 
EZR.10.15	Only Jehonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah stood against this, and the Levites Meshullam and Shabbethai supported them. 
EZR.10.16	The returned exiles
EZR.10.17	They finished investigating all the men who married foreign women by the first day of the first month. 
EZR.10.18	There was found from the sons of the priests those who had married foreign women, from the sons of Jeshua son of Jehozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah. 
EZR.10.19	They pledged themselves
EZR.10.20	From the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah. 
EZR.10.21	From the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah. 
EZR.10.22	From the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Eleasah. 
EZR.10.23	From the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (that is, Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer. 
EZR.10.24	From the singers: Eliashib. From the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri. 
EZR.10.25	And from Israel, the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malkijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malkijah, and Benaiah. 
EZR.10.26	From the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah. 
EZR.10.27	From the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza. 
EZR.10.28	From the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai. 
EZR.10.29	From the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth. 
EZR.10.30	From the sons of Pahath-Moab: Adna, Kelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh. 
EZR.10.31	From the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshiah, Malkijah, Shemaiah, Simeon, 
EZR.10.32	Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah. 
EZR.10.33	From the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei. 
EZR.10.34	From the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel, 
EZR.10.35	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Keluhi, 
EZR.10.36	Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, 
EZR.10.37	Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasu, 
EZR.10.38	Bani, Binnui, Shimei, 
EZR.10.39	Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah, 
EZR.10.40	Macnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, 
EZR.10.41	Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, 
EZR.10.42	Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph. 
EZR.10.43	From the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Iddo, Joel, and Benaiah. 
EZR.10.44	All of these had married foreign wives, and some from among the wives bore children. 
NEH.1.1	The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah. 
NEH.1.1	It happened in the month of Kislev, in the twentieth year, that I myself was in the citadel in Susa, 
NEH.1.2	and one of my brothers, Hanani, came with some men from Judah. I asked them about the Jews who had escaped the captivity and about Jerusalem. 
NEH.1.3	They replied to me, “The survivors in the province who have survived the captivity are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned in the fire.” 
NEH.1.4	When I heard these words, I sat and wept and mourned for days, and I was fasting and praying before the God of the heavens. 
NEH.1.5	I said, “O Yahweh God of the heavens, the great and awesome one who keeps the covenant and loyal love for the ones who love him and for those who keep his commands. 
NEH.1.6	Please, let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer of your servant that I am praying before you by day and by night for your servants, the Israelites,
NEH.1.7	We have certainly offended you and have not kept the commands, regulations, and judgments that you have commanded your servant Moses. 
NEH.1.8	Please, remember the word that you have commanded to your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you act unfaithfully I will scatter you all among the nations. 
NEH.1.9	But if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, even though all of your outcasts are at the furthest parts of heaven, I will gather them and bring them to the place which I have chosen to make my name dwell.’ 
NEH.1.10	They are your servants and your people whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand. 
NEH.1.11	O Lord, please let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight to revere in your name. Please, let your servant be successful this day and give him compassion before this man.” 
NEH.1.11	I was cupbearer for the king. 
NEH.2.1	It happened in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, I carried the wine and gave it to the king. And I had never been sad before the king. 
NEH.2.2	So the king said to me, “Why is your face sad since you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of the heart.” And I was very much afraid. 
NEH.2.3	I said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad when the city of my ancestors’
NEH.2.4	Then the king said to me, “What is your request?” So I prayed to the God of the heavens. 
NEH.2.5	Then I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your presence, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors’
NEH.2.6	With the queen sitting beside him, the king said to me, “How long will your journey be and when will you return?” So it pleased the king and he sent me, and I set for him an appointed time. 
NEH.2.7	Then I said to the king, “If it is good for the king, let letters be given to me for the governors in the province Beyond the River, that they may let me pass until I come to Judah. 
NEH.2.8	Also, a letter to Asaph, keeper of the king’s land reserve, that he should give me timber for laying the beams for the gates of the citadel of the house and for the walls of the city, and for the house which I will enter.” And the king gave permission to me, according to the good hand of God on me. 
NEH.2.9	I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and I gave them the letters of the king. Then the king sent troop commanders and horses with me. 
NEH.2.10	But when Sanballat the Horonite and the Ammonite servant Tobiah heard this, they were greatly displeased
NEH.2.11	I came to Jerusalem and was there for three days. 
NEH.2.12	I got up during the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anybody what my God put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. No animal was with me except the animal that I was riding on. 
NEH.2.13	I went out during the night at the gate of the valley by the Dragon spring and to the Dung Gate. And I examined the walls in Jerusalem and its gates that had been destroyed by the fire. 
NEH.2.14	I crossed over to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but there was no place for my mount
NEH.2.15	So I went up by the valley during the night and was examining the wall. Then I returned and came to the Valley Gate and returned. 
NEH.2.16	The prefects did not know where I had gone and what I was doing. I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the prefects, and the rest of the workers. 
NEH.2.17	Then I said to them, “You see the misery that we are in, that Jerusalem is ruined and its gates burned by the fire. Come, build the walls of Jerusalem and we shall no longer be a disgrace.” 
NEH.2.18	I told them of the good hand of my God that was upon me and surely the words of the king that were spoken to me. And they said, “Let us arise and build!” And they strengthened their hands for this good work. 
NEH.2.19	But Sanballat the Horonite, the Ammonite servant Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard it, and they mocked and despised us, saying, “What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?” 
NEH.2.20	Then I answered and said to them, “The God of the heavens himself will let us succeed, and we his servants shall arise and build. But for you there is no share, right, or memorial in Jerusalem.” 
NEH.3.1	Then Eliashib the high priest and his brothers the priests arose and rebuilt the Sheep Gate. They consecrated it and erected its doors. They consecrated it up to the Tower of the Hundred and up to the Tower of Hananel. 
NEH.3.2	And next to him
NEH.3.3	The sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate. They laid its beams and erected its doors, its bolts, and its bars. 
NEH.3.4	Next to them
NEH.3.5	Next to them
NEH.3.6	Jehoiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam repaired the old Yeshanah Gate. They laid its beams and erected its doors, its bolts, and its bars. 
NEH.3.7	Next to them
NEH.3.8	Next to him
NEH.3.9	Next to them
NEH.3.10	Next to them
NEH.3.11	Malkijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-Moab repaired another section and the Tower of the Ovens. 
NEH.3.12	Next to him
NEH.3.13	Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate. They rebuilt it and erected its doors, its bolts, and its bars, and a thousand cubits of the wall up to the Dung Gate. 
NEH.3.14	Malkijah son of Recab, commander of the district of Beth-haccherem, repaired the Dung Gate. He rebuilt it and erected its doors, its bolts, and its bars. 
NEH.3.15	Shallun son of Col-Hozeh, the commander of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate. He rebuilt it and covered it and erected its doors, its bolts, its bars, and he built the wall of the Pool of Shelah of the king’s garden, right up to the steps going down from the city of David. 
NEH.3.16	After him Nehemiah son of Azbuk, commander of half of the district of Beth Zur, repaired up to a point opposite the burial sites of David, and up to the artificial pool and to the house of the mighty warriors. 
NEH.3.17	After him the Levites repaired; Rehum son of Bani, and next to him Hashabiah, commander of half of the district of Keilah, repaired his district. 
NEH.3.18	After him their brothers repaired: Bavvai son of Henadad, commander of half of the district of Keilah, 
NEH.3.19	next to him
NEH.3.20	After him Baruch son of Zabbai zealously repaired a second section of a wall from the angle up to the doorway of the house of Eliashib the high priest. 
NEH.3.21	After him Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, repaired a second section of a wall from the doorway of the house of Eliashib up to the end of the house of Eliashib. 
NEH.3.22	After him the priests, men from the vicinity, repaired. 
NEH.3.23	After them Benjamin and Hasshub repaired opposite their house. After them Azariah son of Maaseiah, son of Ananiah, repaired beside his house. 
NEH.3.24	After him Binnui son of Henadad repaired a second section of a wall from the house of Azariah up to the angle up to the corner. 
NEH.3.25	Palal son of Uzai repaired opposite the Angle at the tower that juts out from the upper house of the king, at the courtyard of the guard. After him Pedaiah son of Parosh 
NEH.3.26	and the temple servants who were living on Ophel repaired up to opposite the Water Gate on the east and the projecting tower. 
NEH.3.27	After him the Tekoites repaired a second section of a wall opposite the projecting tower that goes out as far as the wall of Ophel. 
NEH.3.28	Above the Horse Gate the priests repaired, each one opposite his house. 
NEH.3.29	After them Zadok son of Immer repaired opposite his house. After him Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, keeper of the East Gate, repaired. 
NEH.3.30	After him Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph repaired another section. After him Meshullam son of Berekiah repaired the wall opposite his room. 
NEH.3.31	After him Malkijah, one of the goldsmiths,
NEH.3.32	Between the upper room of the corner to the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and merchants repaired. 
NEH.4.1	 Now it happened when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he became angry and greatly provoked, and he mocked the Jews. 
NEH.4.2	Then he said before his brothers and the army of Samaria, “What are the feeble Jews doing? Will they restore these things for themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish it in a day? Will they revive the stones from the piles of rubble—even those burned up?” 
NEH.4.3	Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him and said, “Their wall of stone that they are building would break down if a fox went on it!” 
NEH.4.4	Hear, our God, for we are despised. Turn their scorn on their head and give them over to plunder in the land of captivity. 
NEH.4.5	Do not cover their guilt, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before you. They have provoked the builders to anger.
NEH.4.6	So we rebuilt the wall, and all of the wall was joined up to half its height. For the people had a heart to do it. 
NEH.4.7	Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the restoration of the walls of Jerusalem were going forward and the gaps were being closed, they were very angry. 
NEH.4.8	So all of them plotted together to come fight against Jerusalem and to make trouble for it. 
NEH.4.9	So we prayed to our God and set up a guard against them day and night. 
NEH.4.10	But Judah said, “The strength of the carriers is failing, and there is too much dirt, and we are not able to build at the wall.” 
NEH.4.11	Then our enemies said, “They will not know nor see until we come upon them and will kill them and stop the work.” 
NEH.4.12	When the Jews who lived beside them came, they said to us ten times, “From all of the places where they live, they will come up against us.” 
NEH.4.13	I stationed the people behind the deepest part of the wall in the open places according to their families, with their swords, spears, and bows. 
NEH.4.14	And I looked, got up, and said to the nobles, prefects, and the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.” 
NEH.4.15	It happened when our enemies heard that their plan was known to us, that God had frustrated it, and we all returned to the wall—each to his work. 
NEH.4.16	From that day, half of my servants were working on craftsmanship, half were holding spears, small shields, bows, and breastplates. The commanders were behind the whole house of Judah. 
NEH.4.17	The ones who were building the wall and the ones who carried the materials
NEH.4.18	Each of the builders had his sword tied to his side while building. And the man who sounded the trumpet was beside me. 
NEH.4.19	I said to the nobles, to the prefects, and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and widespread, and we are spread out over the wall far from each other. 
NEH.4.20	Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, come together to us there. Our God will fight for us.” 
NEH.4.21	So we labored at the work, and half of them were holding the spears from dawn until the stars came out. 
NEH.4.22	At the time I also said to the people, “Let each man and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they will be a guard for us in the night and work in the day.” 
NEH.4.23	So neither I nor my brothers nor my young men nor the men of the guard who were behind me took off our clothes. Each one kept his weapon even in the water. 
NEH.5.1	Now there was a great cry of distress of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brothers. 
NEH.5.2	There were those who were saying, “Our sons and daughters, we are many. We must get grain so that we may eat and live.” 
NEH.5.3	There were also those saying, “We have pledged our fields and our vineyards and our houses so that we can get grain in the famine.” 
NEH.5.4	And there were those who were saying, “We have borrowed money on our fields and our vineyards for the tax of the king. 
NEH.5.5	Now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our sons are like their sons. Look, we are subduing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and there are some from our daughters being molested. We are powerless,
NEH.5.6	I was very angry when I heard their shouts and these words. 
NEH.5.7	I thought over this in my heart, and then I quarreled with the nobles and the prefects. I said to them, “You yourselves are taking interest from your own brother!” So I called the great assembly against them, 
NEH.5.8	and I said to them: “We ourselves have bought back our brothers the Jews who were sold to the nations as we were able. But now you yourselves have sold your brothers so they may be sold to us!” They were silent and could not find a word to say. 
NEH.5.9	So I said, “The thing that you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God to prevent the disgrace from the nations, our enemies? 
NEH.5.10	Also, I and my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Please stop taking this interest. 
NEH.5.11	Please restore to them this day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, their houses, and the interest on the money, the grain, the grape juice, and the olive oil that you have been taking from them.” 
NEH.5.12	So they said, “We will restore it and will not request anything more. So we will do as you say.” Then I called the priests and made them take an oath to do this promise. 
NEH.5.13	I also shook out my garment and said, “This is how God will shake out everyone from his house who will not keep this promise. So this is how his possessions will be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said, “Amen!” And they praised Yahweh, and the people kept this promise. 
NEH.5.14	Moreover, from the appointed day I was made their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes—twelve years. My brothers and I did not eat the food allowance of the governor. 
NEH.5.15	The former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people, and they took food and wine from them, besides forty shekels. Also, their servants controlled the people, but I did not do so because of the fear of God. 
NEH.5.16	I also devoted myself to the work of this wall, and we did not buy land. All of my servants were gathered for the work. 
NEH.5.17	One hundred and fifty men, prefects and Jews, and those who came to us from the nations around us, were at my table. 
NEH.5.18	Now what was prepared each day for me was one ox, six choice sheep, and birds. And every ten days all kinds of wine were made. But for this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor because the slavery was too heavy on this people. 
NEH.5.19	Remember me for good, my God, all that I have done for this people. 
NEH.6.1	Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and to the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall and that no gap was left in it—though up to that time I had not erected doors in the gates— 
NEH.6.2	Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come and let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they planned to do evil to me. 
NEH.6.3	So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and I am not able to come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you all?” 
NEH.6.4	And they sent a message to me four times like this, and I returned an answer like this to them. 
NEH.6.5	And Sanballat sent his servant with an open letter, another word like this to me a fifth time, in his hand. 
NEH.6.6	In it was written, “It has been reported among the nations, and Gashmu also is saying it, that you and the Jews are considering rebellion. Therefore, truly you are building the wall and you are becoming their king, according to these words. 
NEH.6.7	You have also set up prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, saying, ‘There is a king in Judah.’ And now it will be proclaimed to the king according to these words. Now, come and we will plan together.” 
NEH.6.8	So I sent to him saying, “None of these words you have spoken has happened. You are indeed saying things created in your own mind”— 
NEH.6.9	for all of them sought to frighten us, saying, “their hands will not do the work.” And now, God, strengthen my hands. 
NEH.6.10	Now I went into the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home, and he said, “Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill you—during the night they are coming to kill you.” 
NEH.6.11	But I said, “Should a man like me run away? And would a man like me go into the temple so that he can save his life? I will not go in!” 
NEH.6.12	Then I look and realized God had not sent him; rather, he had spoken the prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 
NEH.6.13	For this reason he was hired: to frighten me so that I would act and sin, so that they would have a bad report so they could taunt me. 
NEH.6.14	Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to their works, and also Noadiah the prophetess, and the remainder of the prophets who were frightening me. 
NEH.6.15	So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days. 
NEH.6.16	When our enemies heard of this, all of the nations surrounding us were afraid and lost their confidence.
NEH.6.17	Also, in those days the nobles of Judah increasingly sent their letters to Tobiah, and letters from Tobiah returned to them. 
NEH.6.18	For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah. His son Jehohanan took as a wife the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah. 
NEH.6.19	They also were speaking of his good deeds in my presence, and they were sending my words out to him. Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me. 
NEH.7.1	 Now when the wall had been built and I had erected the doors and appointed the gatekeepers, singers, and the Levites, 
NEH.7.2	I gave command over Jerusalem to my brother Hanani and Hananiah the commander of the citadel. For he was a faithful man and feared God more than many. 
NEH.7.3	I said to them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot. While they are standing guard let them shut and fasten the doors. And appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, one at his post and another opposite his house.” 
NEH.7.4	The city was widespread and large, but the people in it were few and no houses were rebuilt. 
NEH.7.5	Then my God put into my heart to assemble the nobles, the prefects, and the people to be enrolled. I found the book of the genealogy of those who first came back, and I found this written upon it: 
NEH.7.6	These are the people of the province who came up from captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried into exile. They returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each one to his city. 
NEH.7.7	These came with Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. 
NEH.7.7	The number of the men of the people of Israel: 
NEH.7.8	the descendants
NEH.7.9	The descendants
NEH.7.10	The descendants
NEH.7.11	The descendants

NEH.7.60	All the temple servants and the descendants
NEH.7.61	These were the ones who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they were not able to prove their ancestral houses or their descent, whether they were from Israel: 
NEH.7.62	the descendants
NEH.7.63	And from the priests: the descendants
NEH.7.64	These sought their record among those enrolled in the genealogy, but it was not found there, so they were excluded as unclean from the priesthood. 
NEH.7.65	So the governor said to them that they could not eat the most holy food until a priest could come with Urim and Thummim. 
NEH.7.66	All of the assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty, 
NEH.7.67	besides their servants and female slaves—these were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven. And the male and female singers were two hundred and forty-five,
NEH.7.69	 there were four hundred and thirty-five camels and six thousand seven hundred and twenty male donkeys. 
NEH.7.70	Now some from the heads of the families
NEH.7.71	Now some of the heads of the families
NEH.7.72	And what the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand silver minas, and sixty-seven priestly tunics. 
NEH.7.73	So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all Israel settled in their cities. When the seventh month came, the Israelites
NEH.8.1	All of the people gathered as one to the public square before the Water Gate. They asked Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law
NEH.8.2	So Ezra the priest brought the law
NEH.8.3	He read from it facing the public square before the Water Gate from dawn until noon that day, opposite the men, women, and those with understanding. The ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law.
NEH.8.4	Then Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden podium that had been made for the occasion. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right. On his left was Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. 
NEH.8.5	Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, because he was above all of the people. When he opened it all the people stood up. 
NEH.8.6	Then Ezra blessed Yahweh the great God, and all of the people answered, “Amen! Amen!” while lifting their hands. Then they bowed down and worshiped Yahweh with their noses to the ground. 
NEH.8.7	And Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites were teaching the people from the law
NEH.8.8	So they read the book from the law
NEH.8.9	Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all of the people, “This day is holy to Yahweh your God. Do not mourn nor weep.” For all of the people wept when they heard the words of the law.
NEH.8.10	Then he said to them, “Go, eat festive food and drink sweet drinks, and send a share to those for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our lord. Do not be grieved because the joy of Yahweh is your refuge.” 
NEH.8.11	So the Levites silenced all of the people, saying, “Silence, for this day is holy. Do not be grieved.” 
NEH.8.12	All of the people went to eat, to drink, to send a share, and to have great joy because they understood the words that they had made known to them. 
NEH.8.13	On the second day the heads of the families
NEH.8.14	They found written in the law,
NEH.8.15	and that they should proclaim and give voice in all of their cities in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the hill and bring olive tree branches, olive oil wood branches, myrtle shrub branches, palm tree branches, and other leafy tree branches to make booths, as it is written.” 
NEH.8.16	So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves, each on his roof, in their courtyards, in the courtyards of the house of God, in the public square of the Water Gate, and in the public square of the Gate of Ephraim. 
NEH.8.17	And all of the assembly of those who returned from captivity made booths and lived in the booths because the Israelites
NEH.8.18	And he read from the scroll of the law
NEH.9.1	On the twenty-fourth day of this month the Israelites
NEH.9.2	Those of the seed of Israel separated themselves from all of the foreigners and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their ancestors.
NEH.9.3	They stood up in their place and read from the book of the law
NEH.9.4	Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Kenani stood on the platform of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to Yahweh their God. 
NEH.9.5	Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said, “Stand up, bless Yahweh your God from everlasting until everlasting. Blessed be your glorious name that is being exalted above all blessing and praise! 
NEH.9.6	“You alone are Yahweh. You alone have made the heavens, the heavens of the heavens, and all of their army, the earth and all that is in it, the waters and all that is in them. You give life to all of them, and the army of the heavens worship you. 
NEH.9.7	You are Yahweh, the God who chose Abram and brought him from Ur of the Chaldeans and named him Abraham. 
NEH.9.8	You found his heart faithful before you and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite and the Girgashite—to give it to his seed. And you have kept your word because you are righteous. 
NEH.9.9	“You saw the misery of our ancestors
NEH.9.10	You gave signs and wonders against Pharaoh, all of his servants, and all of the people of his land because you knew that they acted arrogantly against them. You made a name for yourself, as it is this day. 
NEH.9.11	And you divided the sea before them, and they passed through the sea on dry ground, but their pursuers you threw into the depths like a stone into mighty waters. 
NEH.9.12	You led them by day with a column of cloud and with a column of fire by night, to give them light on the way that they were to go. 
NEH.9.13	Then you came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven and gave them right judgments and true teachings, good regulations and commandments. 
NEH.9.14	You made known your holy Sabbath to them and gave them commandments, regulations, and law
NEH.9.15	You gave them bread from heaven for their starvation, and you caused water to go out from a rock for their thirst. You told them to go in order to take into possession the land that you have sworn by your hand to give to them. 
NEH.9.16	“But they and our ancestors
NEH.9.17	They refused to listen and did not remember your wonders that you did among them. They stiffened their neck and in their rebellion determined
NEH.9.18	Even when they made for themselves a molten idol of a calf and said, ‘This is your God who brought you out from Egypt,’ and committed great blasphemies. 
NEH.9.19	But you in your many mercies did not abandon them in the desert. The column of cloud that was over them in the day did not cease to leave them on the way, and the column of fire by night that gave light to them on the way that they went. 
NEH.9.20	And you gave your good Spirit to instruct them and did not withhold your manna from their mouth and gave them water for their thirst. 
NEH.9.21	Forty years you sustained them in the desert—they were not in need. Their clothing did not wear out and their feet did not swell. 
NEH.9.22	And you gave them kingdoms and nations and allotted them a portion. They took into possession the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and the land of Og king of Bashan. 
NEH.9.23	You made their children
NEH.9.24	So the children
NEH.9.25	And they captured fortified cities and a fertile land and took possession of houses filled with every good thing: hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves, and many fruit trees. They ate and became full, and they became fat and took delight in your great goodness. 
NEH.9.26	“But they rebelled and were rebellious against you and cast your law
NEH.9.27	Therefore you gave them into the hand of their enemy, and they brought trouble to them. Then in the time of their trouble they cried out to you, and you heard from the heavens, and according to your great compassions, you gave them saviors, and you saved them from the hand of their enemies. 
NEH.9.28	But when they had rest they returned to doing evil before you, and you abandoned them in the hand of their enemies, and they ruled over them. Then they returned and cried out to you, and from the heavens you heard and many times rescued them according to your compassions. 
NEH.9.29	You warned them so that they would return to your law.
NEH.9.30	You were patient toward them for many years, and you have warned them by your spirit through the hand of your prophets, but they did not listen. So you gave them into the hand of the nations of the lands. 
NEH.9.31	But in your great compassions you did not put an end to them, and you did not abandon them. For you are a gracious and compassionate God. 
NEH.9.32	“And now our God, the great, mighty, and awesome God who keeps his covenant and loyal love, do not belittle in your presence all of the hardship that is found in us, our kings, our officials, our priests, our prophets, our ancestors,
NEH.9.33	You are righteous in everything that has come on us, for you dealt faithfully, and we have acted wickedly. 
NEH.9.34	Our kings, our officials, our priests, and our ancestors
NEH.9.35	And in their kingdom and in the greatness you gave to them, and in the wide and fertile land that you gave before them, they did not serve you and did not turn from their evil deeds. 
NEH.9.36	Behold, we are slaves to this day, and the land that you have given to our ancestors
NEH.9.37	Its rich yield goes to the kings whom you have given over us because of our sins, and they are ruling over our dead bodies and our livestock at their pleasure. We are in great trouble. 
NEH.9.38	 “Now because of all of this we make a binding written agreement and are writing on the sealed documents the names of our commanders, our Levites, and our priests.” 
NEH.10.1	Upon the sealed documents: Nehemiah the governor, son of Hacaliah and Zedekiah;

NEH.10.28	“The rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants, and all who separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to observe the law
NEH.10.29	are helping their brothers, their nobles, and entering into a solemn oath to walk in the law
NEH.10.30	We will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land nor take their daughters for our sons. 
NEH.10.31	And the peoples of the land who bring merchandise and any grain on the Sabbath day to sell, we will not accept it from them on the Sabbath or on a holy day. We will forego the crops of the seventh year and cancel every debt. 
NEH.10.32	“We put on ourselves the commandment upon us to yearly give a third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God: 
NEH.10.33	for the rows of bread, the offering of the daily sacrifice, the continual burnt sacrifice, the Sabbaths, the new moon festivals, the appointed festival times, the holy objects, the sin offerings that make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God. 
NEH.10.34	And we have cast lots for the contributions of the wood offering of the priests, the Levites, and the people to bring it to the house of our God, by our fathers’ houses, at designated times, year by year, to burn on the altar of Yahweh our God—as it is written in the law.
NEH.10.35	We also bring the first fruits of our soil and the first fruits of all the fruit trees, year by year, for the house of Yahweh. 
NEH.10.36	And the firstborn of our sons and beasts—as it is written in the law
NEH.10.37	And we bring the best of our dough, our offerings, the fruit of every tree, new wine, and olive oil to the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and to bring the tithe of our soil to the Levites, for the Levites receive the tithes in all of our rural towns. 
NEH.10.38	And the priest, the descendant
NEH.10.39	For the Israelites
NEH.11.1	Now the commanders of the people lived in Jerusalem, but the remainder of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to live in the holy city of Jerusalem, the other nine’s place was in the other cities. 
NEH.11.2	And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered to live in Jerusalem. 
NEH.11.3	These are the heads of the province who lived in Jerusalem, but in the cities of Judah each one lived on his property in their cities: Israel, the priests, the Levites, the temple servants, and the descendants
NEH.11.4	And some from the descendants
NEH.11.5	and Maaseiah son of Baruch, son of Col-Hozeh, son of Hazaiah, son of Adaiah, son of Jehoiarib, son of Zechariah, son
NEH.11.6	All of the descendants
NEH.11.7	These are the descendants
NEH.11.8	And following after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred and twenty-eight. 
NEH.11.9	And Joel son of Zicri, their chief officer; and Judah son of Hassenuah, second in command over the city. 
NEH.11.10	From the priests: Jedaiah son of Jehoiarib, Jakin, 
NEH.11.11	Seraiah son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son of Zadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub—the leader of the house of God— 
NEH.11.12	and their brothers who did the work of the house, eight hundred and twenty-two. And Adaiah son of Jeroham, son of Pelaliah, son of Amzi, son of Zechariah, son of Pashhur, son of Malkijah, 
NEH.11.13	and his brothers, heads of the families,
NEH.11.14	and their brothers; mighty warriors of strength, one hundred and twenty-eight. The chief officer over them was Zabdiel son of Hagedolim. 
NEH.11.15	Now from the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, son of Bunni; 
NEH.11.16	and Shabbethai and Jehozabad, leaders over the work of the Levites outside of the house of God; 
NEH.11.17	Mattaniah son of Micah, son of Zabdi, son
NEH.11.18	All of the Levites in the holy city were two hundred and eighty-four. 
NEH.11.19	The gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon, and their brothers, the keepers of the gates, one hundred and seventy-two. 
NEH.11.20	And the remainder of Israel, the priests and the Levites, in all of the cities of Judah, each in his inheritance. 
NEH.11.21	But the temple servants were living on the Ophel; Ziha and Gishpa were over the temple servants. 
NEH.11.22	The chief officer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Mica, from the descendants
NEH.11.23	For there was a command of the king concerning them and a regulation concerning the singers, required day by day.
NEH.11.24	And Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, from the descendants
NEH.11.25	As for the villages in their territories, some from the descendants
NEH.11.26	Jeshua, Moladah, Beth Pelet, 
NEH.11.27	Hazar Shual, Beersheba and its settlements,
NEH.11.28	Ziklad, Meconah and its settlements,

NEH.11.34	Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 
NEH.11.35	Lod, and Ono the valley of the artisans. 
NEH.11.36	And from the Levites the working groups of Judah were assigned to Benjamin. 
NEH.12.1	These are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, 
NEH.12.2	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 
NEH.12.3	Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

NEH.12.7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These are the heads of the priests and their brothers in the days of Jeshua. 
NEH.12.8	And the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah and his brothers who were in charge of the songs of thanksgiving. 
NEH.12.9	And Bakbukiah, Unno, their brothers stood opposite them during service. 
NEH.12.10	Jeshua fathered Jehoiakim; Jehoiakim fathered Eliashib; Eliashib fathered Jehoiada; 
NEH.12.11	Jehoiada fathered Jehonathan; Jehonathan fathered Jaddua. 
NEH.12.12	Now in the days of Jehoiakim the priests and the heads of the families
NEH.12.13	of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 
NEH.12.14	of Melichu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; 
NEH.12.15	of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; 
NEH.12.16	of Adaia, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; 
NEH.12.17	of Abijah, Zicri; of Miniamin; of Moadiah, Piltai; 
NEH.12.18	of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 
NEH.12.19	of Jehoiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; 
NEH.12.20	of Sallu, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; 
NEH.12.21	of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; and of Jedaiah, Nethanel. 
NEH.12.22	In the days of Eliashib, Jehoiada, Jehohanan, and Jaddua the Levites were recorded as heads of the families.
NEH.12.23	The descendants
NEH.12.24	And the heads of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their brothers opposite them, to praise and to give thanks by the command of David the man of God, section alongside section. 
NEH.12.25	Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers standing guard at the storerooms of the gates. 
NEH.12.26	These were in the days of Jehoiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jehozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and scribe. 
NEH.12.27	At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites from all of their places in order to bring them to Jerusalem to do the dedication with joy, thanksgivings, song and cymbals, stringed instruments and lyres. 
NEH.12.28	The singers
NEH.12.29	from Beth Gilgal, from the field of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers built for themselves villages all around Jerusalem. 
NEH.12.30	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves and purified the people, the gates, and the wall. 
NEH.12.31	Then I brought the commanders of Judah up on to the wall. I appointed two great choirs; one went in a procession to the right on the wall to the Dung Gate. 
NEH.12.32	After them went Hoshaiah, half of the commanders of Judah, 
NEH.12.33	Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 
NEH.12.35	and the priests
NEH.12.36	and his brothers Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani with the instruments of the songs of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe went before them. 
NEH.12.37	At the Fountain Gate opposite them they went up the steps of the city of David, at the assent to the wall, over the house of David, and up to the Water Gate to the east. 
NEH.12.38	Then the second choir went the opposite way. I followed after them with half of the people on the wall, from over the Tower of the Ovens up to the Wide Wall 
NEH.12.39	and over the Gate of Ephraim, at the Old Gate, at the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, and to the Sheep Gate. And they stopped and stood at the Gate of the Guard. 
NEH.12.40	So the two choirs stood in the house of God, and I and half of the prefects with me; 
NEH.12.41	and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah with the trumpets; 
NEH.12.42	Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang with Jizrahiah the chief officer. 
NEH.12.43	They offered on that day great sacrifices and rejoiced because God brought great joy to them. And the women and children also rejoiced. The joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar. 
NEH.12.44	On that day men were appointed for the storehouse rooms, the offerings, the first fruits, and the tithes, in order to gather in them from the fields of the cities the requirements of the law
NEH.12.45	They kept the responsibility of their God and the responsibility of cleansing, and the singers and gatekeepers, according to the command of David and his son Solomon. 
NEH.12.46	For in the days of David and Asaph from ancient times there was the head of the singers and a song of praise and thanksgiving to God. 
NEH.12.47	So all of Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave the daily food portions of the singers and gatekeepers. And they set apart that which was for the Levites, and the Levites set apart that which was for the descendants
NEH.13.1	On that day the book of Moses was read in the hearing of the people and it was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever come into the assembly of God 
NEH.13.2	because they did not come to meet the Israelites
NEH.13.3	So it happened when they heard the law
NEH.13.4	Before this, Eliashib the priest who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God—the one related to Tobiah— 
NEH.13.5	prepared for Tobiah a large chamber where they had formerly put the grain offering, the frankincense, the temple objects, tithes of grain, wine, and oil commanded for the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the offerings of the priests. 
NEH.13.6	During all of this, I was not in Jerusalem because in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king. At the end of some days I asked permission from the king to leave. 
NEH.13.7	So I came to Jerusalem. And I came to learn of the wrong that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by making him a room in the courtyard of the house of God. 
NEH.13.8	It was very displeasing for me, and I threw all of the objects from the house of Tobiah outside of the chamber. 
NEH.13.9	And I spoke in order, and they cleansed the chambers. Then I returned the objects of the house of God—the grain offering and the frankincense. 
NEH.13.10	And then I came to learn that the food of the Levites had not been given to them, so that the Levites and the singers, the doers of the work, had gone back each to his field. 
NEH.13.11	So I quarreled with the prefects, and I said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” And I gathered them and set them at their station. 
NEH.13.12	So all of Judah brought the tithe of grain, new wine, and olive oil into the storehouses. 
NEH.13.13	I appointed as treasurer over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, Pedaiah from the Levites, and as their hand Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, for they were considered faithful. The responsibility given to them was to distribute to their brothers. 
NEH.13.14	Remember me, my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my loyal acts which I have done in the house of my God and in his service. 
NEH.13.15	In those days I saw in Judah people treading the wine press on the Sabbath, bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys along with wine, grapes and figs, and every kind of burden and bringing it all to Jerusalem on the day of the Sabbath. And I warned them at that time against selling food. 
NEH.13.16	Tyrian men who lived in Jerusalem brought fish and every kind of merchandise and sold it on the Sabbath to the descendants
NEH.13.17	So I quarreled with the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the day of the Sabbath? 
NEH.13.18	Did not your ancestors
NEH.13.19	So when it became dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors be shut and said that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. And I appointed some of my young men over the gates to prevent any goods
NEH.13.20	So the merchants and the sellers of merchandise spent the night outside of Jerusalem once or twice. 
NEH.13.21	But I warned them and said to them, “Why are you spending the night opposite the wall? If you do it again, I will lay hands against you.” From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath. 
NEH.13.22	And then I told two Levites that they must purify themselves and come to guard the gates in order to consecrate the day of the Sabbath. Remember this also, my God, and take pity on me according to the greatness of your loyal love. 
NEH.13.23	Also in those days I saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. 
NEH.13.24	Half of their children spoke Ashdodite and could not speak Judean, but only the tongues of other nations. 
NEH.13.25	So I quarreled with them and cursed them and beat some of their men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath by God: “Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves. 
NEH.13.26	Did not King Solomon of Israel sin in this way? And among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Yet the foreign women made even him sin. 
NEH.13.27	Should we listen to you all and do this great evil, acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?” 
NEH.13.28	One from the sons of Jehoiada, son of the high priest Eliashib, who was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonote was there. I chased him away from me. 
NEH.13.29	Remember them, my God, because of their defilements of the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites. 
NEH.13.30	So I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established responsibilities for the priests and Levites, each in his own work, 
NEH.13.31	a contribution of the wood offering at appointed times, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good. 
EST.1.1	And it happened in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Cush
EST.1.2	In those days as King Ahasuerus was sitting on the throne of his kingdom, which was in the citadel of Susa, 
EST.1.3	he gave a banquet in the third year of his reign for all his officials and servants. The army of Persia and Media and the nobles and officials of the provinces were in his presence 
EST.1.4	as he displayed the wealth of the glory of his kingdom and the glorious splendor of his greatness for many days, one hundred and eighty days
EST.1.5	And when those days were completed, the king gave for all the people that were present at the citadel of Susa, both great and small, a banquet in the courtyard of the king’s palace garden that lasted seven days. 
EST.1.6	There were curtains of finely woven linen and blue cloth tied with cords of fine white linen and purple cloth to silver curtain rings and pillars of alabaster, and couches of gold and silver on a paved floor of alabaster, precious stone, mother-of-pearl, and costly stones.
EST.1.7	Drinks were served in goblets of gold and goblets of different kinds,
EST.1.8	There were no restrictions on the drinking, for the king had instructed every official of his palace to do as each one pleased. 
EST.1.9	Furthermore, Queen Vashti gave a banquet for the women in the palace
EST.1.10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he said to Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, seven of the eunuchs attending King Ahasuerus, 
EST.1.11	to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown
EST.1.12	But Queen Vashti refused to come at the word of the king that was conveyed by
EST.1.13	And the king said to the wise men, the ones who know the times
EST.1.14	and those next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, Memucan, the seven officials of Persia and Media who had access to the king
EST.1.15	“According to the law, what is to be done with Queen Vashti, because she has not done the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed by
EST.1.16	And Memucan said before the king and the officials, “Not only has Queen Vashti done wrong to the king, but to all the officials and all of the people who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. 
EST.1.17	For this deed of the queen will be known
EST.1.18	This day the women of nobility from Persia and Media will respond to all the officials of the king and there will be no end to contempt and anger. 
EST.1.19	If it pleases
EST.1.20	And let the king’s decree that he will make be proclaimed in all his kingdom, because it is vast and all the women will honor their husbands, great and small.”
EST.1.21	This advice pleased the king
EST.1.22	And he sent letters to all the provinces of the king, to each province according to its own script, and to every people in their own language,
EST.2.1	After these things, when the anger of King Ahasuerus subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her. 
EST.2.2	And the king’s servants attending him said, “Let them seek attractive young virgins for the king. 
EST.2.3	Let the king appoint chief officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, and let them gather every attractive young virgin to the harem
EST.2.4	And let the young woman who is pleasing
EST.2.5	There was a Jew in the citadel of Susa whose name was Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite, 
EST.2.6	who was deported
EST.2.7	He
EST.2.8	And it happened, at the proclaiming of the edict of the king and his law, when many young women were being gathered to the citadel of Susa under Hegai’s care,
EST.2.9	The young woman pleased him
EST.2.10	Esther did not disclose her people and her family because Modecai had charged her that she must not tell. 
EST.2.11	And every day Modecai would walk up and down in front of the courtyard of the harem
EST.2.12	When the turn came for each girl to go to King Ahasuerus, after the end of twelve months of being under the regulations of the women—for the days of their beauty treatments had to be filled, six months with the oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and women’s cosmetics—
EST.2.13	in this way, the girl goes to the king and all that she asks is given to her to take
EST.2.14	In the evening she would go and in the morning she would return to the second harem
EST.2.15	When the turn came near for Esther daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as a daughter, to go to the king, she did not ask anything except what Hegai the eunuch of the king who was in charge of the women, advised. And Esther carried favor in the eyes of everyone that saw her. 
EST.2.16	Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, to his palace,
EST.2.17	And the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she won his favor and loyalty more than all the virgins, so he put a royal crown
EST.2.18	And the king gave a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his officials and servants. And he granted a tax amnesty
EST.2.19	When the virgins were gathered a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the gate of the king. 
EST.2.20	Esther had not made known her family and her people, just as Mordecai had instructed her; for Esther did what Mordecai told her,
EST.2.21	In those days Mordecai was sitting at the gate of the king. Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs from the keepers of the threshold, became angry and they conspired to assassinate
EST.2.22	And the matter became known to Mordecai and he told it to Queen Esther, and Esther told it to the king in the name of Mordecai. 
EST.2.23	And the matter was investigated and found to be so; and the two of them were hanged on the gallows, and it was written in the scroll of the events of the days before the presence of the king. 
EST.3.1	After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and he exalted him and set his position
EST.3.2	And all of the king’s servants who were at the gate of the king were kneeling and bowing down to Haman; for so the king had commanded concerning him, but Mordecai did not kneel and bow down. 
EST.3.3	And the king’s servants who were at the gate of the king said to Mordecai, “Why are you transgressing the command of the king?” 
EST.3.4	They spoke to him day after day, but he did not listen to them, and they informed Haman to see if Mordecai’s resolve would prevail;
EST.3.5	And Haman saw that Mordecai was not kneeling and bowing down to him, and he was filled with anger. 
EST.3.6	But he considered it beneath him
EST.3.7	In the first month, that is, the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasurus, he cast pur—that is, the lot—before the presence of Haman for the day and for the month,
EST.3.8	And Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered and separated among the peoples in all of the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from every other people, and they do not observe
EST.3.9	If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will pay
EST.3.10	So the king removed his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. 
EST.3.11	And the king said to Haman, “The money is given to you and to the people to do with it as you see fit.
EST.3.12	And the king’s secretaries were called in the first month on the thirteenth day, and a decree was issued, according to all that Haman commanded, to the satraps of the king and to the governors who were over all the provinces, and to the officials of all the people, to each province according to its own script and to all people according to their own language; it was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and was sealed with the king’s ring. 
EST.3.13	Letters were sent by couriers
EST.3.14	A copy of the edict was presented as law in every province making it known to all the people to be ready for that day. 
EST.3.15	The couriers went out quickly by order of the king, and the law was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; and the city of Susa was bewildered.
EST.4.1	Mordecai learned all that had been done and he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes. And he went through the middle of the city and cried out a loud and bitter cry; 
EST.4.2	he went up to the entrance of the gate of the king, for he could not go to the gate of the king in sackcloth. 
EST.4.3	In every province each place where the king’s edict and his law came, there was great mourning for the Jews with fasting, crying, wailing, and sackcloth; and ashes were spread out as a bed for them. 
EST.4.4	And Esther’s maids and her eunuchs came and they told her, and the queen was deeply distressed; she sent garments to clothe Mordecai so that he might remove his sackcloth—but he did not accept them. 
EST.4.5	Then Esther called Hathach from the king’s eunuchs who regularly attended to her,
EST.4.6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to the public square of the city, which was in front of the gate of the king, 
EST.4.7	and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact amount of money that Haman has promised to pay to the treasury of the king for the destruction of the Jews. 
EST.4.8	And he gave him a copy of the edict of the law that had been issued in Susa for their destruction to show Esther, and to inform her, and to charge her to go to the king and make supplication to him and entreat before him for her people. 
EST.4.9	And Hathach went back and told Esther the words of Mordecai. 
EST.4.10	And Esther spoke to Hathach and she gave him a message for Mordecai:
EST.4.11	“All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that if any man or woman who goes to the king to the inner courtyard, who is not called, he has one law, to be killed, except if the king extends to him the gold scepter so that he may live. I have not been called to come to the king for thirty days.”
EST.4.12	And they told Mordecai the words of Esther. 
EST.4.13	Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther: “Do not think that your life will be saved in the palace of the king more than all the Jews. 
EST.4.14	For if indeed you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, and you and the family of your father will perish. Who knows? Perhaps you have come to a royal position for a time such as this.” 
EST.4.15	Esther replied to Mordecai: 
EST.4.16	“Go, gather all the Jews that are found in Susa and fast for me; do not eat or drink for three days, both night and day. I and my young girls will fast likewise, and then I will go to the king, which is not according to the law; if I perish, I perish. 
EST.4.17	And Mordecai went away and he did everything that Esther commanded him. 
EST.5.1	And it happened, on the third day, and Esther put on royal clothes, and she stood in the inner courtyard of the king’s palace,
EST.5.2	When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard she found favor in his eyes, and the king held out the gold scepter that was in his hand to Esther, and Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter. 
EST.5.3	And the king said to her, “What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It will be given to you—even half the kingdom.” 
EST.5.4	And Esther said, “If it is good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.” 
EST.5.5	And the king said, “Bring Haman quickly to fulfill
EST.5.6	And the king said to Esther while they were drinking wine,
EST.5.7	And Esther answered and said, “This is my petition and my request. 
EST.5.8	If I have found favor in the eyes of the king,
EST.5.9	And Haman went out on that day rejoicing and feeling good.
EST.5.10	But Haman controlled himself and went to his house, and he sent for and brought his friends and Zeresh his wife. 
EST.5.11	And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his wealth and the number of his sons and all the ways that the king had honored him and promoted him above the officials and king’s servants. 
EST.5.12	And Haman added,
EST.5.13	But all this fails to satisfy me
EST.5.14	And Zeresh his wife and all of his friends said to him, “Let them make a gallows fifty cubits
EST.6.1	During that night the king’s sleep escaped him, and he gave orders to bring the scroll of records and chronicles,
EST.6.2	And it was found written how Mordecai had reported concerning Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs from the keepers of the threshold who had conspired to assassinate
EST.6.3	And the king asked, “What has been done to bestow honor to Mordecai for this?” And the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.” 
EST.6.4	And the king asked, “Who is in the courtyard?” Haman had just come to the courtyard of the king’s outer palace to tell the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. 
EST.6.5	And the king’s servants said to him, “Look! Haman is standing in the courtyard.” And the king said, “Let him come.” 
EST.6.6	And Haman came, and the king said to him, “What is to be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?” And Haman thought to himself, “Whom would the king wish to honor more than me?” 
EST.6.7	So Haman said to the king, “For a man whom the king wishes to honor, 
EST.6.8	let them bring royal clothing
EST.6.9	And let the clothing and the horse be given to the man
EST.6.10	Then the king said to Haman, “Quickly, take the clothing and the horse, just as you have said, and do so to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the gate of the king; you must not leave out anything from what you have said.” 
EST.6.11	So Haman took the clothing and the horse, and he clothed Mordecai and let him ride through the public square of the city; and he proclaimed before him, “Thus, it is done to the man whom the king wishes to honor.” 
EST.6.12	Then Mordecai returned to the gate of the king, and Haman rushed to his house mournful and with his head covered. 
EST.6.13	And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends all that had happened to him. And his advisers and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is from the descendants of the Jews,
EST.6.14	As they were still speaking with him the king’s eunuchs arrived and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 
EST.7.1	So the king and Haman went to dine
EST.7.2	And the king again said to Esther, on the second day while they were drinking,
EST.7.3	Then Queen Esther answered, and she said, “If I have found favor in your eyes,
EST.7.4	I and my people have been sold to be destroyed and killed, to be annihilated. If we had been sold as male and female slaves I would have kept quiet, because this
EST.7.5	And King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who gave himself the right to do this?”
EST.7.6	And Esther said, “The adversary and enemy is this evil Haman!” And Haman was terrified before the king and queen. 
EST.7.7	The king rose in his anger from the banquet
EST.7.8	And the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall,
EST.7.9	And Habrona, one of the eunuchs in the presence of the king, said, “Look, the same gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai who spoke good for the sake of the king stands at Haman’s house, fifty cubits high.” And the king said, “Hang him on it.” 
EST.7.10	And they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai, and the anger of the king was abated. 
EST.8.1	On that day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews; and Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was to her. 
EST.8.2	And the king removed his signet ring that he had taken away from Haman, and he gave it to Mordecai. So Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. 
EST.8.3	And Esther again spoke before the king, and she fell before his feet and wept, pleading for his grace to avert Haman the Agagite’s evil plan and the plot that he devised against the Jews. 
EST.8.4	And the king held out to Esther the scepter of gold, and Esther rose and stood before the king, 
EST.8.5	and she said, “If it is good to the king, and if I have found favor before him,
EST.8.6	For how can I bear
EST.8.7	And King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Look, I have given Haman’s house to Esther, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he plotted against
EST.8.8	Write as you see fit
EST.8.9	And the secretaries of the king were summoned
EST.8.10	And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and he sealed the letters with the king’s signet ring and sent them
EST.8.11	In them the king allowed the Jews who were in every city to assemble and defend their lives,
EST.8.12	in one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. 
EST.8.13	A copy of the edict
EST.8.14	The mounted couriers on the royal horses went out without delay, urged by the king’s word. The law was given in the citadel of Susa. 
EST.8.15	Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal clothing
EST.8.16	For the Jews, there was light and gladness, joy and honor. 
EST.8.17	In every province and city, wherever the king’s edict and his law came, there was gladness and joy for the Jews, a banquet and a holiday,
EST.9.1	In the twelfth month, that is the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day, on which the edict of the king arrived and his law was enacted, on the day in which the enemies of the Jews had hoped to gain power over them but was overturned, and the Jews gained power against their enemies, 
EST.9.2	the Jews gathered in their cities in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to strike against
EST.9.3	All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, governors, and those who did the work of the king
EST.9.4	For Mordecai was high-ranking in the king’s palace
EST.9.5	The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword,
EST.9.6	And in the citadel of Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men,
EST.9.7	and Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
EST.9.8	Portha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
EST.9.9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 
EST.9.10	the ten sons of Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews; but they did not touch
EST.9.11	On that day the number of those being killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to
EST.9.12	And the king said to Queen Esther, “In the citadel of Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? What is your petition? It will be granted to you. And what further is your request? It will be done.” 
EST.9.13	Esther replied, “If it is good to the king, let tomorrow also be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do according to the edict of today; and let them hang Haman’s ten sons on the gallows.” 
EST.9.14	And the king said to do so. And a decree was issued in Susa and Haman’s ten sons were hanged. 
EST.9.15	And the Jews were gathered who were in Susa, and on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they killed in Susa three hundred men, but they did not touch
EST.9.16	The rest of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered and defended their lives
EST.9.17	This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. They rested on the fourteenth day and made it a day of feasting and joy. 
EST.9.18	But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth day, and rested on the fifteenth day. And they made it a day of feasting and joy. 
EST.9.19	Therefore the Jews in the rural areas, living in the rural towns, made the fourteenth month of Adar a day of joy and feasting, a festive day of giving gifts to each other. 
EST.9.20	Mordecai wrote down these things and he sent letters to all the Jews who were in all of the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, 
EST.9.21	to impose on them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and the fifteenth day, every year,
EST.9.22	as the day that the Jews found relief
EST.9.23	And the Jews adopted what they had begun to do and what Mordecai had written to them. 
EST.9.24	For Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and he had cast pur, that is the lot, to rout them out and destroy them. 
EST.9.25	But when it came
EST.9.26	Therefore they called these days Purim, because of the name Pur. Thus because of all the words of this letter, and of what they faced concerning this, and of what had happened to them, 
EST.9.27	the Jews established and adopted it for themselves and for their offspring, and for all who joined them. They did not neglect to observe
EST.9.28	These days are to be remembered and are to be kept in every generation, and in family, province, and city; and these days of Purim are not to be neglected among the Jews, and their memory shall not come to an end among their offspring. 
EST.9.29	So Queen Esther the daughter of Abihail and Mordecai the Jew wrote in full authority to confirm this second letter of Purim. 
EST.9.30	He sent letters of words of peace and truth to all the Jews, to the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces
EST.9.31	to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had imposed, and just as they had imposed on themselves and their offspring regulations of the fast and their lament. 
EST.9.32	And the command of Esther established these practices of Purim, and it was written on the scroll. 
EST.10.1	King Ahasuerus imposed forced labor on the land and islands of the sea. 
EST.10.2	All the work of his authority and his powerful deeds,
EST.10.3	For Mordecai the Jew was second-in-command to King Ahasuerus. He was great for the Jews and popular with many of his brothers, for he sought good for his people, interceding for the welfare of all his descendants.

JOB.3.18	they do not hear the oppressor’s voice. 
JOB.3.19	The small and the great are there, 
JOB.3.19	and the slave is free from his masters.
JOB.3.20	“Why does he
JOB.3.20	and life to those bitter of soul, 
JOB.3.21	who wait for death, but
JOB.3.21	and search
JOB.3.22	who rejoice exceedingly,
JOB.3.22	and they are glad when they find the grave? 
JOB.3.23	Why does he
JOB.3.23	and God has fenced him in all around? 
JOB.3.24	For
JOB.3.24	and my groanings gush forth like water 
JOB.3.25	because the dread that I feel
JOB.3.25	and what I feared befalls me. 
JOB.3.26	I am not at ease, and I am not at peace, 
JOB.3.26	and I do not have rest, thus
JOB.4.1	Then
JOB.4.2	“If someone would test a word with you, would you be offended? 
JOB.4.2	But
JOB.4.3	Look, you have instructed many, 
JOB.4.3	and you have strengthened weak hands. 
JOB.4.4	Your words have raised up the one who stumbles, 
JOB.4.4	and you have strengthened knees giving way. 
JOB.4.5	But now it has come to you, and you are worn out; 
JOB.4.5	it touches you, and you are horrified. 
JOB.4.6	Is not your fear in God your confidence? 
JOB.4.6	Is not your hope even
JOB.4.7	“Think
JOB.4.7	Or
JOB.4.8	Just as I have seen, plowers of mischief 
JOB.4.8	and sowers of trouble will reap it. 
JOB.4.9	By
JOB.4.9	and by
JOB.4.10	The roar of the lion and the voice of a lion in its prime, 
JOB.4.10	and the teeth of the young lions are broken. 
JOB.4.11	The lion is perishing without
JOB.4.11	and the lion’s whelps are scattered. 
JOB.4.12	“And a word came stealing to me, 
JOB.4.12	and my ear received the whisper from it. 
JOB.4.13	Amid troubling thoughts from night visions, 
JOB.4.13	at the falling of deep sleep on men, 
JOB.4.14	dread met me, and trembling, 
JOB.4.14	and it made many of my bones shake. 
JOB.4.15	And a spirit glided before my face; 
JOB.4.15	the hair of my flesh
JOB.4.16	It stood still, but
JOB.4.16	a form was before
JOB.4.16	there was a hush, and I heard a voice: 
JOB.4.17	‘Can a human being be more righteous than God, 
JOB.4.17	or can a man be more pure than his Maker? 
JOB.4.18	Look, he does not trust in his servants 
JOB.4.18	and he charges his angels with error. 
JOB.4.19	How much more dwellers in clay houses, 
JOB.4.19	whose foundation is in the dust? 
JOB.4.19	They are crushed like a moth. 
JOB.4.20	Between morning and evening
JOB.4.20	without anyone regarding it they perish forever. 
JOB.4.21	Is not their tent cord pulled up within them? 
JOB.4.21	They die, but
JOB.5.1	“Call now, is there anyone answering you? 
JOB.5.1	And to which of the holy ones will you turn? 
JOB.5.2	For vexation will slay the fool, 
JOB.5.2	and jealousy will kill the simple. 
JOB.5.3	I have seen a fool taking root, 
JOB.5.3	but
JOB.5.4	His children are far from deliverance, 
JOB.5.4	and they are crushed in the gate, 
JOB.5.4	and there is no deliverer— 
JOB.5.5	whose harvest the hungry eats, 
JOB.5.5	and he takes it from behind
JOB.5.5	and the thirsty pants after their wealth. 
JOB.5.6	Indeed,
JOB.5.6	and trouble does not sprout from the earth. 
JOB.5.7	But a human being is born to trouble, 
JOB.5.7	and they soar aloft
JOB.5.8	“But I myself
JOB.5.8	and to God I would commit my cause. 
JOB.5.9	He is doing great and unsearchable
JOB.5.9	marvelous things without number
JOB.5.10	the one who is giving rain on the surface of
JOB.5.10	and is sending water on the surface of
JOB.5.11	to set the lowly on high, 
JOB.5.11	and those mourning are lifted to safety. 
JOB.5.12	He is frustrating the devices of the crafty, 
JOB.5.12	and their hands do not achieve success. 
JOB.5.13	He is capturing the wise in their craftiness, 
JOB.5.13	and the schemes of the wily are rushed. 
JOB.5.14	In the daytime they meet with darkness, 
JOB.5.14	and they grope at noon
JOB.5.15	And
JOB.5.15	even
JOB.5.16	So
JOB.5.16	and wickedness shuts its mouth. 
JOB.5.17	“Look, happy is the human being whom God reproves; 
JOB.5.17	and you must not despise the discipline of Shaddai, 
JOB.5.18	for he himself
JOB.5.18	he strikes, but
JOB.5.19	From
JOB.5.19	and in seven evil shall not touch you. 
JOB.5.20	In famine he will redeem you from death, 
JOB.5.20	and in war from the power of
JOB.5.21	From the scourge of the tongue you shall be hidden, 
JOB.5.21	and you shall not be afraid of
JOB.5.22	At destruction and famine
JOB.5.22	and you shall not fear the wild animals of the earth. 
JOB.5.23	For your covenant will be with the stones of the field, 
JOB.5.23	and the wild animals
JOB.5.24	And you shall know that your tent is safe, 
JOB.5.24	and you will inspect your fold, and you shall not be missing anything. 
JOB.5.25	And you shall know that your offspring are many, 
JOB.5.25	and your descendants like the vegetation of the earth. 
JOB.5.26	You shall come in maturity to the grave, 
JOB.5.26	as the raising up of a stack of sheaves in its season. 
JOB.5.27	“Look, we have searched this out—it is true; 
JOB.5.27	hear it and know it yourself.”
JOB.6.1	  Then
JOB.6.2	“If only my vexation could be well weighed, 
JOB.6.2	and my calamity could be lifted up together with it in the balances, 
JOB.6.3	for then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; 
JOB.6.3	therefore my words have been rash, 
JOB.6.4	for the arrows of Shaddai are in me; 
JOB.6.4	my spirit drinks their poison; 
JOB.6.4	the terrors of God are arrayed against me. 
JOB.6.5	Does the wild ass bray over grass, 
JOB.6.5	or the ox bellow over its fodder? 
JOB.6.6	Can tasteless food be eaten without
JOB.6.6	or is there taste in the white of a marshmallow plant? 
JOB.6.7	I refused
JOB.6.7	they are like food that will make me ill.
JOB.6.8	“O that
JOB.6.8	and that God may grant my hope, 
JOB.6.9	that
JOB.6.9	that he would let loose his hand and kill me.
JOB.6.10	But
JOB.6.10	and I would recoil in unrelenting
JOB.6.10	for I have not denied the words of the Holy One. 
JOB.6.11	What is my strength, that I should wait? 
JOB.6.11	And what is my end, that I should hold out?
JOB.6.12	Or is my strength like the strength of stones? 
JOB.6.12	Or is my flesh bronze? 
JOB.6.13	Indeed,
JOB.6.13	and any success is driven from me. 
JOB.6.14	“Loyal love
JOB.6.14	even if
JOB.6.15	My companions are treacherous like a torrent-bed; 
JOB.6.15	like a streambed of wadis
JOB.6.16	which are growing dark because of ice upon them, 
JOB.6.16	it will pile up snow. 
JOB.6.17	In time they dry up, they disappear; 
JOB.6.17	when it is hot, they vanish from their place. 
JOB.6.18	The paths of their way wind around; 
JOB.6.18	they go up into the wasteland, and they perish. 
JOB.6.19	The caravans of Tema looked; 
JOB.6.19	the traveling merchants of Sheba hope for them. 
JOB.6.20	They are disappointed, because they trusted; 
JOB.6.20	they came here
JOB.6.21	“For now you
JOB.6.21	you see terrors, and you fear. 
JOB.6.22	Is it because I have said, ‘Give to me,’ 
JOB.6.22	or,
JOB.6.23	or,
JOB.6.23	or,
JOB.6.24	Teach me, and I myself
JOB.6.24	and make me understand how I have gone astray. 
JOB.6.25	How painful are upright words!
JOB.6.25	But
JOB.6.26	Do you intend to reprove my words
JOB.6.26	and consider the words of a desperate man as wind? 
JOB.6.27	Even over the orphan you would cast the lot, 
JOB.6.27	and you would bargain over your friend. 
JOB.6.28	“Therefore
JOB.6.28	and I surely will not lie to your face.
JOB.6.29	Please turn, let no injustice happen; 
JOB.6.29	indeed,
JOB.6.30	Is there injustice on my tongue? 
JOB.6.30	Or can my palate not discern calamity?
JOB.7.1	“Does not a human being
JOB.7.1	And are not his
JOB.7.2	Like a slave he longs for the shadow, 
JOB.7.2	and like a laborer he waits for his wages. 
JOB.7.3	So I had to inherit
JOB.7.3	and nights of misery are apportioned to me. 
JOB.7.4	When I lie down, I say,
JOB.7.4	But
JOB.7.4	and I have my fill of tossing until dawn. 
JOB.7.5	My body is clothed with maggots and clods of dust; 
JOB.7.5	my skin hardens, then
JOB.7.6	“My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, 
JOB.7.6	and they come to an end without hope.
JOB.7.7	Remember that my life is a breath; 
JOB.7.7	my eye will not return to see good. 
JOB.7.8	The eye of the one seeing me will not see me; 
JOB.7.8	your eyes are upon me, but
JOB.7.9	A cloud vanishes, and it goes away, 
JOB.7.9	so he who goes down to Sheol will not come up. 
JOB.7.10	He does not return again to his house, 
JOB.7.10	and his place does not recognize him again. 
JOB.7.11	“Even
JOB.7.11	I will speak in my spirit’s anguish; 
JOB.7.11	I will complain in my inner self’s
JOB.7.12	Am I the sea, or a sea monster, 
JOB.7.12	that you set a guard over me? 
JOB.7.13	When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me, 
JOB.7.13	and my couch
JOB.7.14	then
JOB.7.14	and with visions you terrify
JOB.7.15	So
JOB.7.15	death more than my existence.
JOB.7.16	I loathe my life; I would not live forever; 
JOB.7.16	depart from me, for my days are a breath. 
JOB.7.17	“What is a human being that you make him great 
JOB.7.17	and that you fix your mind on him,
JOB.7.18	so that
JOB.7.18	you test him every moment?
JOB.7.19	How long
JOB.7.19	Or not leave me alone until I swallow
JOB.7.20	If I have sinned, what have I done to you, watcher of humanity? 
JOB.7.20	Why have you made me as a target for yourself, 
JOB.7.20	so that
JOB.7.21	And why do you not pardon my transgression 
JOB.7.21	and take away my guilt? 
JOB.7.21	For now I shall lie in the dust, 
JOB.7.21	and you will seek me, but
JOB.8.1	Then
JOB.8.2	“How long
JOB.8.2	and the words of your mouth be a mighty wind? 
JOB.8.3	Does God pervert justice, 
JOB.8.3	or
JOB.8.4	If your children sinned against him, 
JOB.8.4	then
JOB.8.5	If you yourself
JOB.8.5	then
JOB.8.6	If you are pure and upright, 
JOB.8.6	indeed,
JOB.8.6	and he will restore your righteous abode. 
JOB.8.7	Though
JOB.8.7	your end
JOB.8.8	“Indeed,
JOB.8.8	and consider what their ancestors have found,
JOB.8.9	for we are of yesterday, and we do not know, 
JOB.8.9	for our days on earth are a shadow. 
JOB.8.10	Will they themselves
JOB.8.10	and utter
JOB.8.11	Can papyrus grow tall where there is not a marsh? 
JOB.8.11	Will reeds flourish without water?
JOB.8.12	While it is in its flower and is not plucked, 
JOB.8.12	yet
JOB.8.13	So are the paths of all who forget God; 
JOB.8.13	and the hope of the godless will perish, 
JOB.8.14	whose confidence is cut off 
JOB.8.14	and whose trust
JOB.8.15	He will lean himself against his house, but
JOB.8.15	he will take hold of it, but
JOB.8.16	He is thriving
JOB.8.16	and his plant shoots spread over his garden. 
JOB.8.17	His roots twine over a stone heap; 
JOB.8.17	he sees a house of stone. 
JOB.8.18	If he destroys him from his place, 
JOB.8.18	then
JOB.8.19	Look, this is the joy of his way, 
JOB.8.19	and from dust others will spring up. 
JOB.8.20	“Look, God will not reject the blameless, 
JOB.8.20	and he will not uphold the hand of evildoers. 
JOB.8.21	Yet he will fill your mouth with laughter 
JOB.8.21	and your lips with a shout of joy. 
JOB.8.22	Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, 
JOB.8.22	and the tent of the wicked will be no more.”
JOB.9.1	Then
JOB.9.2	“Truly I know that it is so, 
JOB.9.2	but
JOB.9.3	If he wants to contend with him, 
JOB.9.3	he cannot answer him one time in a thousand. 
JOB.9.4	He is wise in
JOB.9.4	who has resisted him and succeeded?
JOB.9.5	“He is the one who moves mountains, and they do not know how, 
JOB.9.5	who overturns them in his anger. 
JOB.9.6	He is the one who shakes the earth from its place, 
JOB.9.6	and its pillars tremble. 
JOB.9.7	He is the one who commands the sun, and it does not rise, 
JOB.9.7	and he seals up the stars.
JOB.9.8	He is the one who alone stretches out the heavens 
JOB.9.8	and who tramples on the waves of the sea. 
JOB.9.9	He is the one who made the Bear and Orion, 
JOB.9.9	the Pleiades and the constellations of the south. 
JOB.9.10	He is the one who does great things beyond understanding
JOB.9.10	and marvelous things beyond number.
JOB.9.11	“If
JOB.9.11	and if he should move on, I would not recognize him.
JOB.9.12	If
JOB.9.12	Who could say to him, ‘What are you doing?’ 
JOB.9.13	God will not turn back his anger; 
JOB.9.13	beneath him the helpers of Rahab bow. 
JOB.9.14	How much less
JOB.9.14	How can I choose my words with him, 
JOB.9.15	whom I cannot answer, even though I am righteous? 
JOB.9.15	From
JOB.9.16	If I summon him, and he should answer me, 
JOB.9.16	I do not believe that he will listen to my voice— 
JOB.9.17	who crushes me with a tempest 
JOB.9.17	and multiplies
JOB.9.18	He will not allow me to catch
JOB.9.18	rather, he will fill me with bitterness. 
JOB.9.19	If it is a matter of
JOB.9.19	But
JOB.9.20	Even though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me; 
JOB.9.20	even though I am blameless, yet
JOB.9.21	“I am blameless; I do not care about myself;
JOB.9.21	I loathe my life. 
JOB.9.22	It is all one; therefore I say, 
JOB.9.22	‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’ 
JOB.9.23	When the whip
JOB.9.23	he mocks at the despair of the innocent. 
JOB.9.24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; 
JOB.9.24	he covers the face of its judge— 
JOB.9.24	if it is not he, then who is it? 
JOB.9.25	“And my days are swifter than a runner; 
JOB.9.25	they flee away; they do not see good. 
JOB.9.26	They go by like papyrus skiffs, 
JOB.9.26	like an eagle swoops down on its prey. 
JOB.9.27	Though
JOB.9.27	I will change my expression, and I will rejoice,’ 
JOB.9.28	I become afraid of all my sufferings; 
JOB.9.28	I know that you do not consider me innocent. 
JOB.9.29	If I shall be declared guilty, 
JOB.9.29	why then should I labor in vain? 
JOB.9.30	If I wash myself with soap,
JOB.9.30	and I cleanse my hands with lye, 
JOB.9.31	then you plunge me into the slime pit, 
JOB.9.31	and my clothes abhor me. 
JOB.9.32	“For
JOB.9.32	that we can come to trial together.
JOB.9.33	There is no arbiter between us 
JOB.9.33	that he might lay his hand on both of us. 
JOB.9.34	May he remove his rod from me, 
JOB.9.34	and let his dread not terrify me; 
JOB.9.35	then I would speak and not fear him,
JOB.9.35	for in myself I am not fearful.
JOB.10.1	“My inner self
JOB.10.1	I want to give vent to my complaint;
JOB.10.1	I want to speak out of the bitterness of my inner self.
JOB.10.2	I will say to God, ‘You should not condemn me; 
JOB.10.2	let me know why you contend against me. 
JOB.10.3	Is it good for you that you oppress, 
JOB.10.3	that you despise the labor of your hands, 
JOB.10.3	and you smile over the schemes of the wicked? 
JOB.10.4	Do you have eyes of flesh?
JOB.10.4	Or do you see as human beings see?
JOB.10.5	Are your days as the days of human beings, 
JOB.10.5	or your years as the days of man, 
JOB.10.6	that you seek out my iniquity, 
JOB.10.6	and you search for my sin 
JOB.10.7	because of your knowledge that I am not guilty, 
JOB.10.7	and there is no escaping from your hand? 
JOB.10.8	Your hands fashioned me and made me
JOB.10.8	then
JOB.10.9	Please
JOB.10.9	but
JOB.10.10	Did you not pour me out like milk 
JOB.10.10	and curdle me
JOB.10.11	You clothed me with skin and flesh, 
JOB.10.11	and you knit me together with bones and sinews. 
JOB.10.12	You have granted me life and loyal love, 
JOB.10.12	and your care has preserved my spirit. 
JOB.10.13	“ ‘Yet
JOB.10.13	I know that this was your purpose.
JOB.10.14	If I had sinned, then
JOB.10.14	and you would not acquit me of my guilt. 
JOB.10.15	If I am guilty, woe to me! 
JOB.10.15	But
JOB.10.15	I am filled with shame, and just look at my misery! 
JOB.10.16	And if my head grows bold, you would hunt me as the lion in its prime; 
JOB.10.16	and you repeat your exploits against me.
JOB.10.17	You renew your witnesses against me, 
JOB.10.17	and you increase your vexation against me; 
JOB.10.17	relief forces
JOB.10.18	So
JOB.10.18	I should have passed away, and no eye should have seen me.
JOB.10.19	I should have been as though I had not been; 
JOB.10.19	I should have been brought from the womb to the grave. 
JOB.10.20	Are not my days few? Let him leave me alone; 
JOB.10.20	let him turn from me, and let me rejoice a little. 
JOB.10.21	Before I go—and I will not return— 
JOB.10.21	to the land of darkness and deep shadow, 
JOB.10.22	to the land of darkness, 
JOB.10.22	like the darkness of a deep shadow and chaos,
JOB.10.22	so that
JOB.11.1	Then
JOB.11.2	“Should an abundance of words go unanswered, 
JOB.11.2	or a man full of talk
JOB.11.3	Should your loose talk put people to silence? 
JOB.11.3	And when you mock, shall no one put you to shame?
JOB.11.4	For you say, ‘My teaching is pure, 
JOB.11.4	and I am clean in your sight.’ 
JOB.11.5	But,
JOB.11.5	and that he would open his lips to you, 
JOB.11.6	and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom, 
JOB.11.6	for insight has many sides.
JOB.11.6	And know that God on your behalf
JOB.11.7	“Can you find out the essence of God, 
JOB.11.7	or can you find out the ultimate limits
JOB.11.8	It is higher than the heaven;
JOB.11.8	It is deeper than Sheol; what can you know? 
JOB.11.9	Its measure is longer than the earth 
JOB.11.9	and broader than the sea. 
JOB.11.10	“If he passes through and imprisons someone
JOB.11.10	and summons the assembly,
JOB.11.11	For he knows those who are worthless;
JOB.11.11	when he sees
JOB.11.12	But
JOB.11.12	when
JOB.11.13	“If you yourself
JOB.11.13	and stretch out your hands to him— 
JOB.11.14	if iniquity
JOB.11.14	and you must not let wickedness reside in your tents— 
JOB.11.15	surely then you will lift up your face without
JOB.11.15	and you will be firmly established and will not fear.
JOB.11.16	For you yourself
JOB.11.16	you will remember it as water that has flowed past. 
JOB.11.17	“And your life will be brighter than noon;
JOB.11.17	its darkness will be like the morning. 
JOB.11.18	And you will have confidence because there is hope; 
JOB.11.18	and you will be well protected—you will sleep in safety.
JOB.11.19	And you will lie down, and no one will make you afraid;
JOB.11.19	and many will entreat your favor.
JOB.11.20	But
JOB.11.20	and refuge will be lost to them, 
JOB.11.20	and their hope is to breathe their last breath.”
JOB.12.1	  Then
JOB.12.2	“Truly indeed you
JOB.12.2	and wisdom will die with you.
JOB.12.3	I also have insight
JOB.12.3	I am not more inferior than you.
JOB.12.3	And who does not know things like these?
JOB.12.4	I am a laughingstock to my friends:
JOB.12.4	‘He calls on God, and he answers him.’ 
JOB.12.4	A righteous, blameless man is a laughingstock. 
JOB.12.5	Those at ease have contempt
JOB.12.5	but it is ready for those unstable of foot. 
JOB.12.6	The tents of the destroyers are at peace, 
JOB.12.6	and there is security for those who provoke God, 
JOB.12.6	for those whom God brings into his hand.
JOB.12.7	“But
JOB.12.7	and the birds of the heaven, and they will tell you; 
JOB.12.8	or ask the earth, and it will teach you, 
JOB.12.8	and the fishes of the sea will declare to you. 
JOB.12.9	Who among all of these does not know 
JOB.12.9	that Yahweh’s hand has done this? 
JOB.12.10	In whose hand is the life of all living things 
JOB.12.10	and the breath of every human being?
JOB.12.11	Does not the ear test words 
JOB.12.11	and the palate taste food for itself? 
JOB.12.12	Wisdom is with the aged, 
JOB.12.12	and understanding is in length of days. 
JOB.12.13	“With him are wisdom and powerful deeds, 
JOB.12.13	and to him belong counsel and understanding. 
JOB.12.14	If he tears down, then
JOB.12.14	if he shuts a man in, then
JOB.12.15	Look, if he withholds the water,
JOB.12.15	and if he sends them out, then
JOB.12.16	“Strength and sound wisdom are with him; 
JOB.12.16	the deceived and the deceiver are his.
JOB.12.17	He leads counselors away stripped, 
JOB.12.17	and he makes fools of judges. 
JOB.12.18	He loosens the fetters of kings, 
JOB.12.18	and he binds a loincloth on their loins. 
JOB.12.19	He leads priests away stripped, 
JOB.12.19	and he overthrows the members of ancient families.
JOB.12.20	He deprives the trustworthy of speech, 
JOB.12.20	and he takes away the discretion of elders. 
JOB.12.21	He pours contempt on noblemen, 
JOB.12.21	and he loosens the girdle of the mighty. 
JOB.12.22	“He uncovers mysteries out of darkness, 
JOB.12.22	and he brings deep shadow to the light. 
JOB.12.23	He makes the nations great, then
JOB.12.23	he expands the nations, then
JOB.12.24	He strips away the insight of the heads of the earth’s people, 
JOB.12.24	and he makes them wander in a pathless wasteland.
JOB.12.25	They grope in the dark without
JOB.12.25	and he makes them stagger like a
JOB.13.1	“Look, my eye has seen everything; 
JOB.13.1	my ear has heard and has understood it. 
JOB.13.2	What you
JOB.13.2	I am not more inferior than you.
JOB.13.3	But I would speak to Shaddai, 
JOB.13.3	and I desire to argue with God. 
JOB.13.4	“But
JOB.13.4	all of you
JOB.13.5	O that
JOB.13.5	and that it would become wisdom for you.
JOB.13.6	Please hear my argument, 
JOB.13.6	and listen attentively to the pleadings of my lips. 
JOB.13.7	“Will you
JOB.13.7	And will you
JOB.13.8	Will you
JOB.13.8	Or do you
JOB.13.9	Will it be well, if he examines you?
JOB.13.9	Or can you
JOB.13.10	“Surely he will rebuke you
JOB.13.10	if you
JOB.13.11	Will not his majesty terrify you,
JOB.13.11	and his dread fall upon you?
JOB.13.12	Your
JOB.13.12	your
JOB.13.13	“Let me have silence,
JOB.13.13	and let come over me whatever may. 
JOB.13.14	Why should I take my flesh in my teeth 
JOB.13.14	and
JOB.13.15	Look,
JOB.13.15	however, I will defend my ways before him.
JOB.13.16	Moreover, this is salvation to me, 
JOB.13.16	that the godless would not come before him.
JOB.13.17	“Listen carefully to my words, 
JOB.13.17	and let my exposition be in your ears. 
JOB.13.18	Please look,
JOB.13.18	I know that I myself
JOB.13.19	Who is he who will contend with me? 
JOB.13.19	For then I would be silent, and I would pass away. 
JOB.13.20	“Only you
JOB.13.20	then I will not hide from your face: 
JOB.13.21	withdraw your
JOB.13.21	and let not your
JOB.13.22	Then
JOB.13.22	or let me speak, then
JOB.13.23	“How many
JOB.13.23	Make known to me my transgression and my sin. 
JOB.13.24	Why do you
JOB.13.24	and count me as your
JOB.13.25	Will you
JOB.13.25	And will you
JOB.13.26	“Indeed, you
JOB.13.26	and you
JOB.13.27	And you
JOB.13.27	and you
JOB.13.27	you carve a mark on the soles of my feet.
JOB.13.28	And he himself 
JOB.13.28	like a garment that the moth has eaten. 
JOB.14.1	“A human being born of a woman 
JOB.14.1	is short of days and full of troubles.
JOB.14.2	Like a flower he comes up, and he withers away; 
JOB.14.2	and he flees like a
JOB.14.3	Even on such a one you fix your eyes, 
JOB.14.3	and you bring me into judgment with you. 
JOB.14.4	“Who can bring a clean thing from an unclean thing? 
JOB.14.4	No one!
JOB.14.5	If his days are determined, the number of his months is with you; 
JOB.14.5	you have appointed his boundaries, and he cannot cross them. 
JOB.14.6	Look away from him, and let him desist 
JOB.14.6	until he enjoys his days like a laborer. 
JOB.14.7	“Indeed, there is hope for a tree: 
JOB.14.7	if it is cut down, then
JOB.14.7	and its new shoots will not cease; 
JOB.14.8	though its root grows old in the earth, 
JOB.14.8	and its stump dies in the dust, 
JOB.14.9	at
JOB.14.9	and it will put forth branches like a young plant. 
JOB.14.10	“But
JOB.14.10	thus
JOB.14.11	As water disappears from a lake, 
JOB.14.11	and a river withers away and dries up,
JOB.14.12	so
JOB.14.12	Until the heavens are no more,
JOB.14.12	and they will not be roused out of their sleep. 
JOB.14.13	“O that
JOB.14.13	that you would hide me until your wrath is past,
JOB.14.13	that you would appoint a set time for me and remember me. 
JOB.14.14	If a man dies, will he live again? 
JOB.14.14	All the days of my compulsory service I will wait, 
JOB.14.14	until the coming of my relief. 
JOB.14.15	You would call, and I myself
JOB.14.15	you would long for the work of your hand. 
JOB.14.16	For then
JOB.14.16	but you would not keep watch over my sin. 
JOB.14.17	My transgression would be sealed in a bag, 
JOB.14.17	and you would cover over my guilt. 
JOB.14.18	“But
JOB.14.18	and a rock moves away from its place. 
JOB.14.19	Water wears away stones; 
JOB.14.19	its torrents wash away the soil of the earth; 
JOB.14.19	so
JOB.14.20	You overpower him forever, and he passes away; 
JOB.14.20	you change his countenance,
JOB.14.21	His children may come to honor, but
JOB.14.21	or
JOB.14.22	He feels only the pain of his own body,
JOB.14.22	and his inner self
JOB.15.1	Then
JOB.15.2	“Should the wise answer with windy knowledge, 
JOB.15.2	and should he fill his stomach with the east wind? 
JOB.15.3	Should he argue in talk that is not profitable 
JOB.15.3	or in words with which he cannot do good? 
JOB.15.4	“What is worse,
JOB.15.4	and you are lessening meditation before
JOB.15.5	For your iniquity teaches your mouth, 
JOB.15.5	and you choose the tongue of the crafty. 
JOB.15.6	Your mouth condemns you, and not I; 
JOB.15.6	and your lips testify against you. 
JOB.15.7	“Were you born the firstborn of the human race? 
JOB.15.7	And were you brought forth before
JOB.15.8	Have you listened in God’s confidential discussion? 
JOB.15.8	And do you limit wisdom to yourself? 
JOB.15.9	What do you know that we do not know? 
JOB.15.9	What do you understand that is not clear to us? 
JOB.15.10	Both the gray-haired and the old are among us— 
JOB.15.10	those older than your father.
JOB.15.11	“Are the consolations of God too small for you, 
JOB.15.11	a word spoken gently with you? 
JOB.15.12	Why does your heart carry you away? 
JOB.15.12	And why do your eyes flash, 
JOB.15.13	that you turn your spirit against God, 
JOB.15.13	and you let such words go out of your mouth? 
JOB.15.14	“What is a human being, that he can be clean, 
JOB.15.14	or
JOB.15.15	Look, he does not trust his holy ones, 
JOB.15.15	and the heavens are not clean in his eyes. 
JOB.15.16	How much less
JOB.15.16	a man drinking wickedness like water. 
JOB.15.17	“I will show you, listen to me; 
JOB.15.17	and what I have seen, I will tell
JOB.15.18	what wise men have told, 
JOB.15.18	and they have not hidden that which is from their ancestors, 
JOB.15.19	to whom alone
JOB.15.19	and no stranger passed through their midst. 
JOB.15.20	“All of the wicked one’s days he is writhing, 
JOB.15.20	even
JOB.15.21	Sounds of terror are in his ears; 
JOB.15.21	in prosperity the destroyer will come against him. 
JOB.15.22	He cannot trust that he will return
JOB.15.22	and he himself
JOB.15.23	“He is wandering for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’ 
JOB.15.23	He knows that a day of darkness is ready at hand.
JOB.15.24	Anguish and distress terrify him; 
JOB.15.24	they
JOB.15.25	Because he stretched out his hand against God, 
JOB.15.25	and he was arrogant to Shaddai; 
JOB.15.26	he stubbornly
JOB.15.26	with his thick-bossed shield.
JOB.15.27	“Because he has covered his face with his fat 
JOB.15.27	and has gathered fat upon his loins, 
JOB.15.28	he will dwell
JOB.15.28	in houses that they should not inhabit, 
JOB.15.28	which are destined for rubble. 
JOB.15.29	He will not become rich, and his wealth will not endure, 
JOB.15.29	and their possessions will not stretch across the earth.
JOB.15.30	“He will not escape from darkness; 
JOB.15.30	a flame will dry up his new shoot, 
JOB.15.30	and by the wind of his mouth he shall be removed. 
JOB.15.31	Let him not trust in emptiness—he will be deceiving himself— 
JOB.15.31	for worthlessness will be his recompense. 
JOB.15.32	It will be paid in full before his time,
JOB.15.32	and his branch will not flourish. 
JOB.15.33	“He will shake off his unripe fruit like the vine, 
JOB.15.33	and he will cast off his blossom like the olive tree; 
JOB.15.34	for the company of the godless is barren, 
JOB.15.34	and fire consumes the tents of those who accept bribes. 
JOB.15.35	They conceive trouble and bring forth mischief, 
JOB.15.35	and their womb prepares deceit.” 
JOB.16.1	Then
JOB.16.2	“I have heard many things like these; 
JOB.16.2	all of you are miserable comforters.
JOB.16.3	Is there a limit to windy words? 
JOB.16.3	What provokes you that you answer? 
JOB.16.4	I myself
JOB.16.4	if you were in my place;
JOB.16.4	I could join against you with words, 
JOB.16.4	and I could shake at you with my head. 
JOB.16.5	I could
JOB.16.5	and the solace of my lips would
JOB.16.6	If I speak, my pain is not relieved; 
JOB.16.6	and if I cease, how much will leave me? 
JOB.16.7	“Surely now he has worn me out; 
JOB.16.7	you
JOB.16.8	Thus
JOB.16.8	it became a witness. 
JOB.16.8	And my leanness has risen up against me; 
JOB.16.8	it testifies to my face. 
JOB.16.9	His wrath has torn, and he has been hostile toward me; 
JOB.16.9	he gnashed at me with his teeth. 
JOB.16.9	My foe sharpens his eyes against me. 
JOB.16.10	They gaped at me with their mouth; 
JOB.16.10	they struck my cheeks with disgrace; 
JOB.16.10	they have massed themselves together against me. 
JOB.16.11	God delivers me to an evil one, 
JOB.16.11	and he casts me into the hands of the wicked. 
JOB.16.12	“I was at ease, then
JOB.16.12	and he seized me by my neck; 
JOB.16.12	then
JOB.16.12	and set me up as a target for him. 
JOB.16.13	His archers surround me; 
JOB.16.13	he slashes open my kidneys, and he does not have compassion; 
JOB.16.13	he pours out my gall on the ground. 
JOB.16.14	He breached me breach upon breach;
JOB.16.14	he rushes at me like a warrior. 
JOB.16.15	“I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, 
JOB.16.15	and I have inserted my pride
JOB.16.16	My face is red because of weeping, 
JOB.16.16	and deep shadows are on my eyelids, 
JOB.16.17	although
JOB.16.17	and my prayer is pure. 
JOB.16.18	“O earth, you should not cover my blood, 
JOB.16.18	and let there be no place
JOB.16.19	So now look, my witness is in the heavens, 
JOB.16.19	and he who vouches for me is in the heights. 
JOB.16.20	My friends scorn me; 
JOB.16.20	my eye pours out tears to God, 
JOB.16.21	and it argues
JOB.16.21	and as a human
JOB.16.22	Indeed, after a few years
JOB.16.22	then
JOB.17.1	“My spirit is pulled down; my days are extinguished; 
JOB.17.1	the graveyard is for me. 
JOB.17.2	Surely
JOB.17.2	and my eye rests
JOB.17.3	Please lay down a pledge for me with yourself; 
JOB.17.3	who is he who will give security for my hand?
JOB.17.4	Indeed,
JOB.17.4	therefore, you will not let them triumph. 
JOB.17.5	He denounces friends for reward, 
JOB.17.5	so
JOB.17.6	“And he has made me a proverb for
JOB.17.6	and I am one before whom people spit.
JOB.17.7	And my eye has grown dim from grief, 
JOB.17.7	and the limbs of my body are all
JOB.17.8	The upright are appalled at this, 
JOB.17.8	and the innocent excites himself over the godless. 
JOB.17.9	But
JOB.17.9	and he who has clean hands
JOB.17.10	But
JOB.17.10	But
JOB.17.11	“My days are past; my plans are broken down— 
JOB.17.11	even the desires of my heart. 
JOB.17.12	They make night into day, 
JOB.17.12	saying, ‘Light is near to darkness.’
JOB.17.13	If I hope for Sheol as my house, 
JOB.17.13	if I spread my couch in the darkness, 
JOB.17.14	if I call to the pit, ‘You are my father,’ 
JOB.17.14	to the maggot, ‘You are my mother or
JOB.17.15	where
JOB.17.15	And who will see my hope?
JOB.17.16	Will they go down to the bars of Sheol? 
JOB.17.16	Or shall we descend together into the dust?” 
JOB.18.1	Then
JOB.18.2	“How long
JOB.18.2	Consider,
JOB.18.3	Why are we considered as animals? 
JOB.18.3	Why are we taken as
JOB.18.4	“You who are tearing yourself
JOB.18.4	will the earth be forsaken because of you?
JOB.18.4	Or
JOB.18.5	Furthermore,
JOB.18.5	and the flame of his fire will not shine. 
JOB.18.6	The light becomes dark in his tent, 
JOB.18.6	and his lamp above him is put out. 
JOB.18.7	“His strong steps
JOB.18.7	and his own schemes
JOB.18.8	for he is thrust into a net by his feet, 
JOB.18.8	and he walks into a pitfall. 
JOB.18.9	A trap seizes him by the heel; 
JOB.18.9	a snare takes hold of him. 
JOB.18.10	His rope is hidden in the ground, 
JOB.18.10	and his trap on the path. 
JOB.18.11	“Sudden terrors terrify him all around, 
JOB.18.11	and they chase him at his heels. 
JOB.18.12	His wealth will become hunger, 
JOB.18.12	and disaster is ready for his stumbling. 
JOB.18.13	It consumes parts of his skin; 
JOB.18.13	the firstborn of death consumes his limbs. 
JOB.18.14	He is torn from his tent in which he trusted,
JOB.18.14	and it brought him to the king of terrors. 
JOB.18.15	“Nothing
JOB.18.15	sulfur is scattered upon his dwelling place. 
JOB.18.16	His roots dry up below,
JOB.18.16	and its branches
JOB.18.17	His remembrance perishes from the earth, 
JOB.18.17	and there is not a name for him on the street. 
JOB.18.18	“They thrust him from light into darkness, 
JOB.18.18	and they drive him out from the world. 
JOB.18.19	There is no offspring for him nor
JOB.18.19	and there is not a survivor in his abode. 
JOB.18.20	Those of the west are appalled over his fate,
JOB.18.20	and those of the east are seized with horror.
JOB.18.21	Surely these are the dwellings of the godless, 
JOB.18.21	and this is the dwelling place of him who knows not God.” 
JOB.19.1	  Then
JOB.19.2	“How long
JOB.19.2	and crush me with words? 
JOB.19.3	These ten times you
JOB.19.3	you
JOB.19.4	And what is more, if I have truly erred, 
JOB.19.4	my error remains with me. 
JOB.19.5	If indeed you
JOB.19.5	and you
JOB.19.6	know then that God has wronged me 
JOB.19.6	and has surrounded me with his net. 
JOB.19.7	“Look, I cry out, ‘Violence!’ but
JOB.19.7	I cry out, but
JOB.19.8	He has walled up my way so that
JOB.19.8	and he has set darkness upon my paths. 
JOB.19.9	He has taken my glory from me, 
JOB.19.9	and he has removed the crown of
JOB.19.10	He has broken me down all around, and I am gone. 
JOB.19.10	And he has uprooted my hope like a tree, 
JOB.19.11	and he has kindled his wrath against me, 
JOB.19.11	and he has counted me as one of his foes.
JOB.19.12	His troops have come together 
JOB.19.12	and have thrown up their rampart
JOB.19.12	and have encamped around my tent. 
JOB.19.13	“He has removed my kinsfolk from me, 
JOB.19.13	and my acquaintances have only
JOB.19.14	My relatives have failed, 
JOB.19.14	and my close friends have forgotten me. 
JOB.19.15	The sojourners in
JOB.19.15	I have become a foreigner in their eyes. 
JOB.19.16	I call to my servant, but
JOB.19.16	I must personally
JOB.19.17	My breath is repulsive to my wife, 
JOB.19.17	and I am loathsome to my own family.
JOB.19.18	Little boys also despise me; 
JOB.19.18	when I rise, then
JOB.19.19	All my intimate friends
JOB.19.19	and these whom I have loved have turned against me. 
JOB.19.20	My bones
JOB.19.20	and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth. 
JOB.19.21	“Pity me, pity me, you my friends, 
JOB.19.21	for God’s hand has touched me. 
JOB.19.22	Why do you
JOB.19.22	And are not satisfied with my flesh? 
JOB.19.23	“O that
JOB.19.23	O that they could be inscribed in a scroll!
JOB.19.24	That with a pen of iron and with lead 
JOB.19.24	they might be engraved on a rock forever! 
JOB.19.25	But
JOB.19.25	and at the last he will stand up upon the earth.
JOB.19.26	And after my skin has been thus destroyed, 
JOB.19.26	but
JOB.19.27	whom I will see for myself,
JOB.19.27	and whom my eyes will see and not a stranger.
JOB.19.27	My heart faints within me.
JOB.19.28	“If you
JOB.19.28	And ‘The root of the trouble is found’ in me,
JOB.19.29	be afraid for yourselves because of the sword,
JOB.19.29	for wrath brings punishment by
JOB.19.29	so that you may know that there is judgment.” 
JOB.20.1	  Then
JOB.20.2	“Therefore my disquieting thoughts bring me back 
JOB.20.2	for the sake of
JOB.20.3	I hear discipline that insults me, 
JOB.20.3	and a spirit beyond my understanding answers me. 
JOB.20.4	“Did you
JOB.20.4	since the setting of the human being on earth, 
JOB.20.5	that the rejoicing of the wicked is short,
JOB.20.5	and the joy of the godless lasts only a moment?
JOB.20.6	Even though his stature mounts up to the heaven, 
JOB.20.6	and his head reaches to the clouds, 
JOB.20.7	he will perish forever like his dung; 
JOB.20.7	those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’ 
JOB.20.8	He will fly away like a dream, and they will not find him, 
JOB.20.8	and he will be chased away like a vision of the night. 
JOB.20.9	The eye that saw him will not see him again,
JOB.20.9	and his place will no longer behold him. 
JOB.20.10	His children will seek favors from the poor, 
JOB.20.10	and his hands will return his wealth. 
JOB.20.11	His bones were full of his vigor, 
JOB.20.11	but
JOB.20.12	“Though wickedness tastes sweet in his mouth, 
JOB.20.12	and he hides it under his tongue, 
JOB.20.13	though he spares it and does not let it go 
JOB.20.13	and holds it back in the midst of his palate, 
JOB.20.14	in his bowels his food is turned, 
JOB.20.14	the venom of horned vipers is within him.
JOB.20.15	He swallows riches, but
JOB.20.15	God drives them
JOB.20.16	He will suck the poison of horned vipers; 
JOB.20.16	the viper’s tongue will kill him. 
JOB.20.17	He will not enjoy the streams,
JOB.20.17	the torrents of honey and curds. 
JOB.20.18	Returning the products of his toil, he will not swallow;
JOB.20.18	according to the profit of his trade, he will not enjoy,
JOB.20.19	for he has oppressed; he has abandoned the poor; 
JOB.20.19	he has seized a house but
JOB.20.20	Because he has not known satisfaction in his stomach, 
JOB.20.20	he lets nothing escape that he desires.
JOB.20.21	There is nothing left after he has eaten;
JOB.20.21	therefore his prosperity will not endure. 
JOB.20.22	In the fullness of his excess he will be in distress;
JOB.20.22	all of misery’s power will come upon him. 
JOB.20.23	When his stomach fills up,
JOB.20.23	and he will let it rain down upon him
JOB.20.24	“He will flee from an iron weapon, 
JOB.20.24	but an arrow of bronze will pierce him. 
JOB.20.25	He draws it forth, and it comes out from his body, 
JOB.20.25	and the glittering point comes from his gall-bladder; 
JOB.20.25	terrors come upon him. 
JOB.20.26	Total darkness
JOB.20.26	an unfanned fire
JOB.20.26	the remnant
JOB.20.27	The heavens will reveal his guilt, 
JOB.20.27	and the earth will rise up against him. 
JOB.20.28	The products of his house will be carried away
JOB.20.28	like gushing waters
JOB.20.29	This is a wicked human being’s portion from God 
JOB.20.29	and the inheritance of his decree from God.”
JOB.21.1	Then
JOB.21.2	“Listen carefully to my words, 
JOB.21.2	and let this be your
JOB.21.3	Bear with me, and I myself
JOB.21.3	then
JOB.21.4	As for me, is my complaint for human beings? 
JOB.21.4	And if so, why cannot I be impatient? 
JOB.21.5	Turn to me and be appalled, 
JOB.21.5	and place your hand on your mouth. 
JOB.21.6	And when I think of it, I am horrified,
JOB.21.6	and shuddering seizes my flesh. 
JOB.21.7	“Why do the wicked live, 
JOB.21.7	grow old, even grow mighty in power? 
JOB.21.8	With them their offspring are established before them,
JOB.21.8	and their descendants before their eyes. 
JOB.21.9	Their houses are safe without fear, 
JOB.21.9	and the rod of God is not upon them. 
JOB.21.10	His bull breeds and does not fail; 
JOB.21.10	his cow calves and does not miscarry. 
JOB.21.11	They send out their little ones like the flock, 
JOB.21.11	and their children dance around. 
JOB.21.12	They sing
JOB.21.12	and they rejoice to the sound of the long flute. 
JOB.21.13	They spend their days in prosperity, 
JOB.21.13	and in peace they go down to Sheol. 
JOB.21.14	And they say to God, ‘Turn away from us, 
JOB.21.14	for
JOB.21.15	Who is Shaddai that we should serve him, 
JOB.21.15	or
JOB.21.16	Look, their prosperity is not in their hands; 
JOB.21.16	the schemes of the wicked are repugnant
JOB.21.17	“How often is the lamp of the wicked put out, 
JOB.21.17	and their disaster comes upon them? 
JOB.21.17	He
JOB.21.18	How often are they like straw before
JOB.21.18	and like chaff that the storm carries away? 
JOB.21.19	‘God stores up his iniquity for his children’?
JOB.21.19	Then let him repay it to him that
JOB.21.20	Let his eyes see his decay, 
JOB.21.20	and let him drink from the wrath of Shaddai, 
JOB.21.21	for what does he care for
JOB.21.21	when the number of his months is
JOB.21.22	Can anyone teach knowledge to God, 
JOB.21.22	since
JOB.21.23	This one dies in full prosperity,
JOB.21.23	completely
JOB.21.24	His vats are full with milk 
JOB.21.24	and the marrow of his bones is moist. 
JOB.21.25	Yet
JOB.21.25	and has not tasted prosperity. 
JOB.21.26	They lie down together in the dust, 
JOB.21.26	and maggots cover them. 
JOB.21.27	“Look, I know your
JOB.21.27	and the schemes you devise against me. 
JOB.21.28	For you say, ‘Where is the nobleman’s house, 
JOB.21.28	and where are the tents in which the wicked dwell?’
JOB.21.29	Do you not ask those traveling the roads, 
JOB.21.29	and do you not take notice of their accounts? 
JOB.21.30	Indeed, the wicked is spared from the day of disaster; 
JOB.21.30	he is delivered from the day of wrath. 
JOB.21.31	Who denounces his way to his face? 
JOB.21.31	And who repays him for what he has done? 
JOB.21.32	When
JOB.21.32	then
JOB.21.33	The clods of the valley are sweet to him; 
JOB.21.33	everyone will follow after him, 
JOB.21.33	and before
JOB.21.34	So
JOB.21.34	when
JOB.22.1	Then
JOB.22.2	“Can a man be of use to God? 
JOB.22.2	Yes, can the wise be of use to him? 
JOB.22.3	Is it a pleasure to Shaddai if you are righteous, 
JOB.22.3	or
JOB.22.4	Does he reprove you because of your reverence 
JOB.22.4	or enter into judgment with you? 
JOB.22.5	Is not your wickedness great, 
JOB.22.5	and there is no end to your iniquities? 
JOB.22.6	“Indeed, you have required a pledge from your family for nothing, 
JOB.22.6	and you have stripped off the clothes of the naked. 
JOB.22.7	You have given no water for the weary to drink, 
JOB.22.7	and you withheld food from the hungry. 
JOB.22.8	And the land belongs to the man of power,
JOB.22.8	and the favored
JOB.22.9	You have sent widows away empty-handed, 
JOB.22.9	and the arms of orphans were crushed. 
JOB.22.10	Therefore trapping nets are all around you, 
JOB.22.10	and panic suddenly terrifies you, 
JOB.22.11	or it is so dark you cannot see, 
JOB.22.11	and a flood of water covers you. 
JOB.22.12	“Is not God in the height of the heavens? 
JOB.22.12	But
JOB.22.13	And you ask, ‘What does God know? 
JOB.22.13	Can he judge through deep gloom? 
JOB.22.14	Thick clouds are a covering for him, so that he does not see; 
JOB.22.14	and he walks about on the dome of heaven.’ 
JOB.22.15	Will you keep to the way of old 
JOB.22.15	that the people of mischief have trod, 
JOB.22.16	who were snatched away before their time,
JOB.22.16	whose foundation was washed away by a current? 
JOB.22.17	Those who said to God, ‘Turn away from us,’ 
JOB.22.17	and ‘What can Shaddai do to us?’ 
JOB.22.18	Yet
JOB.22.18	but
JOB.22.19	The righteous see, and they rejoice, 
JOB.22.19	but
JOB.22.20	Surely
JOB.22.20	and fire has consumed their remainder.
JOB.22.21	“Please reconcile yourself with him, 
JOB.22.21	and be at peace; in this way,
JOB.22.22	Please receive instruction from his mouth, 
JOB.22.22	and place his words in your heart. 
JOB.22.23	If you return to Shaddai, you will be restored; 
JOB.22.23	if you remove wickedness from your tent, 
JOB.22.24	and if you put gold ore in the dust, 
JOB.22.24	and the gold of Ophir in the rock of wadis, 
JOB.22.25	then
JOB.22.25	and your precious silver.
JOB.22.26	Indeed, then you will delight yourself in Shaddai, 
JOB.22.26	and you will expect that God will be good to you.
JOB.22.27	You will pray to him, and he will hear you, 
JOB.22.27	and you will pay your vows. 
JOB.22.28	And you will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, 
JOB.22.28	and light will shine on your ways. 
JOB.22.29	When they are humiliated, you say,
JOB.22.29	for
JOB.22.30	He will deliver the guilty, 
JOB.22.30	and he will escape because of the cleanness of your hands.” 
JOB.23.1	Then
JOB.23.2	“Even today my complaint is bitter; 
JOB.23.2	my hand is heavy in addition to my groaning. 
JOB.23.3	O that
JOB.23.3	O that I might come to his dwelling. 
JOB.23.4	I would lay my case before him,
JOB.23.4	and I would fill my mouth with arguments. 
JOB.23.5	I want to know the words with which he would answer me, 
JOB.23.5	and I want to understand what he would say to me. 
JOB.23.6	Would he contend with me in the greatness of his strength? 
JOB.23.6	No, but he himself
JOB.23.7	There an upright person could reason with him, 
JOB.23.7	and I would be acquitted forever by my judge. 
JOB.23.8	“When I go forward, he is not there,
JOB.23.8	or
JOB.23.9	When he works
JOB.23.9	he turns to the right, but
JOB.23.10	But he knows the way that I take;
JOB.23.10	he tests me—I shall come out like gold. 
JOB.23.11	My foot has held on to his steps; 
JOB.23.11	I have kept his way, and I have not turned aside. 
JOB.23.12	From the commandment of his lips, indeed
JOB.23.12	I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily food. 
JOB.23.13	“But
JOB.23.13	And whatever he desires,
JOB.23.14	For he will carry out what he appoints for me,
JOB.23.14	and many things like these are with him. 
JOB.23.15	Therefore, I am horrified because of his presence; 
JOB.23.15	when I consider, I tremble
JOB.23.16	Indeed,
JOB.23.16	and Shaddai has terrified me. 
JOB.23.17	Indeed, I have not been silenced because of darkness,
JOB.23.17	and because of me he
JOB.24.1	“Why are not times kept by Shaddai, 
JOB.24.1	and why do not those who know him see his days? 
JOB.24.2	They
JOB.24.2	they seize flocks, and they pasture them. 
JOB.24.3	They drive away the donkey of orphans; 
JOB.24.3	they take the widow’s ox as a pledge. 
JOB.24.4	They thrust the poor off the road; 
JOB.24.4	the needy of the earth hide themselves together.
JOB.24.5	“Look, like wild donkeys in the desert 
JOB.24.5	they
JOB.24.5	the wilderness is
JOB.24.6	They reap their
JOB.24.6	and they glean in the vineyard of the wicked. 
JOB.24.7	They spend the night naked, without
JOB.24.7	and they have no garment in the cold. 
JOB.24.8	They are wet from the rainstorm of the mountains,
JOB.24.8	and they cling to the rock without
JOB.24.9	“They
JOB.24.9	and they take a pledge against the needy.
JOB.24.10	They
JOB.24.10	and hungry, they carry the sheaves.
JOB.24.11	Between their terraces they press out oil; 
JOB.24.11	they tread the presses, but
JOB.24.12	From the city people groan, 
JOB.24.12	and the throat
JOB.24.12	yet
JOB.24.13	“Those are among the ones rebelling against the light; 
JOB.24.13	they do not recognize his ways, 
JOB.24.13	and they do not stay in his paths. 
JOB.24.14	At dusk
JOB.24.14	he kills the needy and the poor, 
JOB.24.14	and in the night he is like a
JOB.24.15	And the eye of the adulterer waits for dusk, 
JOB.24.15	saying, ‘No eye will see me,’
JOB.24.15	and he places a covering on his face. 
JOB.24.16	He digs through houses in the darkness; 
JOB.24.16	by day they shut themselves in— 
JOB.24.16	they do not know the light 
JOB.24.17	because morning likewise is to them deep darkness; 
JOB.24.17	indeed, they know about the terrors of deep darkness. 
JOB.24.18	“He himself
JOB.24.18	their portion is cursed in the land. 
JOB.24.18	No one turns toward the path of their vineyards.
JOB.24.19	Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters, 
JOB.24.19	like Sheol snatches away those
JOB.24.20	The womb forgets him. 
JOB.24.20	The maggot feasts on him until he is no longer remembered, 
JOB.24.20	and wickedness is broken like a
JOB.24.21	He feeds on the barren, who does not have a child, 
JOB.24.21	and does no good to the widow. 
JOB.24.22	Yet
JOB.24.22	if he rises up, then
JOB.24.23	He
JOB.24.23	but
JOB.24.24	They are exalted a little while, then
JOB.24.24	And they are brought low; they are cut off like all others, 
JOB.24.24	and like the heads of grain they wither away. 
JOB.24.25	“And if it is not so, then who can prove me a liar 
JOB.24.25	and reduce my word to nothing?” 
JOB.25.1	Then
JOB.25.2	“Domination and dread are with him 
JOB.25.2	who makes peace in his high heavens. 
JOB.25.3	Is there a number to his troops? 
JOB.25.3	And upon whom does his light not rise? 
JOB.25.4	“Indeed,
JOB.25.4	And how will he who is born of a woman be pure? 
JOB.25.5	Look, even the moon is not bright,
JOB.25.5	and the stars are not pure in his sight. 
JOB.25.6	How much less
JOB.25.6	and a human
JOB.26.1	Then
JOB.26.2	“How you
JOB.26.2	How you
JOB.26.3	How you
JOB.26.3	And what sound wisdom you
JOB.26.4	With whose help
JOB.26.4	and whose breath has come forth from you?
JOB.26.5	“The spirits of the dead tremble 
JOB.26.5	below the waters and their inhabitants. 
JOB.26.6	Sheol is naked before him, 
JOB.26.6	and there is no covering for Abaddon. 
JOB.26.7	He stretches out the north over emptiness; 
JOB.26.7	he hangs the earth over nothing.
JOB.26.8	He ties up the water in its clouds, 
JOB.26.8	and the cloud is not torn open beneath it.
JOB.26.9	He covers the face of the full moon;
JOB.26.9	he spreads his cloud over it. 
JOB.26.10	He has described a circle
JOB.26.10	between light and darkness.
JOB.26.11	“The pillars of heaven tremble, 
JOB.26.11	and they are astounded at his rebuke. 
JOB.26.12	By his power he stilled the sea, 
JOB.26.12	and by his understanding he struck down Rahab. 
JOB.26.13	By his breath the heavens were made clear;
JOB.26.13	his hand pierced the fleeing snake. 
JOB.26.14	Look, these are the outer fringes of his ways, 
JOB.26.14	and how faint is the word
JOB.26.14	But
JOB.27.1	Then
JOB.27.2	“As God lives,
JOB.27.2	and Shaddai has made my inner self
JOB.27.3	For as long as
JOB.27.3	and the spirit of God is in my nose, 
JOB.27.4	my lips surely will not speak falseness, 
JOB.27.4	and my tongue surely will not utter deceit. 
JOB.27.5	Far be it from me that I would say that you
JOB.27.5	until I pass away, I will not put away from me my blamelessness. 
JOB.27.6	I hold fast to my righteousness, and I will not let it go; 
JOB.27.6	my heart will not blame any of my days. 
JOB.27.7	“Let my enemy be like the wicked 
JOB.27.7	and my opponent like the unrighteous, 
JOB.27.8	for what is the hope of the godless when he cuts them off, 
JOB.27.8	when God takes away his life? 
JOB.27.9	Will God hear his cry of distress 
JOB.27.9	when distress comes upon him? 
JOB.27.10	Or, in Shaddai will he find delight? 
JOB.27.10	Will he call upon God at all times? 
JOB.27.11	“I will teach you
JOB.27.11	I will not conceal that which is with Shaddai. 
JOB.27.12	Look, you all have seen, 
JOB.27.12	and why in the world
JOB.27.13	“This is the portion of the wicked human being with God, 
JOB.27.13	and they receive from Shaddai the inheritance of the ruthless. 
JOB.27.14	If their children multiply, it is for the sword, 
JOB.27.14	and his offspring do not have enough to eat.
JOB.27.15	Their
JOB.27.15	and their
JOB.27.16	If he heaps up silver like the dust 
JOB.27.16	and fashions clothing like the clay, 
JOB.27.17	he makes it ready, and the righteous will wear it, 
JOB.27.17	and the innocent will divide the silver. 
JOB.27.18	“He builds his house like the moth, 
JOB.27.18	and like a booth that a watchman has made. 
JOB.27.19	He goes to bed with wealth, but
JOB.27.19	he opens his eyes, and it is gone.
JOB.27.20	Terrors overtake him like the water; 
JOB.27.20	a storm wind carries him off in the night. 
JOB.27.21	The east wind lifts him up, and he is gone, 
JOB.27.21	and it sweeps him away from his place. 
JOB.27.22	And it hurls at him, and it has no compassion; 
JOB.27.22	he will quickly flee from its power. 
JOB.27.23	It claps its hands over him, 
JOB.27.23	and it hisses at him from its place. 
JOB.28.1	“Indeed, there is a mine for silver 
JOB.28.1	and a place for gold to be refined.
JOB.28.2	Iron is taken from dust, 
JOB.28.2	and he pours out copper from ore. 
JOB.28.3	He puts an end to darkness, 
JOB.28.3	and he searches out the farthest limits 
JOB.28.3	for the ore in gloom and deep shadow. 
JOB.28.4	He breaks open a mine shaft away from where people dwell;
JOB.28.4	those who are forgotten by travelers,
JOB.28.4	they dangle, they sway far away from human beings. 
JOB.28.5	As for the earth, from it comes food,
JOB.28.5	but
JOB.28.6	Its stones are the place of sapphire, 
JOB.28.6	and the earthen dirt has
JOB.28.7	“It is a path a bird of prey does not know 
JOB.28.7	and the black kite’s eye has not seen. 
JOB.28.8	Proud wild animals
JOB.28.8	the lion in its prime has not prowled over it. 
JOB.28.9	He puts his hand on the hard rock; 
JOB.28.9	he overturns mountains by the roots. 
JOB.28.10	He cuts out tunnels in the rocks, 
JOB.28.10	and his eye sees every treasure. 
JOB.28.11	He dams up rivers from their sources, 
JOB.28.11	and he brings secret things to the light. 
JOB.28.12	“But
JOB.28.12	And where in the world
JOB.28.13	A human being does not know its proper value, 
JOB.28.13	and it is not found in the land of the living. 
JOB.28.14	The deep says, ‘It is not in me,’ 
JOB.28.14	and the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’ 
JOB.28.15	“Refined gold cannot be gotten in its place, 
JOB.28.15	and silver cannot be weighed out as its price. 
JOB.28.16	It cannot be bought for the gold of Ophir, 
JOB.28.16	for precious onyx or
JOB.28.17	Gold and glass cannot be compared with it, 
JOB.28.17	and its substitution cannot be an ornament of refined gold. 
JOB.28.18	Black corals and crystal will not be mentioned, 
JOB.28.18	and wisdom’s price is more than red corals. 
JOB.28.19	The topaz of Cush cannot be compared with it; 
JOB.28.19	it cannot be bought for pure gold. 
JOB.28.20	Indeed,
JOB.28.20	And where in the world
JOB.28.21	It is hidden from the eyes of all living, 
JOB.28.21	and it is concealed from the birds of the heaven. 
JOB.28.22	Abaddon and Death say, 
JOB.28.22	‘We heard its rumor with our ears.’ 
JOB.28.23	“God understands its way, 
JOB.28.23	and he knows its place, 
JOB.28.24	for he himself
JOB.28.24	he sees under all the heaven. 
JOB.28.25	When he gave
JOB.28.25	and he apportioned the waters by measure, 
JOB.28.26	when he made
JOB.28.26	and a way for the thunder’s lightning bolt, 
JOB.28.27	then he saw it and talked about it; 
JOB.28.27	he established it, and moreover, he explored it. 
JOB.28.28	And to the human beings he said, 
JOB.28.28	‘Look, the fear of the Lord is wisdom, 
JOB.28.28	and to depart from evil is understanding.’ ” 
JOB.29.1	Then
JOB.29.2	“O that I were
JOB.29.2	as in the days when God watched over me, 
JOB.29.3	when his shining lamp was over my head— 
JOB.29.3	by his light I walked through darkness— 
JOB.29.4	as when I was in the days of my prime, 
JOB.29.4	when God’s confiding was over my house,
JOB.29.5	when Shaddaiwas still with me, 
JOB.29.5	my children were all around me, 
JOB.29.6	when my paths were washed in sour milk, 
JOB.29.6	and the rock poured out streams of oil for me. 
JOB.29.7	“At my going out the gate to the city, 
JOB.29.7	I secured my seat in the square. 
JOB.29.8	Young men saw me and stepped aside, 
JOB.29.8	and the aged rose up and stood. 
JOB.29.9	Officials refrained from talking, 
JOB.29.9	and they laid their hand on their mouth. 
JOB.29.10	The voices
JOB.29.10	and their tongue stuck to their palate. 
JOB.29.11	“When the ear heard and commended me, 
JOB.29.11	and the eye saw and testified in support of me 
JOB.29.12	because I saved the needy who cried for help, 
JOB.29.12	and I saved
JOB.29.13	The blessing of the wretched came upon me, 
JOB.29.13	and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy. 
JOB.29.14	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; 
JOB.29.14	my justice was like a robe and a headband. 
JOB.29.15	“I was eyes to the blind, 
JOB.29.15	and I was feet to the lame. 
JOB.29.16	I was a father to the poor, 
JOB.29.16	and I investigated the stranger’s
JOB.29.17	And I broke the evil one’s jaw bones, 
JOB.29.17	and I made his prey drop from his teeth. 
JOB.29.18	“And I thought, ‘I will pass away in my nest, 
JOB.29.18	and like the phoenix I shall multiply my days. 
JOB.29.19	My roots were open to water, 
JOB.29.19	and dew spent the night on my branches; 
JOB.29.20	My glory was new with me, 
JOB.29.20	and I was revitalized regularly.’
JOB.29.21	“They listened to me and waited, 
JOB.29.21	and they kept silent for my counsel. 
JOB.29.22	After my word, they did not speak again, 
JOB.29.22	and my word dropped down like dew upon them. 
JOB.29.23	And they waited for me as for the rain, 
JOB.29.23	and they opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain. 
JOB.29.24	I smiled for them when they had no confidence in anything, 
JOB.29.24	and they did not extinguish the light of my face. 
JOB.29.25	I chose their way, and I sat as head, 
JOB.29.25	and I dwelled like a king among the troops, 
JOB.29.25	like one who comforts mourners. 
JOB.30.1	“But now those younger than I, as far as days, laugh at me, 
JOB.30.1	whose fathers I rejected for setting with the dogs of my sheep and goats. 
JOB.30.2	Moreover, what use to me is the strength of their hands?
JOB.30.2	With them, vigor is destroyed. 
JOB.30.3	Through want and through barren hunger 
JOB.30.3	they are gnawing in the dry region in the darkness of desolation and waste. 
JOB.30.4	They are picking salt herbs, the leaves of bushes, 
JOB.30.4	and the roots of broom trees to warm themselves. 
JOB.30.5	They were driven out from fellow people; 
JOB.30.5	they shout at them as at a
JOB.30.6	so that they dwell
JOB.30.6	in holes of the ground and in the rocks. 
JOB.30.7	They bray among the bushes; 
JOB.30.7	they are gathered under the nettles. 
JOB.30.8	A senseless crowd,
JOB.30.8	they were cast out from the land. 
JOB.30.9	“But now I am their mocking song, 
JOB.30.9	and I have become a byword for them. 
JOB.30.10	They abhor me; they keep aloof from me, 
JOB.30.10	and they do not withhold spit from my face 
JOB.30.11	because he has loosened his bowstring and humbled me, 
JOB.30.11	and they have thrown off restraint in my presence.
JOB.30.12	On the right hand the brood rises
JOB.30.12	they put me to flight,
JOB.30.12	and they build up their siege ramps
JOB.30.13	They destroy my path; 
JOB.30.13	they promote my destruction; 
JOB.30.13	they have no helper. 
JOB.30.14	As through a wide breach they come; 
JOB.30.14	amid a crash they rush on. 
JOB.30.15	Terrors are turned upon me; 
JOB.30.15	my honor is pursued as by the wind, 
JOB.30.15	and my hope of deliverance passed by like a cloud. 
JOB.30.16	“And now my life is poured out onto me; 
JOB.30.16	days of misery have taken hold of me. 
JOB.30.17	At night I am in great pain;
JOB.30.17	my pains do not take a rest. 
JOB.30.18	He seizes my clothing with great power;
JOB.30.18	he grasps me by my tunic’s collar. 
JOB.30.19	He has cast me into the dirt, 
JOB.30.19	and I have become like dust
JOB.30.20	I cry to you for help, but
JOB.30.20	I stand, and you merely look at me. 
JOB.30.21	You have turned cruel to me; 
JOB.30.21	you persecute me with your hand’s might. 
JOB.30.22	You lift me up to the wind—you make me ride it, 
JOB.30.22	and you toss me about in the storm. 
JOB.30.23	Indeed, I know that you will bring me to death 
JOB.30.23	and to the house of assembly for all the living. 
JOB.30.24	“Surely someone must not send a hand against the needy 
JOB.30.24	when, in his misfortune, there is a cry of help for them. 
JOB.30.25	Have I not wept for the unfortunate,
JOB.30.25	and grieved myself over the poor? 
JOB.30.26	Indeed, I hoped for good, but evil came, 
JOB.30.26	and I waited for light, but darkness came. 
JOB.30.27	My bowels are in turmoil, and they are not still; 
JOB.30.27	days of misery come to confront me. 
JOB.30.28	I go about in mourning garb, but not in sunlight; 
JOB.30.28	I stand up in the assembly, and I cry for help. 
JOB.30.29	I am a companion for the jackals 
JOB.30.29	and a companion for ostriches.
JOB.30.30	My skin turns black on me, 
JOB.30.30	and my bones burn with heat. 
JOB.30.31	So
JOB.30.31	and my flute for the voice of those who weep. 
JOB.31.1	“I made a covenant with my eyes, 
JOB.31.1	so
JOB.31.2	And what is the portion of God from above 
JOB.31.2	or
JOB.31.3	Is not disaster for the evil one 
JOB.31.3	and ruin for the workers of mischief? 
JOB.31.4	Does he not see my ways 
JOB.31.4	and count all my steps? 
JOB.31.5	“If I have walked with falseness, 
JOB.31.5	and my foot has hastened to deceit, 
JOB.31.6	let him weigh me in the balance of justice, 
JOB.31.6	and let God know my blamelessness. 
JOB.31.7	If my steps have turned aside from the way, 
JOB.31.7	and my heart has walked after my eyes, 
JOB.31.7	and my hand has clung to a spot, 
JOB.31.8	let me sow, and let another eat, 
JOB.31.8	and let my crops be rooted out. 
JOB.31.9	“If my heart has been enticed by a woman, 
JOB.31.9	and at my neighbor’s doorway I have lain in wait, 
JOB.31.10	let my wife grind for another, 
JOB.31.10	and let other men kneel over her, 
JOB.31.11	for that is a shameful act, 
JOB.31.11	and that is a criminal offense.
JOB.31.12	Indeed, that is a fire that will consume up to Abaddon, 
JOB.31.12	and it would uproot all my crop. 
JOB.31.13	“If I have rejected my male or
JOB.31.13	when their complaint was against me, 
JOB.31.14	then
JOB.31.14	And when he enquires, how shall I answer him? 
JOB.31.15	Did not he who made me in the womb make them? 
JOB.31.15	And did not one fashion us in the womb? 
JOB.31.16	“If I have withheld the desire of the poor from them, 
JOB.31.16	or
JOB.31.17	or I have eaten my morsel alone,
JOB.31.17	and the orphan has not eaten from it 
JOB.31.18	(for from my childhood he
JOB.31.18	and from my mother’s womb I guided her
JOB.31.19	if I have seen the one who perishes because of no clothing 
JOB.31.19	or
JOB.31.20	if his loins have not blessed me, 
JOB.31.20	or
JOB.31.21	if I have raised my hand against an orphan 
JOB.31.21	because I saw my supporters at the gate, 
JOB.31.22	then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder, 
JOB.31.22	and let my arm be broken from its socket. 
JOB.31.23	Indeed, the disaster from God was a dread for me, 
JOB.31.23	and I was powerless
JOB.31.24	“If I have made gold my trust, 
JOB.31.24	or
JOB.31.25	if I have rejoiced because my wealth was great 
JOB.31.25	or
JOB.31.26	if I looked at the sun when it shone 
JOB.31.26	or
JOB.31.27	and I was secretly enticed,
JOB.31.27	and my hand threw them a kiss,
JOB.31.28	this also is an iniquity to be judged, 
JOB.31.28	for I have deceived God above. 
JOB.31.29	“If I have rejoiced at the ruin of the one who hated me 
JOB.31.29	or
JOB.31.30	no,
JOB.31.30	to ask his life with a curse. 
JOB.31.31	Have the people of my tent not said,
JOB.31.31	‘O that
JOB.31.32	An alien has not lodged in the street; 
JOB.31.32	I have opened my door to the traveler. 
JOB.31.33	Have I concealed
JOB.31.33	to hide my iniquity in my bosom 
JOB.31.34	because I dreaded the great multitude, 
JOB.31.34	and the contempt of clans terrified me, 
JOB.31.34	so that I kept quiet, I did not go out of the doorway? 
JOB.31.35	O that
JOB.31.35	Here is my signature; 
JOB.31.35	let Shaddai answer me! 
JOB.31.35	As for
JOB.31.36	I would surely
JOB.31.36	I would bind it on me like a crown. 
JOB.31.37	I would give him an account of my steps; 
JOB.31.37	I would approach him like a noble. 
JOB.31.38	If my land has cried out against me, 
JOB.31.38	and its furrows have wept together, 
JOB.31.39	if I have eaten its yield without payment, 
JOB.31.39	or
JOB.31.40	let thorns grow in place of wheat 
JOB.31.40	and noxious weeds in place of barley.” 
JOB.31.40	The words of Job are ended. 
JOB.32.1	Then these three men ceased from answering Job because he was righteous in his own eyes. 
JOB.32.2	So Elihu the son of Barakel the Buzite, from the clan of Ram, became angry.
JOB.32.3	and he became angry
JOB.32.4	Thus Elihu had waited for Job to speak
JOB.32.5	When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, he became angry.
JOB.32.6	Then Elihu the son of Barakel the Buzite spoke up
JOB.32.6	“I am young,
JOB.32.6	therefore I feared and became afraid of explaining my knowledge to you.
JOB.32.7	I thought,
JOB.32.7	and let many years teach wisdom.’ 
JOB.32.8	“Truly, it is a spirit in a human being, 
JOB.32.8	and the breath of Shaddai teaches them. 
JOB.32.9	It is not the aged
JOB.32.9	or
JOB.32.10	Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me; 
JOB.32.10	let me also declare my knowledge myself.’ 
JOB.32.11	“Look, I waited for your
JOB.32.11	I listened for your
JOB.32.11	until you searched out what to say.
JOB.32.12	And I directed my attention to you;
JOB.32.12	and, look, there is no one for Job who refuted, 
JOB.32.12	answering his words among you. 
JOB.32.13	So do not say, ‘We have found wisdom; 
JOB.32.13	let God refute him, not a man.’ 
JOB.32.14	But
JOB.32.14	and I will not answer him with your
JOB.32.15	“They are dismayed; they no longer answer; 
JOB.32.15	they have nothing to say.
JOB.32.16	And I have waited because they do not speak, 
JOB.32.16	because they stand there and no longer answer. 
JOB.32.17	I myself will answer my share also; 
JOB.32.17	I myself will declare my knowledge also, 
JOB.32.18	for I am full of words;
JOB.32.18	the spirit within me
JOB.32.19	“Look, my internal organs are like unopened wine, 
JOB.32.19	like new wineskins it
JOB.32.20	Let me speak that I may find relief;
JOB.32.20	let me open my lips, and let me answer. 
JOB.32.21	Please let me not show partiality to anyone,
JOB.32.21	and let me not show flattery to human beings, 
JOB.32.22	for I do not know how to flatter,
JOB.32.22	else my Maker would soon
JOB.33.1	“But now, please hear my speeches,
JOB.33.1	and hear
JOB.33.2	Please look, I open my mouth; 
JOB.33.2	my tongue in my mouth speaks. 
JOB.33.3	My words declare my heart’s uprightness, 
JOB.33.3	and my lips sincerely speak what my lips know.
JOB.33.4	The Spirit of God has made me, 
JOB.33.4	and the breath of Shaddai gives life to me. 
JOB.33.5	“If you are able, answer me. 
JOB.33.5	Present your argument before me;
JOB.33.6	Look, before God I am like you;
JOB.33.6	I myself was also formed from clay. 
JOB.33.7	Look, dread of me should not terrify you, 
JOB.33.7	and my hand will not be heavy upon you. 
JOB.33.8	“Surely you have spoken in my ears, 
JOB.33.8	and I have heard the sound of your words:
JOB.33.9	‘I am clean, without transgression; 
JOB.33.9	I am pure, and there is no guilt in me. 
JOB.33.10	Look, he finds fault against me; 
JOB.33.10	he reckons me as his enemy; 
JOB.33.11	he puts my feet in the block; 
JOB.33.11	he watches all my paths.’ 
JOB.33.12	“Look, in this you are not right—I will answer you: 
JOB.33.12	Indeed, God is greater than a human being. 
JOB.33.13	Why do you contend against him, 
JOB.33.13	that he will not answer all a person’s words? 
JOB.33.14	Indeed, God speaks in one way, 
JOB.33.14	even
JOB.33.15	“In a dream, a vision of the night, 
JOB.33.15	when a deep sleep falls on men slumbering on their bed, 
JOB.33.16	then he opens the ear of men, 
JOB.33.16	and he frightens them with a warning
JOB.33.17	to turn human beings aside from their deeds, 
JOB.33.17	and he keeps man from pride. 
JOB.33.18	He spares his life from the pit 
JOB.33.18	and his life from passing over the river of death. 
JOB.33.19	“And he is reproved with pain on his bed, 
JOB.33.19	even
JOB.33.20	so that
JOB.33.20	and his inner self
JOB.33.21	His flesh is wasted away from sight, 
JOB.33.21	and his bones, which are invisible, are bared. 
JOB.33.22	And he
JOB.33.22	and his life to the killers. 
JOB.33.23	“If there is a messenger beside him, a mediator, one of a thousand,
JOB.33.23	to declare to a human being his uprightness 
JOB.33.24	so that
JOB.33.24	‘Deliver him from descending into the pit; 
JOB.33.24	I have found a ransom.’ 
JOB.33.25	His flesh is renewed with his youth; 
JOB.33.25	he returns to the days of his youthful strength. 
JOB.33.26	He prays to God, then he accepts him, 
JOB.33.26	and he sees his face with a shout of joy, 
JOB.33.26	and he repays to the human being his righteousness. 
JOB.33.27	“He will sing to men, and he will say, 
JOB.33.27	‘I have sinned and have perverted what is right, 
JOB.33.27	and it was not paid back to me. 
JOB.33.28	He redeemed my life from going down into the pit, 
JOB.33.28	so
JOB.33.29	Look, God does all these things 
JOB.33.29	twice, three times
JOB.33.30	to bring his life back from the pit 
JOB.33.30	so that he may enjoy the light of life.
JOB.33.31	“Listen attentively, Job; listen to me; 
JOB.33.31	be silent, and I will speak. 
JOB.33.32	If you have anything to say,
JOB.33.32	speak, for I desire to justify you.
JOB.33.33	If not, you listen to me; 
JOB.33.33	be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.” 
JOB.34.1	Thus
JOB.34.2	“Hear my words, you wise men, 
JOB.34.2	and listen to me, you who know, 
JOB.34.3	for the ear tests words, 
JOB.34.3	and the palate tastes food.
JOB.34.4	Let us choose justice for ourselves; 
JOB.34.4	let us determine among ourselves what is good— 
JOB.34.5	for Job has said, ‘I am righteous, 
JOB.34.5	but God has taken away my justice. 
JOB.34.6	Should I lie concerning my justice? 
JOB.34.6	Though I am without transgression, my wound caused by an arrow is incurable.’ 
JOB.34.7	What man is like Job, 
JOB.34.7	who drinks scorn like water? 
JOB.34.8	And he goes on the road in company with instigators of mischief, 
JOB.34.8	and walks with men of wickedness. 
JOB.34.9	Indeed, he says, ‘A man does not profit 
JOB.34.9	when he takes delight in God.’ 
JOB.34.10	“Therefore, listen to me, people who have sense:
JOB.34.10	far be it from God that he should commit wickedness
JOB.34.10	and that Shaddai should do wrong.
JOB.34.11	Indeed, he will repay according to a human being’s deeds, 
JOB.34.11	and according to a man’s way he will let it happen to him. 
JOB.34.12	What’s more, God truly does not act wickedly, 
JOB.34.12	and Shaddai does not pervert justice. 
JOB.34.13	Who gave him charge over the earth? 
JOB.34.13	Or
JOB.34.14	If he should set his heart to it, 
JOB.34.14	and he should gather his spirit and his breath to himself, 
JOB.34.15	all flesh would perish together, 
JOB.34.15	and humankind would return to dust. 
JOB.34.16	“But
JOB.34.16	listen to what I say.
JOB.34.17	Shall he who hates justice really govern? 
JOB.34.17	Or will you
JOB.34.18	the one who says to a king, 
JOB.34.18	‘You worthless man,’ to noblemen, ‘You wicked man,’ 
JOB.34.19	who shows no partiality to officials
JOB.34.19	and who does not take note of the noble more than of the insignificant,
JOB.34.19	for all of them are the work of his hands? 
JOB.34.20	In a moment they die, 
JOB.34.20	and in the middle of the night the people are shaken, and they pass away, 
JOB.34.20	and they take away the mighty effortlessly.
JOB.34.21	“Indeed, his eyes are upon the ways of man, 
JOB.34.21	and he sees all his steps. 
JOB.34.22	There is no darkness, and there is no deep shadow 
JOB.34.22	where instigators of mischief might hide themselves. 
JOB.34.23	Indeed, he has not yet appointed a time for man 
JOB.34.23	to go to God in the judgment. 
JOB.34.24	He shatters the mighty without investigation, 
JOB.34.24	and he sets others in their place. 
JOB.34.25	Therefore he knows their works, 
JOB.34.25	and he overturns them in the night 
JOB.34.25	so that
JOB.34.26	He strikes them where the wicked stood,
JOB.34.26	where there are onlookers,
JOB.34.27	because they have turned aside from him 
JOB.34.27	and have not understood any of his ways, 
JOB.34.28	so that they cause the cry of distress from the helpless to come to him, 
JOB.34.28	and he hears the cry of distress from the needy, 
JOB.34.29	but he remains quiet, and who can condemn? 
JOB.34.29	And he hides his face, and who can behold him? 
JOB.34.29	Yet
JOB.34.30	so that godless human beings should not reign, 
JOB.34.30	nor those who ensnare the people. 
JOB.34.31	“Indeed, does anyone say to God, ‘I have endured chastisement; 
JOB.34.31	I will not act corruptly again; 
JOB.34.32	teach me yourself what I cannot see;
JOB.34.32	if I have done wrong, I will not repeat it’? 
JOB.34.33	According to your judgment,
JOB.34.33	Indeed, you must choose, and not I, so
JOB.34.34	Those who have sense
JOB.34.34	and the wise man hearing me says: 
JOB.34.35	‘Job speaks without knowledge, 
JOB.34.35	and his words are without insight. 
JOB.34.36	Would that Job were tested up to the end 
JOB.34.36	because his answers are like those from men of mischief, 
JOB.34.37	for he adds transgression to his sin; 
JOB.34.37	he claps hands among us, 
JOB.34.37	and he multiplies his words against God.’ ” 
JOB.35.1	Moreover,
JOB.35.2	“Do you think this is justice when you say, 
JOB.35.2	‘I am right
JOB.35.3	If you ask what it profits you: 
JOB.35.3	‘How do I benefit by refraining from my sin?’
JOB.35.4	I myself
JOB.35.4	and to your friends with you. 
JOB.35.5	“Look at the heavens, and see; 
JOB.35.5	and observe the clouds that are higher than you. 
JOB.35.6	If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him? 
JOB.35.6	And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him? 
JOB.35.7	If you are righteous, what do you give to him, 
JOB.35.7	or what does he receive from your hand? 
JOB.35.8	Your wickedness affects a person like yourself, 
JOB.35.8	and your righteousness affects humans. 
JOB.35.9	“Because of the multitude of oppressions, they cry out; 
JOB.35.9	they cry for help because of the arm of the mighty. 
JOB.35.10	But
JOB.35.10	who gives songs in the night, 
JOB.35.11	who teaches us more than the animals of the earth 
JOB.35.11	and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?’ 
JOB.35.12	There they cry out, but
JOB.35.12	because of the pride of evildoers.
JOB.35.13	“Surely God does not hear an empty plea, 
JOB.35.13	and Shaddai does not regard it. 
JOB.35.14	How much less
JOB.35.14	that the case is before him,
JOB.35.15	But
JOB.35.15	and he does not acknowledge the transgression at all, 
JOB.35.16	therefore
JOB.35.16	without knowledge he multiplies words.” 
JOB.36.1	Then
JOB.36.2	“Bear with me a little longer, and I will explain,
JOB.36.2	for I still have something to say on God’s behalf.
JOB.36.3	I will bring my knowledge from far away, 
JOB.36.3	and I will ascribe righteousness to my maker, 
JOB.36.4	for truly my words
JOB.36.4	one who has perfect knowledge is with you.
JOB.36.5	Look, God is mighty but
JOB.36.5	he is mighty and good in understanding.
JOB.36.6	He does not keep the wicked alive 
JOB.36.6	but
JOB.36.7	He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, 
JOB.36.7	but
JOB.36.8	“And if they are tied up with fetters, 
JOB.36.8	if they are caught in the cords of misery, 
JOB.36.9	then
JOB.36.9	and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly. 
JOB.36.10	So
JOB.36.10	and he commands that they return from mischief. 
JOB.36.11	If they listen and serve him, 
JOB.36.11	they complete their days in prosperity and their years in pleasantness. 
JOB.36.12	But
JOB.36.12	and they pass away without knowledge. 
JOB.36.13	And the godless of heart cherish anger; 
JOB.36.13	they do not cry for help when he binds them. 
JOB.36.14	They die in their youth,
JOB.36.14	and their life ends among the male shrine prostitutes. 
JOB.36.15	He delivers the afflicted by his misery, 
JOB.36.15	and he opens their ears by the adversity. 
JOB.36.16	And what’s more, he allured you out of distress
JOB.36.16	into a broad place, where in place of it was no constraint; 
JOB.36.16	and what was set on your table is full of fatness. 
JOB.36.17	But
JOB.36.17	judgment and justice take hold of you. 
JOB.36.18	Yes,
JOB.36.18	and do not let the ransom’s greatness turn you aside. 
JOB.36.19	Will your cry for help sustain you without distress, 
JOB.36.19	or
JOB.36.20	You must not long for the night, 
JOB.36.20	to cut off people in their place.
JOB.36.21	Take care, you must not turn to mischief, 
JOB.36.21	for because of this you have been tried by misery. 
JOB.36.22	“Look, God is exalted in his power; 
JOB.36.22	who is a teacher like him? 
JOB.36.23	Who has prescribed his way for him? 
JOB.36.23	Or
JOB.36.24	Remember that you should extol his work, 
JOB.36.24	of which people have sung. 
JOB.36.25	All human beings have looked on it; 
JOB.36.25	everyone watches from afar. 
JOB.36.26	“Look, God is exalted, and we do not know him; 
JOB.36.26	the number of his years is unsearchable. 
JOB.36.27	Indeed, he draws up the drops of water; 
JOB.36.27	he distills the rain into its mist, 
JOB.36.28	which the clouds pour down; 
JOB.36.28	they shower abundantly on human beings. 
JOB.36.29	“Moreover, can anyone understand
JOB.36.29	the thundering of his dwelling place? 
JOB.36.30	Look, he scatters his lightning around him, 
JOB.36.30	and he covers the roots of the sea. 
JOB.36.31	Indeed, he judges people by them; 
JOB.36.31	he gives food in abundance.
JOB.36.32	He covers his hands with lightning, 
JOB.36.32	and he commands it the place at which to strike. 
JOB.36.33	His thundering tells about him; 
JOB.36.33	the livestock also tell concerning what rises.
JOB.37.1	“About this also my heart trembles, 
JOB.37.1	and it leaps from its place. 
JOB.37.2	Listen carefully to his voice’s thunder 
JOB.37.2	and the rumbling that goes out from his mouth. 
JOB.37.3	He lets it loose under all the heavens, 
JOB.37.3	and his lightning to the earth’s corners. 
JOB.37.4	After it, his voice roars; 
JOB.37.4	it thunders with his majestic voice,
JOB.37.4	and he does not restrain it when his voice is heard. 
JOB.37.5	“God thunders with his voice in marvelous ways; 
JOB.37.5	he does great things, and we cannot comprehend. 
JOB.37.6	For to the snow he says, ‘Fall on the earth’; 
JOB.37.6	and the shower of rain, his heavy shower of rain
JOB.37.7	he stops all human beings from working
JOB.37.7	so that everyone whom he has made may know it.
JOB.37.8	Then
JOB.37.8	and it remains in its den. 
JOB.37.9	“The storm wind comes from its chamber 
JOB.37.9	and cold from the north wind. 
JOB.37.10	By God’s breath, ice is given, 
JOB.37.10	and the broad waters are frozen. 
JOB.37.11	Also, he loads down thick clouds with moisture; 
JOB.37.11	his lightning scatters the clouds. 
JOB.37.12	And they
JOB.37.12	to accomplish all that he has commanded them 
JOB.37.12	on the face of the habitable world.
JOB.37.13	Whether as correction
JOB.37.13	or as loyal love, he lets it happen. 
JOB.37.14	“Hear this, Job; 
JOB.37.14	stand still and consider carefully God’s wondrous works. 
JOB.37.15	Do you know how God commands them
JOB.37.15	and how he causes his cloud’s lightning to shine? 
JOB.37.16	Do you know about the hovering of the clouds, 
JOB.37.16	the marvelous works of the one with perfect knowledge?
JOB.37.17	You whose garments are hot, 
JOB.37.17	when the earth is being still because of the south wind, 
JOB.37.18	with him can you spread out the skies, 
JOB.37.18	hard as a molten mirror? 
JOB.37.19	“Teach us what we should say to him; 
JOB.37.19	we cannot draw up our case because of the presence of darkness. 
JOB.37.20	Should he be told that I want to speak? 
JOB.37.20	Or did a man say that he would be communicated with? 
JOB.37.21	So then, they do not look at the light when it is bright in the skies, 
JOB.37.21	when
JOB.37.22	From the north comes gold— 
JOB.37.22	awesome majesty is around God. 
JOB.37.23	As for Shaddai, we cannot attain him; 
JOB.37.23	he is exalted in power, 
JOB.37.23	and he does not oppress justice and abundant righteousness. 
JOB.37.24	Therefore people revered him; 
JOB.37.24	he does not regard any
JOB.38.1	Then
JOB.38.2	“Who is this darkening counsel 
JOB.38.2	by words without knowledge? 
JOB.38.3	Prepare yourself for a difficult task like a man,
JOB.38.3	and I will question you, and you shall declare to me. 
JOB.38.4	“Where were you at my laying the foundation of the earth? 
JOB.38.4	Tell me, if you possess understanding. 
JOB.38.5	Who determined its measurement? Yes, you do know. 
JOB.38.5	Or who stretched the measuring line upon it? 
JOB.38.6	On what were its bases sunk? 
JOB.38.6	Or who laid its cornerstone, 
JOB.38.7	when the morning stars were singing together 
JOB.38.7	and all the sons of God
JOB.38.8	“Or who shut the sea in with doors 
JOB.38.8	at its bursting, when it went out of the womb, 
JOB.38.9	at my making the clouds its garment 
JOB.38.9	and thick darkness its swaddling band, 
JOB.38.10	and I prescribed my rule for it, 
JOB.38.10	and I set bars and doors, 
JOB.38.11	and I said, ‘You shall come up to here, but
JOB.38.11	and here it will set a boundary for your proud surging waves’?
JOB.38.12	“Have you ever in your life
JOB.38.12	Have you made the dawn know its place, 
JOB.38.13	to take hold of the earth’s skirts 
JOB.38.13	so that
JOB.38.14	It is changed like clay under a seal, 
JOB.38.14	and they appear like a garment. 
JOB.38.15	And their light is withheld from the wicked, 
JOB.38.15	and their uplifted arm is broken. 
JOB.38.16	“Have you entered into the sea’s sources? 
JOB.38.16	Or have you walked around in the recesses of the deep? 
JOB.38.17	Have the gates of death been revealed to you? 
JOB.38.17	Or have you seen the gates of deep shadow? 
JOB.38.18	Have you considered closely the earth’s vast expanse? 
JOB.38.18	Declare it, if you know all of it. 
JOB.38.19	“Where then
JOB.38.19	And where then
JOB.38.20	that you may take it to its territory, 
JOB.38.20	and that you might discern the paths to its home? 
JOB.38.21	You know, for you were born then, 
JOB.38.21	and the number of your days is great. 
JOB.38.22	Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow, 
JOB.38.22	or
JOB.38.23	which I have reserved for the time of trouble, 
JOB.38.23	for the day of battle and war? 
JOB.38.24	Where then
JOB.38.24	where he scatters the east wind upon the earth? 
JOB.38.25	“Who has cut open a channel for the torrents 
JOB.38.25	and a way for the thunder bolts,
JOB.38.26	to bring rain on a land where no one lives,
JOB.38.26	a desert where no humans live,
JOB.38.27	to satisfy desert and wasteland, 
JOB.38.27	and to cause the ground to put forth the rising of grass? 
JOB.38.28	Is there a father for the rain, 
JOB.38.28	or who fathered the drops of dew? 
JOB.38.29	From whose womb did the ice come forth, 
JOB.38.29	and who fathered the frost of heaven? 
JOB.38.30	Like stone the waters become hard, 
JOB.38.30	and the faces of the deep freeze. 
JOB.38.31	“Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades, 
JOB.38.31	or can you loosen the cords of Orion? 
JOB.38.32	Can you lead forth the southern constellations at their appointed time, 
JOB.38.32	or
JOB.38.33	Do you know heaven’s statutes, 
JOB.38.33	or can you establish their rule on the earth? 
JOB.38.34	Can you lift up your voice to the clouds 
JOB.38.34	so that
JOB.38.35	Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go? 
JOB.38.35	And will they say to you, ‘Here we are’? 
JOB.38.36	Who has put wisdom in the ibis,
JOB.38.36	or who has given understanding to the rooster?
JOB.38.37	Who can number the clouds with wisdom? 
JOB.38.37	Or
JOB.38.38	at the flowing of the dust into a cast 
JOB.38.38	and the clods cling together? 
JOB.38.39	“Can you hunt prey for the lion? 
JOB.38.39	And can you satisfy the hunger of strong lions 
JOB.38.40	when they are crouched in the dens, 
JOB.38.40	when they lie in the thicket in an ambush? 
JOB.38.41	Who prepares for the crow its prey, 
JOB.38.41	when its young ones cry to God for help, 
JOB.38.41	and they wander around for lack of food?
JOB.39.1	 “Do you know the time when the goats of the rocks give birth? 
JOB.39.1	Do you observe the doe deer’s giving birth? 
JOB.39.2	Can you number the months they fulfill, 
JOB.39.2	and do you know the time of its giving birth? 
JOB.39.3	When they crouch, they bring forth their young ones; 
JOB.39.3	they get rid of their labor pains.
JOB.39.4	Their young ones grow strong; they grow up in the open; 
JOB.39.4	they go forth and do not return to them. 
JOB.39.5	“Who has sent forth the wild ass free? 
JOB.39.5	And who has released the wild donkey’s bonds, 
JOB.39.6	to which I have given the wilderness as its house 
JOB.39.6	and the salt flat as its dwelling place? 
JOB.39.7	It scorns the city’s turmoil; 
JOB.39.7	it does not hear the driver’s shouts. 
JOB.39.8	It explores the mountains as its pasture 
JOB.39.8	and searches after every kind of green plant. 
JOB.39.9	“Is the wild ox willing to serve you, 
JOB.39.9	or will he spend the night at your feeding trough? 
JOB.39.10	Can you tie the wild ox with its rope to a furrow, 
JOB.39.10	or will it harrow the valleys after you? 
JOB.39.11	Can you trust it because its strength is great, 
JOB.39.11	or will you hand your labor over to it? 
JOB.39.12	Can you rely on it that it will return your grain 
JOB.39.12	and that it will gather it to your threshing floor? 
JOB.39.13	“The wings
JOB.39.13	are they
JOB.39.14	Indeed, it leaves its eggs to the earth, 
JOB.39.14	and it lets them be warmed on the ground, 
JOB.39.15	and it forgets that a foot might crush an egg,
JOB.39.15	and a wild animal
JOB.39.16	It deals cruelly with its young ones, as if they were not its own, 
JOB.39.16	as if without fear that its labor were in vain, 
JOB.39.17	because God made it forget wisdom, 
JOB.39.17	and he did not give it a share in understanding. 
JOB.39.18	When it spreads its wings aloft,
JOB.39.18	it laughs at the horse and its rider. 
JOB.39.19	“Do you give power to the horse? 
JOB.39.19	Do you clothe its neck with a mane? 
JOB.39.20	Do you make it leap like the locust? 
JOB.39.20	The majesty of its snorting is terrifying. 
JOB.39.21	They paw in the valley, and it exults with strength; 
JOB.39.21	it goes out to meet the battle. 
JOB.39.22	It laughs at danger and is not dismayed, 
JOB.39.22	and it does not turn back from before
JOB.39.23	Upon it the quiver rattles 
JOB.39.23	along with the flash of the spear and the short sword. 
JOB.39.24	With roar and rage it races over the ground,
JOB.39.24	and it cannot stand still at the sound of the horn. 
JOB.39.25	Whenever
JOB.39.25	And it smells the battle from a distance— 
JOB.39.25	the thunder of the commanders and the war cry. 
JOB.39.26	“Does the hawk soar by your wisdom? 
JOB.39.26	Does it spread its wings to the south? 
JOB.39.27	Or does the eagle fly high at your command 
JOB.39.27	and construct its nest high? 
JOB.39.28	It lives on the rock and spends the night 
JOB.39.28	on the rock point and the mountain stronghold.
JOB.39.29	From there it spies out the prey; 
JOB.39.29	its eyes look from far away. 
JOB.39.30	And its young ones lick blood greedily, 
JOB.39.30	and where the dead carcasses are, there they are.” 
JOB.40.1	 Then
JOB.40.2	“Shall a faultfinder contend with Shaddai? 
JOB.40.2	Anyone who argues with God must answer it.” 
JOB.40.3	So Job answered Yahweh and said, 
JOB.40.4	“Look, I am insignificant. 
JOB.40.4	What shall I answer you? 
JOB.40.4	I lay my hand on my mouth. 
JOB.40.5	Once I have spoken, and I will not answer; 
JOB.40.5	even
JOB.40.6	Then
JOB.40.7	“Prepare yourself for a difficult task like a man,
JOB.40.7	and I will question you, and you shall declare to me. 
JOB.40.8	“Indeed, would you annul my justice? 
JOB.40.8	Would you condemn me, so that you might be righteous? 
JOB.40.9	Or do you have an arm like God, 
JOB.40.9	and can you thunder with a voice like his? 
JOB.40.10	Adorn
JOB.40.10	and clothe yourself with splendor. 
JOB.40.11	Pour out the overflowing of your anger, 
JOB.40.11	and look at all the proud, and humble them. 
JOB.40.12	Look at all the proud, humble them, 
JOB.40.12	and tread down the wicked where they stand.
JOB.40.13	Hide them in the dust together; 
JOB.40.13	bind their faces in the grave. 
JOB.40.14	And I will also praise you, 
JOB.40.14	that your own right hand can save you. 
JOB.40.15	“Look, Behemoth,
JOB.40.15	it eats grass like the ox. 
JOB.40.16	Look, its strength is in its loins 
JOB.40.16	and its power in the muscles of its stomach. 
JOB.40.17	It keeps its tail straight like a cedar; 
JOB.40.17	the sinews of its thighs are tightly wound. 
JOB.40.18	Its bones are tubes of copper, 
JOB.40.18	its limbs like rods of iron. 
JOB.40.19	“It is the first of God’s actions; 
JOB.40.19	the one who made him furnishes it with his sword.
JOB.40.20	Yes, the mountains yield produce for it, 
JOB.40.20	and all wild animals
JOB.40.21	Under the lotus tree it lies, 
JOB.40.21	in the hiding place of the reeds and in the marsh. 
JOB.40.22	The lotus trees cover it with their shade; 
JOB.40.22	the wadi’s
JOB.40.23	Look, if the river is turbulent, it is not frightened; 
JOB.40.23	it is confident even though the Jordan rushes against its mouth. 
JOB.40.24	Can anyone take it by its eyes? 
JOB.40.24	Can he pierce its nose with a snare? 
JOB.41.1	Or
JOB.41.2	Can you put a rope in its nose? 
JOB.41.2	Or
JOB.41.3	Will it make numerous pleas for mercy to you? 
JOB.41.3	Or will it speak gentle words to you? 
JOB.41.4	Will it make a covenant with you? 
JOB.41.4	Will you take it as a slave forever? 
JOB.41.5	Will you play with it as with birds 
JOB.41.5	and put it on a leash for your girls? 
JOB.41.6	Will guildsmen bargain over it? 
JOB.41.6	Will they divide it between tradesmen? 
JOB.41.7	Can you fill its kin with harpoons 
JOB.41.7	or
JOB.41.8	Lay your hands on it; 
JOB.41.8	think about the battle—you will not do it again! 
JOB.41.9	“Look, the hope of capturing it
JOB.41.9	Will one be hurled down even at its sight? 
JOB.41.10	Is it not fierce when somebody stirs it? 
JOB.41.10	Who then is he who would stand before it?
JOB.41.11	Who has come to confront me, that
JOB.41.11	Under all the heavens, it belongs to me.
JOB.41.12	“I will not keep quiet concerning its limbs 
JOB.41.12	or
JOB.41.13	Who can strip off its outer covering?
JOB.41.13	Who can penetrate its double harness? 
JOB.41.14	Who can open the doors of its face? 
JOB.41.14	Its teeth all around are fearsome. 
JOB.41.15	Its back
JOB.41.15	it is shut up closely as with a seal. 
JOB.41.16	They are close to one another—
JOB.41.16	even
JOB.41.17	They are joined one to another;
JOB.41.17	they cling together and cannot be separated. 
JOB.41.18	“Its snorting flashes forth light, 
JOB.41.18	and its eyes are red like dawn.
JOB.41.19	Torches go from its mouth; 
JOB.41.19	sparks of fire shoot out. 
JOB.41.20	Smoke comes from its nostrils 
JOB.41.20	as from a kettle boiling and burning bulrushes. 
JOB.41.21	Its breath kindles charcoal, 
JOB.41.21	and a flame comes from its mouth. 
JOB.41.22	“Strength abides in its neck, 
JOB.41.22	and dismay
JOB.41.23	Its flesh’s folds of skin cling together; 
JOB.41.23	it is cast on it—it will not be moved. 
JOB.41.24	Its heart is cast as stone; 
JOB.41.24	yes,
JOB.41.25	When it raises itself,
JOB.41.25	they retreat because of its thrashing. 
JOB.41.26	Reaching it with the sword does not avail, 
JOB.41.26	nor with the spear, the dart, or
JOB.41.27	It regards iron as straw, 
JOB.41.27	bronze as rotten wood. 
JOB.41.28	An arrow
JOB.41.28	sling stones are turned to stubble for it. 
JOB.41.29	Clubs are regarded as stubble, 
JOB.41.29	and it laughs at the short sword’s rattle. 
JOB.41.30	“Its underparts are shards of a potsherd; 
JOB.41.30	it moves over mud like a threshing sledge. 
JOB.41.31	It makes the deep boil like a cooking pot; 
JOB.41.31	it makes the sea like a pot of ointment. 
JOB.41.32	Behind it, it leaves a glistening wake;
JOB.41.32	one would think that the deep has gray hair. 
JOB.41.33	“On the ground it has no equal
JOB.41.33	a
JOB.41.34	It observes all the lofty; 
JOB.41.34	it is king over all that are proud.”
JOB.42.1	Then
JOB.42.2	“I know that you can do all things, 
JOB.42.2	and any scheme from you will not be thwarted. 
JOB.42.3	‘Who is this darkening counsel without knowledge?’ 
JOB.42.3	Therefore I uttered, but
JOB.42.3	things too wonderful for me,
JOB.42.4	‘Hear and I will speak; 
JOB.42.4	I will question you, then
JOB.42.5	By the ear’s hearing I heard of you, 
JOB.42.5	but
JOB.42.6	Therefore I despise myself 
JOB.42.6	and repent in dust and ashes.” 
JOB.42.7	And then
JOB.42.8	So then,
JOB.42.9	So
JOB.42.10	Then
JOB.42.11	So
JOB.42.12	So
JOB.42.13	And he had
JOB.42.14	And he called the name of the first Jemimah and the name of the second Keziah and the name of the third Qeren-Happuk. 
JOB.42.15	And beautiful women were not found in all the land like Job’s daughters, and their father gave to them an inheritance in the midst of their brothers. 
JOB.42.16	And Job lived after this one hundred and forty years, and he saw his sons and his grandsons
JOB.42.17	Then
PSA.1.1	Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked; 
PSA.1.1	nor does he stand in the way of sinners; 
PSA.1.1	nor does he sit in the assembly of mockers. 
PSA.1.2	Instead, in the law of Yahweh is his delight, 
PSA.1.2	and on his law he meditates day and night. 
PSA.1.3	And so, he is like a tree planted by streams of water 
PSA.1.3	that gives its fruit in its season; 
PSA.1.3	its leaf also does not wither. 
PSA.1.3	Therefore all that he does prospers. 
PSA.1.4	Not so the wicked. 
PSA.1.4	Instead, they are like the chaff that the wind scatters. 
PSA.1.5	Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, 
PSA.1.5	nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous; 
PSA.1.6	for Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,
PSA.1.6	but the way of the wicked will perish. 
PSA.2.1	Why are nations in tumult, 
PSA.2.1	and countries plotting
PSA.2.2	The kings of the earth establish themselves, 
PSA.2.2	and the rulers conspire
PSA.2.2	against Yahweh and his anointed: 
PSA.2.3	“Let us tear off their bonds, 
PSA.2.3	and cast their cords from us!” 
PSA.2.4	He who sits enthroned in the heavens laughs. 
PSA.2.4	The Lord derides them. 
PSA.2.5	Then he speaks to them in his wrath, 
PSA.2.5	and in his fury he terrifies them: 
PSA.2.6	“But as for me, I have set my king 
PSA.2.6	on Zion, my holy mountain.” 
PSA.2.7	I will tell the decree; 
PSA.2.7	Yahweh said to me: 
PSA.2.7	“You are my son; 
PSA.2.7	today I have begotten you. 
PSA.2.8	Ask from me and I will make the nations your heritage, 
PSA.2.8	and your possession the ends of the earth. 
PSA.2.9	You will break them with an iron rod. 
PSA.2.9	Like a potter’s vessel you will shatter them.” 
PSA.2.10	So then, O kings, be wise. 
PSA.2.10	Be warned, O rulers of the earth. 
PSA.2.11	Serve Yahweh with fear, 
PSA.2.11	and rejoice with trembling. 
PSA.2.12	Kiss the Son 
PSA.2.12	lest he be angry and you perish on the way, 
PSA.2.12	for his anger burns quickly. 
PSA.2.12	Blessed are all who take refuge in him. 
PSA.3.1	Yahweh, how many are my enemies; 
PSA.3.1	many are rising against me. 
PSA.3.2	Many are saying about my soul, 
PSA.3.2	“There is no deliverance for him from
PSA.3.3	But
PSA.3.3	my glory and the one who lifts up my head. 
PSA.3.4	With my voice I call to Yahweh 
PSA.3.4	and he answers me from his holy hill.
PSA.3.5	I lay down and slept; 
PSA.3.5	I woke up because Yahweh sustains me. 
PSA.3.6	I am not afraid of the ten thousands of people 
PSA.3.6	who all around have set themselves against me. 
PSA.3.7	Rise up, O Yahweh; deliver me, O my God; 
PSA.3.7	for you strike all my enemies on the cheek. 
PSA.3.7	The teeth of the wicked you break. 
PSA.3.8	To Yahweh belongs deliverance; 
PSA.3.8	may your blessing be over your people. 
PSA.4.1	When I call, answer me, O God of my righteousness.
PSA.4.1	In trouble deliver me.
PSA.4.1	Be gracious to me and hear my prayer. 
PSA.4.2	O sons of man, how long will my honor
PSA.4.2	How long will you love vanity? 
PSA.4.2	How long will you seek lies?
PSA.4.3	But know that Yahweh has set apart
PSA.4.3	Yahweh hears when I call to him. 
PSA.4.4	Be disturbed but do not sin. 
PSA.4.4	Commune in your heart
PSA.4.5	Offer correct sacrifices,
PSA.4.5	and trust in
PSA.4.6	Many are saying, “Who will show us something good?” 
PSA.4.6	Lift up over
PSA.4.7	You have put gladness in my heart 
PSA.4.7	more than when
PSA.4.8	In peace I will lie down and sleep at once,
PSA.4.8	for you alone, O Yahweh, make me dwell safely. 
PSA.5.1	Hear my words, O Yahweh. 
PSA.5.1	Give heed to my sighing.
PSA.5.2	Listen to the sound of my pleading,
PSA.5.2	for to you I pray. 
PSA.5.3	O Yahweh, in the morning you will hear my voice. 
PSA.5.3	In the morning I will set forth
PSA.5.4	For you are not a God who desires
PSA.5.4	Evil cannot dwell with you. 
PSA.5.5	The boastful do not stand before
PSA.5.5	You hate all evildoers. 
PSA.5.6	You destroy speakers of lies.
PSA.5.6	A man of bloodshed
PSA.5.7	But as for me,
PSA.5.7	I will enter your house.
PSA.5.7	I will bow down
PSA.5.8	O Yahweh, lead me in your righteousness because of my enemies; 
PSA.5.8	make straight before me your way. 
PSA.5.9	For there is not anything reliable in his mouth; 
PSA.5.9	their inner part is destruction.
PSA.5.9	Their throat is an open grave; 
PSA.5.9	with their tongue they speak deceit.
PSA.5.10	Treat them as guilty, O God; 
PSA.5.10	let them fall because of their plans. 
PSA.5.10	Because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out, 
PSA.5.10	for they have rebelled against you. 
PSA.5.11	But let all who take shelter in you rejoice. 
PSA.5.11	Let them ever
PSA.5.11	because
PSA.5.11	And let those
PSA.5.12	For you bless the righteous. 
PSA.5.12	O Yahweh, like a
PSA.6.1	O Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger, 
PSA.6.1	and do not discipline me in your wrath. 
PSA.6.2	Be gracious to me, O Yahweh, because I am feeble. 
PSA.6.2	Heal me, O Yahweh, for my bones are terrified. 
PSA.6.3	My soul is also very terrified. 
PSA.6.3	But you, O Yahweh, how long? 
PSA.6.4	Turn, O Yahweh; deliver my life.
PSA.6.4	Save me for the sake of your steadfast love.
PSA.6.5	For there is no remembrance of you in death. 
PSA.6.5	In Sheol, who will give thanks to you? 
PSA.6.6	I am weary with my groaning; 
PSA.6.6	I flood
PSA.6.6	With my tears I drench
PSA.6.7	My eye wastes away because of vexation; 
PSA.6.7	it grows old because of all my oppressors. 
PSA.6.8	Depart from me, all workers of evil, 
PSA.6.8	for Yahweh has heard the sound of my weeping. 
PSA.6.9	Yahweh has heard my plea; 
PSA.6.9	Yahweh has accepted my prayer. 
PSA.6.10	All my enemies shall be ashamed and shall be very terrified. 
PSA.6.10	They shall turn back; they shall suddenly be ashamed. 
PSA.7.1	O Yahweh, my God, in you I have taken refuge. 
PSA.7.1	Save me from all who pursue me, and deliver me. 
PSA.7.2	Or else he will tear me apart like a lion, 
PSA.7.2	ripping to pieces, with none to deliver. 
PSA.7.3	O Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, 
PSA.7.3	if there is wrong in my hands, 
PSA.7.4	if I have repaid my ally
PSA.7.4	or if I have plundered my enemy without cause, 
PSA.7.5	let the enemy of my soul pursue, 
PSA.7.5	and overtake and trample my life into the ground, 
PSA.7.5	and lay my honor in the dust. 
PSA.7.6	Rise up, O Yahweh, in your anger, 
PSA.7.6	and lift yourself up against the wrath
PSA.7.6	and awake for me, 
PSA.7.6	since you have commanded judgment. 
PSA.7.7	And let the assembly of peoples surround you, 
PSA.7.7	and over it return on high. 
PSA.7.8	Yahweh judges the nations. 
PSA.7.8	O Yahweh, vindicate me 
PSA.7.8	according to my innocence
PSA.7.9	Let the evil of the wicked come to an end, 
PSA.7.9	but establish the righteous, 
PSA.7.9	and test the hearts and innermost being, O righteous God. 
PSA.7.10	My shield is with God 
PSA.7.10	who saves the upright of heart. 
PSA.7.11	God is a righteous judge, 
PSA.7.11	and a God who has indignation every day. 
PSA.7.12	If he
PSA.7.12	He has bent his bow and he has strung
PSA.7.13	And he has prepared for him weapons of death. 
PSA.7.13	He has made his arrows fiery shafts. 
PSA.7.14	See, he
PSA.7.14	He is pregnant with trouble, 
PSA.7.14	and he gives birth to deception. 
PSA.7.15	He makes a pit and digs it out, 
PSA.7.15	then falls in the trap he has made. 
PSA.7.16	His trouble comes back on his head, 
PSA.7.16	and his violence comes down on his skull. 
PSA.7.17	I will thank Yahweh according to his righteousness, 
PSA.7.17	and I will sing praise to the name of Yahweh, the Most High. 
PSA.8.1	Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth, 
PSA.8.1	who put your splendor above the heavens. 
PSA.8.2	From the mouth of children and infants you have founded
PSA.8.2	on account of your enemies, 
PSA.8.2	to silence the enemy and the avenger. 
PSA.8.3	When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, 
PSA.8.3	the moon and the stars which you set in place— 
PSA.8.4	what is a human being that you think of him? 
PSA.8.4	and a child of humankind that you care for him? 
PSA.8.5	And you made him a little lower than heavenly beings,
PSA.8.5	and with glory and with majesty you crowned him. 
PSA.8.6	You make him over the works of your hands; 
PSA.8.6	all things you have placed under his feet: 
PSA.8.7	sheep and cattle, all of them, 
PSA.8.7	and also the wild animals of the field, 
PSA.8.8	the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea, 
PSA.8.8	everything that passes along the paths of seas. 
PSA.8.9	Yahweh, our Lord, 
PSA.8.9	how majestic is your name in all of the earth! 
PSA.9.1	I will thank Yahweh with all my heart. 
PSA.9.1	I will tell of all your wonderful deeds. 
PSA.9.2	I will be glad and rejoice in you. 
PSA.9.2	I will sing the praise of your name, O Most High. 
PSA.9.3	When my enemies turn back, 
PSA.9.3	they will stumble and perish because of your presence. 
PSA.9.4	For you have maintained my just cause; 
PSA.9.4	you have sat on the throne judging correctly. 
PSA.9.5	You have rebuked the nations; 
PSA.9.5	you have destroyed the wicked. 
PSA.9.5	Their name you have blotted out 
PSA.9.5	forever and ever. 
PSA.9.6	The enemies are destroyed in ruins forever, 
PSA.9.6	and you have uprooted their cities; 
PSA.9.6	their very memory has perished. 
PSA.9.7	But Yahweh sits enthroned forever. 
PSA.9.7	He has established his throne for judgment. 
PSA.9.8	And he will judge the world with righteousness. 
PSA.9.8	He will judge the peoples with equity. 
PSA.9.9	And Yahweh will be a stronghold for the oppressed, 
PSA.9.9	a stronghold in times of distress. 
PSA.9.10	And those who know your name will trust in you, 
PSA.9.10	for you do not forsake those who seek you, O Yahweh. 
PSA.9.11	Sing praises to Yahweh who sits enthroned
PSA.9.11	Tell his deeds among the peoples, 
PSA.9.12	for he who avenges bloodshed
PSA.9.12	He does not forget the distressed cry of the afflicted. 
PSA.9.13	Be gracious to me, O Yahweh. 
PSA.9.13	See my suffering from those who hate me, 
PSA.9.13	you who lift me up from the gates of death, 
PSA.9.14	so that I may tell of all your praises. 
PSA.9.14	In the gates of the daughter of Zion 
PSA.9.14	let me rejoice in your salvation. 
PSA.9.15	The nations have fallen in the pit that they made; 
PSA.9.15	their foot is caught in the net that they hid. 
PSA.9.16	Yahweh has made himself known; 
PSA.9.16	he has executed judgment. 
PSA.9.16	The wicked is snared by the work of his hands. 
PSA.9.17	The wicked shall turn back to Sheol, 
PSA.9.17	all the nations forgetting God, 
PSA.9.18	for the needy shall not always be forgotten; 
PSA.9.18	the hope of the poor shall never perish. 
PSA.9.19	Rise up, O Yahweh, let not humans
PSA.9.19	let the nations be judged before you. 
PSA.9.20	O Yahweh, put them in fear. 
PSA.9.20	Let the nations know they are merely human. 
PSA.10.1	Why, O Yahweh, do you stand far off? 
PSA.10.1	Why do you hide
PSA.10.2	In arrogance the wicked persecutes
PSA.10.2	Let them be caught in the schemes that they devised, 
PSA.10.3	for the wicked boasts about the desire of his heart,
PSA.10.3	and the one greedy for gain curses and treats Yahweh with contempt. 
PSA.10.4	With bald-faced pride
PSA.10.4	There is no God in any of his thoughts. 
PSA.10.5	His ways
PSA.10.5	Your judgments are aloof from him. 
PSA.10.5	As for all his enemies, he scoffs at them. 
PSA.10.6	He says in his heart, “I shall not be moved 
PSA.10.6	throughout all generations,
PSA.10.7	His mouth is filled with cursing, 
PSA.10.7	with deceits and oppression; 
PSA.10.7	under his tongue are trouble and evil. 
PSA.10.8	He sits in ambush in villages; 
PSA.10.8	in the hiding places he kills the innocent. 
PSA.10.8	His eyes lurk
PSA.10.9	He lies in ambush secretly,
PSA.10.9	He lies in ambush to seize the poor; 
PSA.10.9	he seizes the poor by catching him in his net. 
PSA.10.10	He is crushed;
PSA.10.10	so
PSA.10.11	He says in his heart, “God has forgotten. 
PSA.10.11	He has hidden his face. 
PSA.10.11	He never sees.” 
PSA.10.12	Rise up, O Yahweh; 
PSA.10.12	O God, lift up your hand. 
PSA.10.12	Do not forget the afflicted. 
PSA.10.13	Why does the wicked treat God with contempt? 
PSA.10.13	He says in his heart, “You will not call me to account.” 
PSA.10.14	But you have seen; indeed you have noted trouble and grief 
PSA.10.14	to take it into your hand. 
PSA.10.14	The helpless abandons himself upon you; 
PSA.10.14	you have been the helper for the orphan. 
PSA.10.15	Break the arm of the wicked, 
PSA.10.15	and as for the evil man— 
PSA.10.15	seek out his wickedness until you find none. 
PSA.10.16	Yahweh is king forever and ever; 
PSA.10.16	the nations have perished from his land. 
PSA.10.17	The longing of the afflicted you have heard, O Yahweh. 
PSA.10.17	You will make their heart secure. You will listen attentively
PSA.10.18	to render judgment for the fatherless and the oppressed 
PSA.10.18	so that a mere mortal from the earth will no longer cause terror. 
PSA.11.1	In Yahweh I have taken refuge; 
PSA.11.1	how can you say to my soul, 
PSA.11.1	“Flee to your mountain like a bird”? 
PSA.11.2	For look: The wicked string the bow.
PSA.11.2	They have fitted their arrow to the string, 
PSA.11.2	to shoot from the darkness 
PSA.11.2	at the upright of heart. 
PSA.11.3	When the foundations are destroyed 
PSA.11.3	what can the righteous do?
PSA.11.4	Yahweh is in his holy temple; 
PSA.11.4	Yahweh is in the heavens on his throne. 
PSA.11.4	His eyelids see; 
PSA.11.4	they test the children of humankind. 
PSA.11.5	Yahweh tests the righteous, 
PSA.11.5	but the wicked and the lover of violence 
PSA.11.5	his soul hates. 
PSA.11.6	He will rain coals
PSA.11.6	Burning sulfur and scorching wind 
PSA.11.6	will be the portion of their cup. 
PSA.11.7	For Yahweh is righteous; 
PSA.11.7	he loves righteous deeds. 
PSA.11.7	The upright shall see his face. 
PSA.12.1	Save, O Yahweh, for the pious have ceased to be; 
PSA.12.1	for the faithful have vanished 
PSA.12.1	from among the children of humankind. 
PSA.12.2	They speak falseness to each other.
PSA.12.2	With flattering lips, 
PSA.12.2	with a double heart
PSA.12.3	May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, 
PSA.12.3	the tongue speaking great boasts— 
PSA.12.4	those who say, “With our tongue we will prevail. 
PSA.12.4	Our lips are on our side. 
PSA.12.4	Who is master over us?” 
PSA.12.5	“Because of the oppression of the afflicted, 
PSA.12.5	because of the groaning of the poor, 
PSA.12.5	now I will rise up,” Yahweh says. 
PSA.12.5	“I shall put them in the safety for which they
PSA.12.6	The words of Yahweh are pure words 
PSA.12.6	like silver refined in the crucible on the ground, 
PSA.12.6	refined seven times. 
PSA.12.7	You, O Yahweh, will protect them. 
PSA.12.7	You will preserve him
PSA.12.7	from this generation always. 
PSA.12.8	The wicked prowl about 
PSA.12.8	when vileness is exalted among the children of humankind. 
PSA.13.1	How long, O Yahweh? Will you forget me forever? 
PSA.13.1	How long will you hide your face from me? 
PSA.13.2	How long must I take counsel
PSA.13.2	and sorrow in my heart all the day? 
PSA.13.2	How long will my enemy be exalted over me? 
PSA.13.3	Consider
PSA.13.3	Give light to my eyes 
PSA.13.3	lest I sleep the sleep of death, 
PSA.13.4	and lest my enemy should say, “I have overcome him,” 
PSA.13.4	lest my enemies rejoice because I am shaken. 
PSA.13.5	But as for me, I have trusted in your steadfast love.
PSA.13.5	My heart will rejoice in your deliverance. 
PSA.13.6	 I will sing to Yahweh 
PSA.13.6	because he has dealt bountifully with me. 
PSA.14.1	The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” 
PSA.14.1	They are corrupt. 
PSA.14.1	They do abominable deeds. 
PSA.14.1	There is none who does good. 
PSA.14.2	Yahweh looks down from heaven upon the children of humankind 
PSA.14.2	to see whether there is one who has insight, 
PSA.14.2	one who cares about God. 
PSA.14.3	All have gone astray; 
PSA.14.3	they are altogether corrupt. 
PSA.14.3	There is not one who does good; 
PSA.14.3	there is not even one. 
PSA.14.4	All who do evil—do they not know, 
PSA.14.4	they who eat my people as though they were eating bread? 
PSA.14.4	They do not call on Yahweh. 
PSA.14.5	There they are very fearful
PSA.14.5	because God is with the generation of the righteous. 
PSA.14.6	You would put to shame the plan of the poor, 
PSA.14.6	because
PSA.14.7	Oh that from Zion
PSA.14.7	When Yahweh returns the fortunes of his people, 
PSA.14.7	Jacob will rejoice; Israel will be happy. 
PSA.15.1	O Yahweh, who may reside in your tent? 
PSA.15.1	Who may dwell on your holy mountain? 
PSA.15.2	He who walks blamelessly and does what is right. 
PSA.15.2	He who speaks honestly in his heart. 
PSA.15.3	He does not slander with his tongue. 
PSA.15.3	He does not harm his friend, 
PSA.15.3	nor bring up
PSA.15.4	In his eyes a rejected one is contemptible, 
PSA.15.4	but he honors those who respect Yahweh. 
PSA.15.4	He takes an oath to his own injury and does not retract it. 
PSA.15.5	He does not lend his money at interest, 
PSA.15.5	and does not take a bribe against the innocent. 
PSA.15.5	He who does these things 
PSA.15.5	will never be shaken. 
PSA.16.1	Protect me, O God, 
PSA.16.1	for I take refuge in you. 
PSA.16.2	Oh my soul you have said
PSA.16.2	I have no good apart from you.” 
PSA.16.3	With regard to the saints who are in the land, 
PSA.16.3	they are the noble ones in whom is all my desire. 
PSA.16.4	Those who hurry after
PSA.16.4	I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood, 
PSA.16.4	nor take up their names on my lips. 
PSA.16.5	Yahweh is the portion which is my share and my cup. 
PSA.16.5	You hold my lot. 
PSA.16.6	The measuring lines have fallen for me in pleasant places. 
PSA.16.6	Yes, my inheritance is delightful for me. 
PSA.16.7	I will bless Yahweh who advises me; 
PSA.16.7	yes, at night my innermost being
PSA.16.8	I have set Yahweh before me always. 
PSA.16.8	Because he is at my right hand I will not be shaken. 
PSA.16.9	Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices. 
PSA.16.9	Yes, my body will dwell in safety, 
PSA.16.10	for you will not abandon my soul to Sheol; 
PSA.16.10	you will not give your faithful one to see the grave. 
PSA.16.11	You will make known to me the path of life. 
PSA.16.11	In your presence is fullness of joy. 
PSA.16.11	At your right hand are pleasures forever. 
PSA.17.1	O Yahweh, hear a just cause. 
PSA.17.1	Hear my cry; heed my prayer 
PSA.17.1	I make without deceitful lips. 
PSA.17.2	Let my vindication come forth from you; 
PSA.17.2	let your eyes see fairness. 
PSA.17.3	You have tried my heart; 
PSA.17.3	you have examined me by night; 
PSA.17.3	you have tested me; you found nothing. 
PSA.17.3	I have decided that my mouth will not transgress. 
PSA.17.4	As for the works of humankind, 
PSA.17.4	by the word of your lips, 
PSA.17.4	I have kept from the ways of the violent. 
PSA.17.5	I have held my steps in your path 
PSA.17.5	My feet will not slip. 
PSA.17.6	As for me, I have called on you 
PSA.17.6	because you will answer me, O God. 
PSA.17.6	Incline your ear to me. 
PSA.17.6	Hear my words.
PSA.17.7	Show wondrously your acts of loyal love, 
PSA.17.7	O Savior of those who take refuge 
PSA.17.7	at your right hand
PSA.17.7	from those who rise up against them. 
PSA.17.8	Keep me as the apple of your eye.
PSA.17.8	Hide me in the shadow of your wings 
PSA.17.9	from the presence
PSA.17.9	those enemies against my life, 
PSA.17.9	they that surround me. 
PSA.17.10	They have shut off their calloused
PSA.17.10	with their mouth they speak arrogantly. 
PSA.17.11	Now they surround us at our every step. 
PSA.17.11	They intend
PSA.17.11	to pin
PSA.17.12	He is like
PSA.17.12	and like a strong lion crouching in hiding places. 
PSA.17.13	Rise up, O Yahweh, confront him.
PSA.17.13	Make him bow down. 
PSA.17.13	Rescue with your sword my life from the wicked, 
PSA.17.14	from men by your hand, O Yahweh, from men of this world. 
PSA.17.14	Their share is in this life,
PSA.17.14	They are satisfied with children. 
PSA.17.14	They bequeath their excess to their children. 
PSA.17.15	By contrast, I in righteousness shall see your face. 
PSA.17.15	Upon awakening I will be satisfied seeing your form. 
PSA.18.1	And he said: 
PSA.18.1	“I love you, O Yahweh, my strength.” 
PSA.18.2	Yahweh is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, 
PSA.18.2	my God, my rock in whom I have taken refuge, 
PSA.18.2	my shield and the horn of my deliverance, my stronghold. 
PSA.18.3	I called upon Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised, 
PSA.18.3	and I was saved from my enemies. 
PSA.18.4	The ropes of death encircled me, 
PSA.18.4	and streams of ruin overwhelmed me. 
PSA.18.5	The ropes of Sheol surrounded me; 
PSA.18.5	the snares of death confronted me. 
PSA.18.6	In my trouble I called on Yahweh, 
PSA.18.6	and to my God I cried for help. 
PSA.18.6	He heard my voice from his temple, 
PSA.18.6	and my cry for help 
PSA.18.6	came up before his presence into his ears. 
PSA.18.7	Then the earth shook and quaked, 
PSA.18.7	and the foundations of the mountains trembled, 
PSA.18.7	and they staggered because he was angry. 
PSA.18.8	Smoke went forth from his nose, 
PSA.18.8	and fire from his mouth consumed. 
PSA.18.8	Burning coals blazed from him. 
PSA.18.9	So he bowed the heavens and came down 
PSA.18.9	with a thick cloud under his feet. 
PSA.18.10	And he mounted a cherub and flew, 
PSA.18.10	and he swooped down on wings of wind. 
PSA.18.11	He made darkness his hiding place; 
PSA.18.11	all about him his covering 
PSA.18.11	was a darkness of waters, thick clouds.
PSA.18.12	From the brightness before him 
PSA.18.12	his clouds passed over 
PSA.18.12	with hail and coals of fire. 
PSA.18.13	And Yahweh thundered from the heavens, 
PSA.18.13	and the Most High uttered his voice 
PSA.18.13	with hail and coals of fire. 
PSA.18.14	And he shot his arrows and scattered them,
PSA.18.14	and many lightning bolts and routed them. 
PSA.18.15	Then the channels of the sea became visible, 
PSA.18.15	and the foundations of the world were uncovered 
PSA.18.15	by your rebuke, O Yahweh, 
PSA.18.15	by the blast
PSA.18.16	He reached
PSA.18.16	He drew me from many waters. 
PSA.18.17	He delivered me from my strong enemy, 
PSA.18.17	and from those who hated me 
PSA.18.17	because they were stronger than I. 
PSA.18.18	They confronted me on the day of disaster, 
PSA.18.18	but Yahweh was my support. 
PSA.18.19	So he brought me out to a spacious place. 
PSA.18.19	He delivered me because he delighted in me. 
PSA.18.20	Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness; 
PSA.18.20	According to the cleanness of my hands 
PSA.18.20	he has repaid me. 
PSA.18.21	Because I have kept the ways of Yahweh, 
PSA.18.21	and have not acted wickedly against my God, 
PSA.18.22	because all his ordinances are before me, 
PSA.18.22	and his statutes I have not removed from me, 
PSA.18.23	and I was blameless before him, 
PSA.18.23	and I kept myself from my guilt. 
PSA.18.24	Therefore Yahweh has repaid me according to my righteousness, 
PSA.18.24	according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight. 
PSA.18.25	To the loyal you show yourself loyal. 
PSA.18.25	To the blameless you show yourself blameless. 
PSA.18.26	To the pure you show yourself pure. 
PSA.18.26	but to the wicked you show yourself shrewd. 
PSA.18.27	For you deliver humble people, 
PSA.18.27	but haughty eyes you humiliate. 
PSA.18.28	For you light my lamp; 
PSA.18.28	Yahweh, my God, lights up my darkness. 
PSA.18.29	For with you I can charge a troop, 
PSA.18.29	and with my God I can scale a wall. 
PSA.18.30	This
PSA.18.30	The word of Yahweh is flawless.
PSA.18.30	He is a shield for all those who take refuge in him. 
PSA.18.31	For who is God apart from Yahweh, 
PSA.18.31	and who is a rock except our God? 
PSA.18.32	The God who girded me with strength, 
PSA.18.32	and made safe
PSA.18.33	he made my feet like the deer’s, 
PSA.18.33	and on my high places he makes me stand. 
PSA.18.34	He trains my hands for war, 
PSA.18.34	so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. 
PSA.18.35	You also gave me the shield of your salvation, 
PSA.18.35	and your right hand supported me, 
PSA.18.35	and your humility made me great. 
PSA.18.36	You enlarged my step under me, 
PSA.18.36	and my ankles did not slip. 
PSA.18.37	I chased my enemies and overtook them; 
PSA.18.37	I did not turn back until they were finished off. 
PSA.18.38	I struck them and they were not able to stand up; 
PSA.18.38	they fell under my feet. 
PSA.18.39	And you girded me with strength for the battle; 
PSA.18.39	those rising against me you made to kneel under me. 
PSA.18.40	And you made my enemies turn their backs,
PSA.18.40	then I destroyed those who hated me. 
PSA.18.41	They cried out but there was no rescuer, 
PSA.18.41	even to Yahweh, but he did not answer them. 
PSA.18.42	And I ground them like dust in the wind,
PSA.18.42	I emptied them
PSA.18.43	You rescued me from strife with people; 
PSA.18.43	you set me as head (over) nations. 
PSA.18.43	People I did not know served me; 
PSA.18.44	as soon as they heard,
PSA.18.44	The children of a foreign land feigned obedience before me. 
PSA.18.45	The children of a foreign land lost heart,
PSA.18.45	and they came trembling from their strongholds. 
PSA.18.46	Yahweh lives, and blessed be my rock, 
PSA.18.46	and may the God of my salvation be exalted— 
PSA.18.47	the God who executed vengeance for me, 
PSA.18.47	and subdued peoples under me, 
PSA.18.48	who delivered me from my enemies. 
PSA.18.48	Indeed, you exalted me higher than those who rose against me. 
PSA.18.48	You delivered me from the man of violence. 
PSA.18.49	Therefore I will give thanks to you among the nations, O Yahweh, 
PSA.18.49	and I will sing the praise of your name: 
PSA.18.50	the one who makes great victories for his king, 
PSA.18.50	and who shows loyal love for his anointed, 
PSA.18.50	to David and to his descendants forever. 
PSA.19.1	The heavens are telling the glory of God, 
PSA.19.1	and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands. 
PSA.19.2	Every day
PSA.19.2	and every night
PSA.19.3	There is no speech and there are no words; 
PSA.19.3	their sound is inaudible. 
PSA.19.4	Yet in all the world their line
PSA.19.4	and their words to the end of the world. 
PSA.19.4	In them
PSA.19.5	and it is like a bridegroom 
PSA.19.5	who comes out of his bridal chamber. 
PSA.19.5	It is glad like a strong man 
PSA.19.5	to run its course. 
PSA.19.6	Its rising is from one
PSA.19.6	and its circuit to the other end
PSA.19.6	and nothing is hidden from its heat. 
PSA.19.7	The law of Yahweh is perfect, reviving life.
PSA.19.7	The testimony of Yahweh is firm, making wise the simple. 
PSA.19.8	The precepts of Yahweh are right, making the heart rejoice. 
PSA.19.8	The command of Yahweh is pure, enlightening the eyes. 
PSA.19.9	The fear of Yahweh is pure, enduring forever. 
PSA.19.9	The ordinances of Yahweh are true; they are righteous altogether, 
PSA.19.10	more desirable than gold, even much fine gold; 
PSA.19.10	and sweeter than honey, even honey in the comb. 
PSA.19.11	Moreover, your servant is warned
PSA.19.11	in keeping them is great reward. 
PSA.19.12	Who can perceive his errors? 
PSA.19.12	Acquit me from hidden faults. 
PSA.19.13	Also, keep back your servant from arrogant sins;
PSA.19.13	let them not rule over me. 
PSA.19.13	Then I shall be blameless, 
PSA.19.13	and I shall be innocent of great transgression. 
PSA.19.14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart 
PSA.19.14	be acceptable in your presence, 
PSA.19.14	O Yahweh, my rock and my redeemer. 
PSA.20.1	May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble. 
PSA.20.1	May the name of Jacob’s God protect
PSA.20.2	May he send you help
PSA.20.2	and from Zion may he sustain you. 
PSA.20.3	May he remember all your offerings, 
PSA.20.3	and your burnt offering may he regard favorably.
PSA.20.4	May he give to you your heart’s desire,
PSA.20.4	and your every plan may he fulfill. 
PSA.20.5	May we shout for joy over your victory, 
PSA.20.5	and in the name of our God may we set up banners. 
PSA.20.5	May Yahweh fulfill all your requests. 
PSA.20.6	Now I know that Yahweh will help his anointed.
PSA.20.6	He will answer him from his holy heaven 
PSA.20.6	with the victorious power of his right hand. 
PSA.20.7	Some boast in chariots and others in horses,
PSA.20.7	but we boast in the name of Yahweh, our God. 
PSA.20.8	They will collapse and fall, 
PSA.20.8	and we will rise and stand firm. 
PSA.20.9	Rescue,
PSA.20.9	Let the king answer us when we call. 
PSA.21.1	O Yahweh, the king will rejoice in your strength, 
PSA.21.1	and how greatly he will delight in your help.
PSA.21.2	You have given him the desire of his heart, 
PSA.21.2	and have not withheld the request of his lips. 
PSA.21.3	For you meet him with blessings of good things. 
PSA.21.3	You set on his head a crown of fine gold. 
PSA.21.4	He asked life from you; you gave it to him— 
PSA.21.4	length of days forever and ever. 
PSA.21.5	His honor is great because of your help.
PSA.21.5	Splendor and majesty you have bestowed upon him. 
PSA.21.6	For you set on him blessings forever. 
PSA.21.6	You make him glad with the joy of your presence. 
PSA.21.7	Because the king trusts Yahweh, 
PSA.21.7	and through the steadfast love
PSA.21.7	he shall not be moved. 
PSA.21.8	Your hand will find all your enemies; 
PSA.21.8	your right hand will find those who hate you. 
PSA.21.9	You will make them like your fiery furnace 
PSA.21.9	at the time of your appearance. 
PSA.21.9	Yahweh will swallow them in his wrath 
PSA.21.9	and fire will consume them. 
PSA.21.10	You will destroy their offspring
PSA.21.10	and their descendants
PSA.21.11	Though they have plotted
PSA.21.11	though they have planned a scheme, they will not prevail. 
PSA.21.12	For you will turn them to flight;
PSA.21.12	you will aim arrows on your bowstrings at their faces. 
PSA.21.13	Be exalted, O Yahweh, in your strength, 
PSA.21.13	and we sing and praise your power. 
PSA.22.1	My God, my God why have you forsaken me? 
PSA.22.1	Why are you far from helping me, far from the words of my groaning? 
PSA.22.2	O my God, I call by day and you do not answer, 
PSA.22.2	and by night but I have no rest.
PSA.22.3	Yet you are holy, 
PSA.22.3	enthroned on the praises of Israel. 
PSA.22.4	Our ancestors
PSA.22.4	they trusted and you delivered them. 
PSA.22.5	They cried to you and were saved; 
PSA.22.5	they trusted you and were not ashamed. 
PSA.22.6	But I am a worm and not a man, 
PSA.22.6	scorned by humankind and despised by people. 
PSA.22.7	All who see me mock me. 
PSA.22.7	They open wide their lips; 
PSA.22.7	they shake the head, saying: 
PSA.22.8	“He trusts Yahweh.
PSA.22.8	Let him deliver him because he delights in him.” 
PSA.22.9	Yet you took me from the belly; 
PSA.22.9	you made me trust while on my mother’s breasts. 
PSA.22.10	On you I was cast from the womb. 
PSA.22.10	From my mother’s belly you have been my God. 
PSA.22.11	Do not be far from me 
PSA.22.11	because trouble is near; 
PSA.22.11	because there is no helper. 
PSA.22.12	Many bulls have encircled me; 
PSA.22.12	mighty bulls of Bashan have surrounded me. 
PSA.22.13	They open their mouth against me 
PSA.22.13	like a lion tearing and roaring. 
PSA.22.14	I am poured out like water, 
PSA.22.14	and all my bones are out of joint. 
PSA.22.14	My heart is like wax; 
PSA.22.14	it is melted within me.
PSA.22.15	My strength is dry like a potsherd, 
PSA.22.15	and my tongue is sticking to my jaws; 
PSA.22.15	and you have placed me in the dust of death. 
PSA.22.16	Because dogs have surrounded me; 
PSA.22.16	a gang of evildoers has encircled me. 
PSA.22.16	Like the lion
PSA.22.17	I can count all my bones; 
PSA.22.17	they gaze, they look at me. 
PSA.22.18	They divide my garments among them, 
PSA.22.18	and for my clothing they cast lots.
PSA.22.19	But you, O Yahweh, do not remain distant. 
PSA.22.19	O my help, hasten to help me. 
PSA.22.20	Rescue my life from the sword, 
PSA.22.20	my only life from the power of the dogs.
PSA.22.21	Save me from the mouth of the lion, 
PSA.22.21	and from the horns of the wild oxen answer me. 
PSA.22.22	I will tell your name to my brothers; 
PSA.22.22	inside the assembly I will praise you. 
PSA.22.23	You who revere Yahweh, praise him! 
PSA.22.23	Glorify him, all you seed of Jacob, 
PSA.22.23	and be in awe of him, all you seed of Israel, 
PSA.22.24	because he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, 
PSA.22.24	and has not hid his face from him; 
PSA.22.24	but he listened to him when he cried for help. 
PSA.22.25	From you is my praise. 
PSA.22.25	In the great assembly, 
PSA.22.25	I will pay my vows before those who revere him. 
PSA.22.26	The afflicted will eat and will be satisfied. 
PSA.22.26	Those who seek him will praise Yahweh. 
PSA.22.26	May your
PSA.22.27	All the ends of the earth 
PSA.22.27	will remember and turn to Yahweh. 
PSA.22.27	All the families of the nations 
PSA.22.27	will worship before you. 
PSA.22.28	Because the kingship belongs to Yahweh, 
PSA.22.28	and he rules over the nations. 
PSA.22.29	All the healthy ones
PSA.22.29	Before him all of those descending into the dust will kneel, 
PSA.22.29	even he who cannot keep his soul alive. 
PSA.22.30	Descendants
PSA.22.30	Regarding the Lord, it will be told to the next generation. 
PSA.22.31	They will come and tell his saving
PSA.22.31	to a people yet to be born, that he has done it. 
PSA.23.1	Yahweh is my shepherd; 
PSA.23.1	I will not lack for anything. 
PSA.23.2	In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; 
PSA.23.2	by quiet waters he leads me. 
PSA.23.3	He restores my life.
PSA.23.3	He leads me in correct paths
PSA.23.3	for the sake of his name. 
PSA.23.4	Even when I walk in a dark valley, I fear no evil 
PSA.23.4	because you are with me. 
PSA.23.4	Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 
PSA.23.5	You prepare before me a table 
PSA.23.5	in the presence of my oppressors. 
PSA.23.5	You anoint my head with oil; 
PSA.23.5	my cup is overflowing. 
PSA.23.6	Surely goodness and loyal love will pursue me 
PSA.23.6	all the days of my life, 
PSA.23.6	and I will stay
PSA.23.6	for a very long time.
PSA.24.1	The earth is Yahweh’s, with its fullness, 
PSA.24.1	the world and those who live in it, 
PSA.24.2	because he has founded it on the seas, 
PSA.24.2	and has established it on the rivers. 
PSA.24.3	Who may ascend the mountain of Yahweh? 
PSA.24.3	And who may stand in his holy place? 
PSA.24.4	He who is innocent of hands and pure of heart, 
PSA.24.4	who does not lift up his soul to falseness, 
PSA.24.4	and does not swear deceitfully. 
PSA.24.5	He will receive blessing from Yahweh, 
PSA.24.5	and justice
PSA.24.6	Such is the sort of those who seek
PSA.24.6	those who seek your face, even Jacob. 
PSA.24.7	Lift up your heads, O gates, 
PSA.24.7	and rise up, O ancient doorways, 
PSA.24.7	that the king of glory
PSA.24.8	Who is the king of glory?
PSA.24.8	Yahweh, strong and mighty; 
PSA.24.8	Yahweh, mighty in war! 
PSA.24.9	Lift up your heads, O gates, 
PSA.24.9	and lift up, O ancient doorways, 
PSA.24.9	that the king of glory
PSA.24.10	Who is the king of glory?
PSA.24.10	Yahweh of hosts, 
PSA.24.10	He is the king of glory!
PSA.25.1	To you, O Yahweh, I lift up my soul. 
PSA.25.2	O my God, I trust you; let me not be put to shame. 
PSA.25.2	Do not let my enemies exult over me. 
PSA.25.3	Indeed, none who wait for you should be put to shame. 
PSA.25.3	Those who betray without cause should be put to shame. 
PSA.25.4	Make me know your ways, O Yahweh. 
PSA.25.4	Teach me your paths. 
PSA.25.5	Cause me to walk in your truth and teach me, 
PSA.25.5	because you are the God of my salvation. 
PSA.25.5	I await you all day long.
PSA.25.6	Remember your compassion, O Yahweh, 
PSA.25.6	and your acts of loyal love, 
PSA.25.6	because they are from of old. 
PSA.25.7	Do not remember 
PSA.25.7	the sins of my youth or my transgressions. 
PSA.25.7	According to your loyal love remember me if you will, 
PSA.25.7	for the sake of your goodness, O Yahweh. 
PSA.25.8	Good and right is Yahweh; 
PSA.25.8	therefore he instructs sinners in the way. 
PSA.25.9	He causes the humble to walk in justice, 
PSA.25.9	and teaches the humble his way. 
PSA.25.10	All the paths of Yahweh are loyal love and faithfulness 
PSA.25.10	for those who keep his covenant and statutes.
PSA.25.11	Also, for the sake of your name, O Yahweh, 
PSA.25.11	forgive my sin, because it is great. 
PSA.25.12	Who is the man fearing Yahweh? 
PSA.25.12	He will instruct him in the way he should choose. 
PSA.25.13	His soul will lodge in prosperity, 
PSA.25.13	and his offspring will possess the land. 
PSA.25.14	Intimate fellowship with Yahweh is for those who fear him, 
PSA.25.14	and he makes known his covenant to them. 
PSA.25.15	My eyes are continually toward Yahweh, 
PSA.25.15	because he will take my feet from the net. 
PSA.25.16	Turn to me and have mercy on me 
PSA.25.16	because I am lonely and afflicted. 
PSA.25.17	Remove the troubles of my heart; 
PSA.25.17	bring me out from my distresses. 
PSA.25.18	Consider my affliction and trouble, 
PSA.25.18	and forgive
PSA.25.19	Consider that my enemies are many, 
PSA.25.19	and they hate me with violent hatred. 
PSA.25.20	Protect my life and deliver me. 
PSA.25.20	Let me not be put to shame, because I take shelter in you. 
PSA.25.21	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, 
PSA.25.21	because I wait for you. 
PSA.25.22	O God, redeem Israel 
PSA.25.22	from all its troubles. 
PSA.26.1	Judge me, O Yahweh, because I have walked in my integrity, 
PSA.26.1	and I have trusted Yahweh and not wavered. 
PSA.26.2	Prove me, O Yahweh, and test me. 
PSA.26.2	Try my innermost being
PSA.26.3	Because your loyal love is before my eyes, 
PSA.26.3	and I walk about in your faithfulness. 
PSA.26.4	I do not sit with deceitful people, 
PSA.26.4	nor will I go about with hypocrites. 
PSA.26.5	I hate the crowd of evildoers, 
PSA.26.5	and with the wicked I will not sit. 
PSA.26.6	I will wash my hands in innocence, 
PSA.26.6	and I will walk about your altar, O Yahweh, 
PSA.26.7	to declare with a voice of thanksgiving, 
PSA.26.7	and tell of all your wondrous deeds. 
PSA.26.8	O Yahweh, I love the dwelling of your house,
PSA.26.8	and the place where your glory abides.
PSA.26.9	Do not destroy me
PSA.26.9	nor my life with men of bloodshed, 
PSA.26.10	in whose hands is an evil plan, 
PSA.26.10	and whose right hand is full of bribes.
PSA.26.11	But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. 
PSA.26.11	Redeem me and be gracious to me. 
PSA.26.12	My foot stands on level ground. 
PSA.26.12	In assemblies I will bless Yahweh. 
PSA.27.1	Yahweh is my light and my salvation; 
PSA.27.1	whom shall I fear? 
PSA.27.1	Yahweh is the refuge of my life; 
PSA.27.1	of whom shall I be afraid? 
PSA.27.2	When evildoers drew near against me to eat my flesh— 
PSA.27.2	my adversaries and my enemies who drew near to me— 
PSA.27.2	they themselves stumbled and fell. 
PSA.27.3	Though an army encamp against me, 
PSA.27.3	my heart will not fear. 
PSA.27.3	Though war arise against me, 
PSA.27.3	even in this I will remain confident. 
PSA.27.4	One thing I have asked from Yahweh; 
PSA.27.4	it I will seek: 
PSA.27.4	that I may dwell in the house
PSA.27.4	to behold the beauty of Yahweh, 
PSA.27.4	and to consider
PSA.27.5	Because he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble. 
PSA.27.5	He will conceal me in the hiding place of his tent. 
PSA.27.5	He will set me high upon a rock. 
PSA.27.6	And now my head will be high over my enemies round about me. 
PSA.27.6	And I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy. 
PSA.27.6	I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh. 
PSA.27.7	Hear, O Yahweh, my voice when I call, 
PSA.27.7	and be gracious to me and answer me. 
PSA.27.8	On your behalf my heart says, “Seek my face.” 
PSA.27.8	Your face, O Yahweh, I do seek. 
PSA.27.9	Do not hide your face from me; 
PSA.27.9	do not turn your servant away in anger. 
PSA.27.9	You have been my help; do not abandon nor forsake me, 
PSA.27.9	O God of my salvation. 
PSA.27.10	If my father or my mother forsake me, 
PSA.27.10	then Yahweh will receive me. 
PSA.27.11	Teach me, O Yahweh, your way, 
PSA.27.11	and lead me on a level path because of my enemies. 
PSA.27.12	Do not give me over to the desire of my enemies, 
PSA.27.12	because false witnesses have arisen against me, 
PSA.27.12	and each breathing out violence.
PSA.27.13	Surely
PSA.27.13	in the land of the living. 
PSA.27.14	Wait for Yahweh. 
PSA.27.14	Be strong and let your heart show strength, 
PSA.27.14	and wait for Yahweh. 
PSA.28.1	To you, O Yahweh, I call. 
PSA.28.1	O my rock, do not be deaf to me. 
PSA.28.1	Or else, if you are silent to me, 
PSA.28.1	then I will become like those descending to the pit. 
PSA.28.2	Hear the voice of my supplications 
PSA.28.2	when I cry to you for help, 
PSA.28.2	when I lift up my hands 
PSA.28.2	toward your holy inner sanctuary. 
PSA.28.3	Do not drag me away with the wicked 
PSA.28.3	or with the workers of evil, 
PSA.28.3	who speak of peace with their neighbors, 
PSA.28.3	while evil is in their heart. 
PSA.28.4	Give to them according to their work, 
PSA.28.4	even according to the evil of their deeds. 
PSA.28.4	Give to them according to the work of their hands; 
PSA.28.4	repay them their rightful due. 
PSA.28.5	Because they do not regard the works of Yahweh, 
PSA.28.5	nor the work of his hands, 
PSA.28.5	he will destroy them 
PSA.28.5	and not rebuild them. 
PSA.28.6	Blessed is Yahweh, 
PSA.28.6	because he has heard the voice of my supplications. 
PSA.28.7	Yahweh is my strength and my shield. 
PSA.28.7	My heart trusts him and I am helped. 
PSA.28.7	So my heart rejoices, 
PSA.28.7	and with my song I will give thanks to him. 
PSA.28.8	Yahweh is their strength, 
PSA.28.8	and he is the refuge for the salvation of his anointed one. 
PSA.28.9	Save your people 
PSA.28.9	and bless your heritage. 
PSA.28.9	Shepherd them also and carry them always. 
PSA.29.1	Ascribe to Yahweh, O sons of God,
PSA.29.1	ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength. 
PSA.29.2	Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due
PSA.29.2	Worship Yahweh in holy array. 
PSA.29.3	The voice of Yahweh is over the waters; 
PSA.29.3	the God of glory thunders. 
PSA.29.3	Yahweh is over many waters. 
PSA.29.4	The voice of Yahweh is powerful. 
PSA.29.4	The voice of Yahweh is majestic. 
PSA.29.5	The voice of Yahweh breaks the cedars. 
PSA.29.5	Yahweh shatters even the cedars of Lebanon. 
PSA.29.6	And he makes them skip like a calf; 
PSA.29.6	Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox. 
PSA.29.7	The voice of Yahweh flashes
PSA.29.8	The voice of Yahweh shakes the wilderness. 
PSA.29.8	Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. 
PSA.29.9	The voice of Yahweh causes deer
PSA.29.9	and strips the forests bare. 
PSA.29.9	And at his temple all in it say, “Glory!” 
PSA.29.10	Yahweh sits enthroned at the flood, 
PSA.29.10	and Yahweh sits as king forever. 
PSA.29.11	May Yahweh give strength to his people. 
PSA.29.11	May Yahweh bless his people with peace. 
PSA.30.1	I will exalt you, O Yahweh, 
PSA.30.1	because you have drawn me up, 
PSA.30.1	and have not made my enemies rejoice over me. 
PSA.30.2	O Yahweh, my God, 
PSA.30.2	I cried for help to you, 
PSA.30.2	and you healed me. 
PSA.30.3	O Yahweh, you have brought my life up from Sheol. 
PSA.30.3	You preserved me alive 
PSA.30.3	from among those going down 
PSA.30.4	Sing praises to Yahweh, you his faithful ones, 
PSA.30.4	and give thanks to his holy fame.
PSA.30.5	For there is a moment in his anger; 
PSA.30.5	there is a lifetime in his favor. 
PSA.30.5	Weeping lodges for the evening, 
PSA.30.5	but in the morning comes rejoicing. 
PSA.30.6	But as for me, I had said in my prosperity, 
PSA.30.6	“I shall not be moved ever.” 
PSA.30.7	O Yahweh, by your favor 
PSA.30.7	you caused my strong mountain to stand. 
PSA.30.7	You hid your face. I was bewildered. 
PSA.30.8	To you, O Yahweh, I called, 
PSA.30.8	and to the Lord I pleaded for grace saying, 
PSA.30.9	“What gain is there in my death,
PSA.30.9	in my going down into the pit? 
PSA.30.9	Will the dust praise you? 
PSA.30.9	Will it tell of your faithfulness? 
PSA.30.10	“O Yahweh, hear and be gracious to me. 
PSA.30.10	O Yahweh, be my helper.” 
PSA.30.11	You have turned my wailing into my dancing. 
PSA.30.11	You have removed my sackcloth 
PSA.30.11	and clothed me with joy 
PSA.30.12	so that I
PSA.30.12	and not be quiet. 
PSA.30.12	O Yahweh, my God, 
PSA.30.12	I will give thanks to you forever. 
PSA.31.1	In you, O Yahweh, I have taken refuge. 
PSA.31.1	Let me not be put to shame ever. 
PSA.31.1	Deliver me by your righteousness. 
PSA.31.2	Incline your ear to me. 
PSA.31.2	Quickly deliver me. 
PSA.31.2	Become my rock of refuge, 
PSA.31.2	a fortified keep
PSA.31.3	For you are my rock and my fortress. 
PSA.31.3	So, for the sake of your name, 
PSA.31.3	lead me and guide me. 
PSA.31.4	Bring me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, 
PSA.31.4	for you are my refuge. 
PSA.31.5	Into your hand I commit my spirit. 
PSA.31.5	You have redeemed me, O Yahweh, faithful God.
PSA.31.6	I hate those devoted to useless idols, 
PSA.31.6	but I trust Yahweh. 
PSA.31.7	I will exult and rejoice in your loyal love. 
PSA.31.7	Because you have seen my misery, 
PSA.31.7	you know the distresses of my life.
PSA.31.8	And you have not delivered me 
PSA.31.8	into the hand of the enemy. 
PSA.31.8	You have set my feet in a broad place. 
PSA.31.9	Be gracious to me, O Yahweh, 
PSA.31.9	because I have distress. 
PSA.31.9	My eye wastes away because of vexation, 
PSA.31.9	along with my soul and my body.
PSA.31.10	For my life is at an end with sorrow, 
PSA.31.10	and my years with sighing. 
PSA.31.10	My strength stumbles because of my iniquity, 
PSA.31.10	and my bones waste away. 
PSA.31.11	Because of all my adversaries I have become a disgrace, 
PSA.31.11	especially to my neighbors, 
PSA.31.11	and a dread to my acquaintances. 
PSA.31.11	Those who see me in the street flee from me. 
PSA.31.12	I have become forgotten like one dead, out of mind.
PSA.31.12	I am like a destroyed vessel. 
PSA.31.13	For I hear the rumor of many, 
PSA.31.13	“Terror on every side!” 
PSA.31.13	When conspiring together against me, 
PSA.31.13	they have plotted to take my life. 
PSA.31.14	But as for me, I trust you, O Yahweh. 
PSA.31.14	I say, “You are my God.” 
PSA.31.15	My times
PSA.31.15	Deliver me from the hand of my enemies 
PSA.31.15	and from those who pursue me. 
PSA.31.16	Shine your face upon your servant. 
PSA.31.16	Save me by your loyal love. 
PSA.31.17	O Yahweh, let me not be put to shame, for I call on you. 
PSA.31.17	Let the wicked be put to shame. 
PSA.31.17	Let them go silently
PSA.31.18	Let lying lips be dumb, 
PSA.31.18	that speak against the righteous
PSA.31.18	with arrogance and contempt. 
PSA.31.19	How abundant is your goodness 
PSA.31.19	that you have stored up for those who fear you, 
PSA.31.19	that you perform for those who take refuge in you 
PSA.31.19	before the children of humankind. 
PSA.31.20	You will hide them in the protection of your presence 
PSA.31.20	from the plots of man. 
PSA.31.20	You will hide them in a shelter from the strife of tongues. 
PSA.31.21	Blessed is Yahweh, 
PSA.31.21	because he has worked marvelously his loyal love to me 
PSA.31.21	in a besieged city. 
PSA.31.22	As for me, I said in my alarm, 
PSA.31.22	“I am cut off from before your eyes.” 
PSA.31.22	However you heard the voice of my supplications 
PSA.31.22	when I cried to you for help. 
PSA.31.23	Love Yahweh, all you his faithful ones. 
PSA.31.23	Yahweh preserves the faithful 
PSA.31.23	but repays abundantly the one who acts arrogantly. 
PSA.31.24	Be strong and let your
PSA.31.24	all you who wait for Yahweh. 
PSA.32.1	Happy is he whose transgression is taken away, 
PSA.32.1	whose sin is covered. 
PSA.32.2	Happy is a person to whom Yahweh does not impute iniquity 
PSA.32.2	and in whose spirit there is not deceit. 
PSA.32.3	When I kept silent, my bones were worn out 
PSA.32.3	due to my groaning all the day. 
PSA.32.4	For day and night your hand was heavy upon me. 
PSA.32.4	My vigor was changed into the dry heat of summer. 
PSA.32.5	I made known my sin to you, and my iniquity I did not cover. 
PSA.32.5	I said, “I will confess concerning my transgressions to Yahweh,” 
PSA.32.5	and you took away the guilt of my sin. 
PSA.32.6	Therefore let all the faithful pray to you 
PSA.32.6	at the time for finding you. 
PSA.32.6	Surely at the flood of many waters they will not reach him. 
PSA.32.7	You are my hiding place; 
PSA.32.7	from trouble you preserve me. 
PSA.32.7	With cries of deliverance you surround me. 
PSA.32.8	I
PSA.32.8	in the way that you should go. 
PSA.32.8	I will advise you with my eye upon you. 
PSA.32.9	Do not be like a horse or like a mule, without understanding; 
PSA.32.9	that needs his tackle—bridle and rein—for restraint 
PSA.32.9	or he would not come near you. 
PSA.32.10	Many are the pains of the wicked, 
PSA.32.10	but for the one who trusts Yahweh 
PSA.32.10	loyal love surrounds him. 
PSA.32.11	Be glad in Yahweh and rejoice, you righteous, 
PSA.32.11	and shout for joy, all you upright of heart. 
PSA.33.1	Exult in Yahweh, O you righteous, 
PSA.33.1	for praise is fitting for the upright. 
PSA.33.2	Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre; 
PSA.33.2	with a harp of ten strings play to him. 
PSA.33.3	Sing to him a new song; 
PSA.33.3	play skillfully with jubilant shout. 
PSA.33.4	For the word of Yahweh is upright, 
PSA.33.4	and all his work is done in faithfulness. 
PSA.33.5	He loves righteousness and justice. 
PSA.33.5	The earth is full of the loyal love of Yahweh. 
PSA.33.6	By the word of Yahweh the heavens were made, 
PSA.33.6	and by the breath of his mouth all their host. 
PSA.33.7	He gathered the waters of the sea like a heap. 
PSA.33.7	He put the deeps in storehouses. 
PSA.33.8	Let all the earth fear Yahweh. 
PSA.33.8	Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. 
PSA.33.9	For he himself spoke
PSA.33.9	He himself commanded
PSA.33.10	Yahweh brings to nothing
PSA.33.10	he frustrates
PSA.33.11	The plan of Yahweh stands firm forever, 
PSA.33.11	the intents of his heart from one generation to the next.
PSA.33.12	Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh, 
PSA.33.12	the people he has chosen for his inheritance. 
PSA.33.13	From heaven Yahweh looks; 
PSA.33.13	he sees all the children of humankind. 
PSA.33.14	From his dwelling place
PSA.33.14	on all the inhabitants of the earth, 
PSA.33.15	he who fashions altogether their heart, 
PSA.33.15	he who understands all their works. 
PSA.33.16	The king is not saved by the greatness of an army. 
PSA.33.16	The warrior is not delivered by the greatness of strength. 
PSA.33.17	The horse is a false hope for victory, 
PSA.33.17	nor can it save by the greatness of its power. 
PSA.33.18	Behold, the eye of Yahweh is on those who fear him, 
PSA.33.18	on those who hope
PSA.33.19	to deliver their soul from death 
PSA.33.19	and to keep them alive in famine. 
PSA.33.20	Our soul waits for Yahweh; 
PSA.33.20	he is our help and our shield. 
PSA.33.21	For in him our heart rejoices 
PSA.33.21	because in his holy name we trust. 
PSA.33.22	Let your loyal love, O Yahweh, be upon us, 
PSA.33.22	even as
PSA.34.1	I will bless Yahweh at all times; 
PSA.34.1	his praise shall be in my mouth continually. 
PSA.34.2	My soul makes its boast in Yahweh; 
PSA.34.2	let the humble hear and be glad. 
PSA.34.3	Magnify Yahweh with me, 
PSA.34.3	and let us exalt his name together. 
PSA.34.4	I sought Yahweh and he answered me, 
PSA.34.4	and from all my terrors he delivered me. 
PSA.34.5	They looked to him and were radiant, 
PSA.34.5	and their faces shall not be ashamed.
PSA.34.6	This poor man called and Yahweh heard, 
PSA.34.6	and saved him from all his troubles. 
PSA.34.7	The angel of Yahweh encamps 
PSA.34.7	around those who fear him, 
PSA.34.7	and he rescues them. 
PSA.34.8	Taste and see that Yahweh is good; 
PSA.34.8	blessed is the man who takes refuge in him. 
PSA.34.9	Fear Yahweh, you his saints,
PSA.34.9	for there is no lack for those who fear him. 
PSA.34.10	The young lions are in want and suffer hunger, 
PSA.34.10	but those who seek Yahweh will not lack for any good thing. 
PSA.34.11	Come, you children, listen to me; 
PSA.34.11	I will teach you the fear of Yahweh. 
PSA.34.12	Who is the man who desires life, 
PSA.34.12	who loves many days in order to see good? 
PSA.34.13	Keep your tongue from evil 
PSA.34.13	and your lips from speaking deceit. 
PSA.34.14	Turn from evil and do good. 
PSA.34.14	Seek peace and pursue it. 
PSA.34.15	The eyes of Yahweh are toward the righteous, 
PSA.34.15	and his ears toward their cry for help. 
PSA.34.16	The face of Yahweh is against evildoers, 
PSA.34.16	to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. 
PSA.34.17	They
PSA.34.17	and delivers them from all of their troubles. 
PSA.34.18	Yahweh is near to those who are heartbroken 
PSA.34.18	and saves those who are crushed in spirit. 
PSA.34.19	Many are the distresses of the righteous, 
PSA.34.19	but Yahweh delivers him out of them all. 
PSA.34.20	He protects all his bones; 
PSA.34.20	not one of them is broken. 
PSA.34.21	Evil will slay the wicked, 
PSA.34.21	and those who hate the righteous will incur guilt. 
PSA.34.22	Yahweh redeems the life of his servants, 
PSA.34.22	and none who take refuge in him will incur guilt. 
PSA.35.1	Contend, O Yahweh, with my contenders; 
PSA.35.1	fight those who fight me. 
PSA.35.2	Grasp buckler and shield 
PSA.35.2	and rise to my aid. 
PSA.35.3	And draw the spear and javelin to meet those who pursue me. 
PSA.35.3	Say to my soul, “I am your salvation.” 
PSA.35.4	Let those who seek my life be shamed and humiliated. 
PSA.35.4	Let those who plot calamity against me be repulsed and ashamed. 
PSA.35.5	Let them be like chaff before the wind, 
PSA.35.5	with the angel of Yahweh driving them.
PSA.35.6	Let their way be dark and slippery, 
PSA.35.6	with the angel of Yahweh pursuing them. 
PSA.35.7	For without cause they secretly hide the pit with their net for me; 
PSA.35.7	without cause they dug it for my life. 
PSA.35.8	Let unforeseen ruin
PSA.35.8	and his net that he hid, let it catch him. 
PSA.35.8	Let him fall into it in ruin. 
PSA.35.9	Then my soul will rejoice in Yahweh; 
PSA.35.9	it will rejoice in his salvation. 
PSA.35.10	All of my bones shall say, “O Yahweh, who is like you, 
PSA.35.10	who delivers the poor from one stronger than he 
PSA.35.10	and the poor and needy from the one who robs him?” 
PSA.35.11	Violent witnesses rise up; 
PSA.35.11	they ask me concerning what I do not know. 
PSA.35.12	They repay me evil in place of good. 
PSA.35.12	It is bereavement to my soul. 
PSA.35.13	But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth. 
PSA.35.13	I weakened my soul with fasting, 
PSA.35.13	and my prayer returned to me unanswered.
PSA.35.14	I behaved
PSA.35.14	As one lamenting a mother, I was bowed down in mourning. 
PSA.35.15	But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered together; 
PSA.35.15	smiters whom I did not know gathered against me. 
PSA.35.15	They tore and did not cease. 
PSA.35.16	Among the ungodly of the mockers at feasts,
PSA.35.16	they gnashed at me with their teeth. 
PSA.35.17	My Lord, how long will you watch? 
PSA.35.17	Restore my life from their ravages,
PSA.35.17	my only life from the young lions. 
PSA.35.18	I will give thanks to you in the great assembly; 
PSA.35.18	among the mighty people I will praise you. 
PSA.35.19	Let not those who are wrongfully my enemies
PSA.35.19	Nor let those who hate me without cause wink the eye. 
PSA.35.20	For they do not speak peace, 
PSA.35.20	but against the quiet ones of the land 
PSA.35.20	they plan deceitful words. 
PSA.35.21	They also made wide their mouths
PSA.35.21	They said, “Aha! Aha! 
PSA.35.21	Our eyes have seen it.” 
PSA.35.22	You have seen, O Yahweh. Do not be deaf. 
PSA.35.22	O Lord, do not be far from me. 
PSA.35.23	Wake up and rouse yourself for my right, 
PSA.35.23	for my cause, O my God and my Lord. 
PSA.35.24	Vindicate me according to your righteousness, 
PSA.35.24	O Yahweh my God, 
PSA.35.24	and do not let them rejoice over me. 
PSA.35.25	Do not let them say in their hearts,
PSA.35.25	Let them not say, “We have swallowed him up.” 
PSA.35.26	Let them be shamed and abashed altogether, 
PSA.35.26	who rejoice at my misfortune. 
PSA.35.26	Let them put on shame and insult, 
PSA.35.26	who magnify themselves against me. 
PSA.35.27	Let them shout for joy and be glad, 
PSA.35.27	who delight in my vindication; 
PSA.35.27	and let them say continually, “Yahweh is great, 
PSA.35.27	who delights in the welfare of his servant.” 
PSA.35.28	Then my tongue will proclaim your righteousness, 
PSA.35.28	and your praise all day. 
PSA.36.1	An oracle: the wicked has rebellion 
PSA.36.1	in the midst of his
PSA.36.1	There is no fear of God before his eyes. 
PSA.36.2	For he flatters himself in his eyes, 
PSA.36.2	hating to detect his iniquity.
PSA.36.3	The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit. 
PSA.36.3	He has ceased to have insight and to do good. 
PSA.36.4	He plans sin on his bed. 
PSA.36.4	He puts himself on a way that is not good. 
PSA.36.4	He does not reject evil. 
PSA.36.5	O Yahweh, your loyal love extends into the heavens, 
PSA.36.5	your faithfulness unto the clouds. 
PSA.36.6	Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains,
PSA.36.6	your judgments like the great deep. 
PSA.36.6	You save man and beast, O Yahweh. 
PSA.36.7	How precious is your loyal love, O God, 
PSA.36.7	and the children of humankind 
PSA.36.7	take refuge in the shadow of your wings. 
PSA.36.8	They are refreshed with the fullness
PSA.36.8	and you give them drink from the river of your delights. 
PSA.36.9	For with you is the fountain of life; 
PSA.36.9	in your light we see light. 
PSA.36.10	Prolong your loyal love to those who know you, 
PSA.36.10	and your righteousness to the upright of heart. 
PSA.36.11	Do not let a foot of pride come against me, 
PSA.36.11	nor let a wicked hand make me to wander homeless. 
PSA.36.12	There doers of evil have fallen; 
PSA.36.12	they are thrust down and not able to rise. 
PSA.37.1	Do not fret because of evildoers; 
PSA.37.1	do not be envious of doers of wickedness. 
PSA.37.2	For like the grass they will dry up quickly, 
PSA.37.2	and like green vegetation they will wither. 
PSA.37.3	Trust Yahweh and do good. 
PSA.37.3	Abide in the land and feed on faithfulness.
PSA.37.4	Take pleasure in Yahweh as well, 
PSA.37.4	and he will give to you the requests of your heart. 
PSA.37.5	Commit to
PSA.37.5	Trust also on him and he will act. 
PSA.37.6	Then he will bring forth your righteousness like the light, 
PSA.37.6	and your justice like the noonday. 
PSA.37.7	Be quiet before Yahweh and wait for him. 
PSA.37.7	Do not fret about one who succeeds in his way, 
PSA.37.7	about a man making plots. 
PSA.37.8	Refrain from anger and forsake wrath. 
PSA.37.8	Do not fret; it only brings evil. 
PSA.37.9	For evildoers will be cut off, 
PSA.37.9	but those who wait for Yahweh— 
PSA.37.9	they will possess the land. 
PSA.37.10	And
PSA.37.10	and you will look carefully upon his place, but he will not be. 
PSA.37.11	But the afflicted will possess the land, 
PSA.37.11	and they will take pleasure in an abundance of peace. 
PSA.37.12	The wicked plans evil against the righteous, 
PSA.37.12	and gnashes at him with his teeth. 
PSA.37.13	The Lord laughs at him, 
PSA.37.13	for he sees that his day is coming. 
PSA.37.14	The wicked have drawn the sword and have bent their bow 
PSA.37.14	to throw down the poor and the needy, 
PSA.37.14	to kill those upright in their way. 
PSA.37.15	Their sword will enter into their own heart, 
PSA.37.15	and their bows shall be broken. 
PSA.37.16	The little belonging to the righteous is better 
PSA.37.16	than the wealth of many wicked. 
PSA.37.17	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, 
PSA.37.17	but Yahweh supports the righteous. 
PSA.37.18	Yahweh knows the days of the blameless, 
PSA.37.18	and their inheritance will be forever. 
PSA.37.19	They will not be put to shame in distressing times,
PSA.37.19	and in the days of famine they will be satisfied. 
PSA.37.20	But the wicked will perish, 
PSA.37.20	and the enemies of Yahweh will be like the splendor of the pastures. 
PSA.37.20	They vanish; in smoke they vanish. 
PSA.37.21	The wicked borrows and does not repay, 
PSA.37.21	but the righteous is gracious and gives. 
PSA.37.22	For those blessed by him shall possess the land, 
PSA.37.22	but those cursed by him shall be cut off. 
PSA.37.23	The steps of a man are established by Yahweh, 
PSA.37.23	and he takes pleasure in his way. 
PSA.37.24	Though he fall, he will not be cast headlong, 
PSA.37.24	for Yahweh supports him with his hand. 
PSA.37.25	I was a youth, but I am now old; 
PSA.37.25	yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken 
PSA.37.25	or his children begging for
PSA.37.26	All the day he is gracious and lends, 
PSA.37.26	and his children are a blessing. 
PSA.37.27	Turn aside from evil and do good 
PSA.37.27	and so abide forever. 
PSA.37.28	For Yahweh loves justice 
PSA.37.28	and will not forsake his faithful ones. 
PSA.37.28	They are protected forever. 
PSA.37.28	But the children of the wicked will be cut off. 
PSA.37.29	The righteous will possess the land 
PSA.37.29	and abide in it forever. 
PSA.37.30	The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, 
PSA.37.30	and his tongue speaks justice. 
PSA.37.31	The law of his God is in his heart. 
PSA.37.31	His steps will not slip. 
PSA.37.32	The wicked watches for the righteous 
PSA.37.32	and seeks to kill him. 
PSA.37.33	Yahweh will not abandon him into his hand, 
PSA.37.33	and he will not let him be condemned when he is judged. 
PSA.37.34	Wait for Yahweh and keep his way, 
PSA.37.34	and he will exalt you to possess the land. 
PSA.37.34	When the wicked are cut off, you will see it. 
PSA.37.35	I have seen the wicked acting violently 
PSA.37.35	and spreading himself out 
PSA.37.35	like a luxuriant native tree. 
PSA.37.36	Then he passed on
PSA.37.36	And I sought him, but he could not be found. 
PSA.37.37	Observe the blameless and look at the upright, 
PSA.37.37	for there is a future for a man of peace. 
PSA.37.38	But transgressors shall be destroyed altogether. 
PSA.37.38	The future of the wicked shall be cut off. 
PSA.37.39	And
PSA.37.39	their refuge in the time of trouble. 
PSA.37.40	And Yahweh helps them and he rescues them. 
PSA.37.40	He rescues them from the wicked and saves them, 
PSA.37.40	because they take refuge in him. 
PSA.38.1	O Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger 
PSA.38.1	or chastise me in your wrath. 
PSA.38.2	For your arrows have sunk into me, 
PSA.38.2	and your hand has pressed down on me. 
PSA.38.3	There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation. 
PSA.38.3	There is no health in my bones because of my sin. 
PSA.38.4	For my iniquities have passed over my head; 
PSA.38.4	like a heavy burden they are too heavy for me. 
PSA.38.5	My wounds start to stink; they rot 
PSA.38.5	because of my foolishness. 
PSA.38.6	I am bowed down; I am bent over greatly. 
PSA.38.6	All the day I go about mourning. 
PSA.38.7	For my loins are full of burning, 
PSA.38.7	and there is no soundness in my flesh. 
PSA.38.8	I am faint and crushed greatly; 
PSA.38.8	I groan because of the roaring of my heart. 
PSA.38.9	O Lord, all my longing is before you, 
PSA.38.9	and my sighing is not hidden from you. 
PSA.38.10	My heart throbs violently, my strength leaves me; 
PSA.38.10	and the light of my eyes, that also is not with me. 
PSA.38.11	My friends and companions stand aloof from my affliction, 
PSA.38.11	and my relatives stand afar off. 
PSA.38.12	Those who seek my life lay snares as well, 
PSA.38.12	and those intent on my harm speak threats. 
PSA.38.12	They also plot deceit all day. 
PSA.38.13	But as for me, like the deaf I cannot hear, 
PSA.38.13	and I am like the mute who cannot open his mouth. 
PSA.38.14	And so I am like a man who hears not, 
PSA.38.14	and in whose mouth there are no retorts. 
PSA.38.15	Rather for you I wait, O Yahweh. 
PSA.38.15	You will answer, O Lord my God. 
PSA.38.16	For I said, “Help, lest they rejoice over me, 
PSA.38.16	lest they boast against me when my foot slips.” 
PSA.38.17	For I am ready to stumble, 
PSA.38.17	and my pain is before me continually. 
PSA.38.18	For my iniquity I confess; 
PSA.38.18	I am anxious because of my sin. 
PSA.38.19	And my enemies without cause
PSA.38.19	and those who hate me wrongfully
PSA.38.20	And those who repay evil in return for good 
PSA.38.20	accuse me in return for my pursuing good. 
PSA.38.21	Do not forsake me, O Yahweh. 
PSA.38.21	O my God, do not be far from me. 
PSA.38.22	Hurry to help me, 
PSA.38.22	O Lord, my salvation. 
PSA.39.1	I said, “I will guard my ways 
PSA.39.1	that I may not sin
PSA.39.1	I will keep a muzzle over my mouth 
PSA.39.1	as long as the wicked are before me.” 
PSA.39.2	I was mute with silence. I was silent even from saying good things, 
PSA.39.2	and my pain was stirred up. 
PSA.39.3	My heart grew hot inside me; 
PSA.39.3	in my sighing a fire burned. 
PSA.39.3	Then I spoke with my tongue, 
PSA.39.4	“Let me know, O Yahweh, my end, 
PSA.39.4	and what is the measure of my days. 
PSA.39.4	Let me know how transient I am.” 
PSA.39.5	Look, you have made my days mere handbreadths, 
PSA.39.5	and my lifespan as nothing next to you. 
PSA.39.5	Surely every person standing firm is complete vanity. 
PSA.39.6	Surely a man walks about as a mere shadow;
PSA.39.6	surely in vain they bustle about. 
PSA.39.6	He heaps up possessions but does not know who will gather them in. 
PSA.39.7	And now, O Lord, for what do I wait? 
PSA.39.7	My hope is for you. 
PSA.39.8	From all my transgressions deliver me; 
PSA.39.8	do not make me the taunt of the fool. 
PSA.39.9	I am mute. I do not open my mouth, 
PSA.39.9	for you, yourself, have done it. 
PSA.39.10	Remove from me your affliction. 
PSA.39.10	By the opposition of your hand I perish. 
PSA.39.11	When with rebukes you chastise a man for sin, 
PSA.39.11	you
PSA.39.11	Surely everyone is a mere vapor.
PSA.39.12	Hear my prayer, O Yahweh, and listen to my cry for help; 
PSA.39.12	do not be deaf to my tears. 
PSA.39.12	For I am an alien
PSA.39.12	a sojourner like all my ancestors.
PSA.39.13	Look away from me that I may be cheerful, 
PSA.39.13	before I depart and I am no more. 
PSA.40.1	I waited patiently for Yahweh, 
PSA.40.1	And he inclined to me 
PSA.40.1	and heard my cry for help. 
PSA.40.2	And so he brought me up from the roaring pit,
PSA.40.2	from the miry clay. 
PSA.40.2	And he put my feet upon a rock; 
PSA.40.2	he made my steps steady. 
PSA.40.3	Then he put a new song in my mouth, 
PSA.40.3	a praise to our God. 
PSA.40.3	Many will see and fear, 
PSA.40.3	and will trust Yahweh. 
PSA.40.4	Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust 
PSA.40.4	and does not turn to the proud and to those who fall away to a lie.
PSA.40.5	Many things, O Yahweh my God, you have done— 
PSA.40.5	your wonderful deeds and your thoughts toward us. 
PSA.40.5	There is none to compare with you. 
PSA.40.5	If I tried to proclaim and tell of them, 
PSA.40.5	they would be too numerous to count. 
PSA.40.6	A sacrifice and offering you do not desire. 
PSA.40.6	My ears you have opened.
PSA.40.6	Burnt offering and sin offering you have not demanded. 
PSA.40.7	Then I said, “Look, I come. 
PSA.40.7	In the scroll of the book 
PSA.40.7	it is written concerning me: 
PSA.40.8	‘I delight to do your will, O my God, 
PSA.40.8	and your law is deep within me.’ ”
PSA.40.9	I have brought good tidings of righteousness in the great congregation. 
PSA.40.9	Look, I have not shut my lips. 
PSA.40.9	O Yahweh, you surely know that.
PSA.40.10	Your righteousness I have not hidden in the midst of my heart. 
PSA.40.10	I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation. 
PSA.40.10	I have not concealed your loyal love or your faithfulness 
PSA.40.10	from the great congregation. 
PSA.40.11	As for you, O Yahweh, do not withhold your mercies from me. 
PSA.40.11	Let your loyal love and your faithfulness 
PSA.40.11	continually preserve me. 
PSA.40.12	For evils without number have encompassed me. 
PSA.40.12	My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to see. 
PSA.40.12	They are more than the hairs of my head, 
PSA.40.12	and my heart fails me. 
PSA.40.13	Be pleased, O Yahweh, to deliver me. 
PSA.40.13	O Yahweh, hurry to help me. 
PSA.40.14	Let them be shamed and abashed altogether 
PSA.40.14	who seek to take away my life.
PSA.40.14	Let them be repulsed and humiliated 
PSA.40.14	who desire my harm. 
PSA.40.15	Let them be appalled because of their shame, 
PSA.40.15	those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” 
PSA.40.16	Let them rejoice and be glad in you, 
PSA.40.16	all those who seek you. 
PSA.40.16	Let them say continually, “Yahweh is great!” 
PSA.40.16	—those who love your salvation. 
PSA.40.17	But I am poor and needy. 
PSA.40.17	Let my Lord consider me. 
PSA.40.17	You are my help and my deliverer. 
PSA.40.17	O my God, do not delay. 
PSA.41.1	Blessed is the one who has regard for the poor; 
PSA.41.1	in the day of disaster, Yahweh delivers him. 
PSA.41.2	Yahweh protects him and keeps him alive; 
PSA.41.2	he is blessed in the land, 
PSA.41.2	and you do not give him 
PSA.41.2	into the will
PSA.41.3	Yahweh sustains him on his sick bed. 
PSA.41.3	In his illness, you restore to health.
PSA.41.4	As for me, I said, “O Yahweh, be gracious to me. 
PSA.41.4	Heal me,
PSA.41.5	My enemies speak evil about me, 
PSA.41.5	“When will he die and his name perish?” 
PSA.41.6	And when one comes to see me, he speaks falsely; 
PSA.41.6	his heart gathers disaster for itself. 
PSA.41.6	He goes out to the street; he speaks. 
PSA.41.7	All who hate me speak together against me. 
PSA.41.7	Against me they assume the worst
PSA.41.8	“A ruinous thing is poured out on him, 
PSA.41.8	and now that he lies down, he will not rise up again.” 
PSA.41.9	Even my close friend,
PSA.41.9	who ate my bread, 
PSA.41.9	has lifted his heel against me. 
PSA.41.10	But you, O Yahweh, be gracious to me and raise me up 
PSA.41.10	that I may repay them. 
PSA.41.11	By this I know that you delight in me: 
PSA.41.11	because my enemy has not shouted in triumph over me. 
PSA.41.12	As for me, you have upheld me in my integrity, 
PSA.41.12	and you have set me in your presence forever. 
PSA.41.13	Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, 
PSA.41.13	from everlasting to everlasting. 
PSA.41.13	Amen and Amen. 
PSA.42.1	As a deer longs for streams of water, 
PSA.42.1	so my soul longs for you, O God. 
PSA.42.2	My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. 
PSA.42.2	When shall I come and appear before God?
PSA.42.3	My tears have been my food day and night, 
PSA.42.3	while they say to me all day long, 
PSA.42.3	“Where is your God?” 
PSA.42.4	These I remember and I pour out my soul within me: 
PSA.42.4	that I would go with the multitude; 
PSA.42.4	I led them in procession to the house
PSA.42.4	with a voice of rejoicing and thanksgiving, 
PSA.42.4	a crowd celebrating a festival. 
PSA.42.5	Why are you in despair,
PSA.42.5	and disturbed within me? 
PSA.42.5	Hope in God, because I will again praise him, 
PSA.42.5	for the salvation of his presence. 
PSA.42.6	O my God, within me my soul is in despair;
PSA.42.6	therefore I remember you from the land of Jordan 
PSA.42.6	and the heights of Hermon, from the mountain of Mizar. 
PSA.42.7	Deep is calling to deep 
PSA.42.7	at
PSA.42.7	All your breakers and your waves 
PSA.42.7	have passed over me. 
PSA.42.8	By day Yahweh commands his loyal love, 
PSA.42.8	and in the night his song is with me, 
PSA.42.8	a prayer to the God of my life. 
PSA.42.9	I say to God, my rock, 
PSA.42.9	“Why have you forgotten me? 
PSA.42.9	Why must I walk about mourning 
PSA.42.9	because of the oppression of the enemy?” 
PSA.42.10	As with a shattering in my bones 
PSA.42.10	my oppressors taunt me, 
PSA.42.10	while they say to me all day,
PSA.42.10	“Where is your God?” 
PSA.42.11	Why are you in despair,
PSA.42.11	And why are you disturbed within me? 
PSA.42.11	Hope in God, because I shall again praise him, 
PSA.42.11	my salvation
PSA.43.1	Judge me, O God, and plead my case 
PSA.43.1	against
PSA.43.1	From a man of deceit and wickedness rescue me, 
PSA.43.2	because you are the God of my refuge. 
PSA.43.2	Why have you rejected me? 
PSA.43.2	Why must I go about mourning 
PSA.43.2	because of the oppression of the enemy? 
PSA.43.3	Send your light and your truth; 
PSA.43.3	they shall lead
PSA.43.3	They shall bring me to your holy mountain
PSA.43.3	and to your dwelling places. 
PSA.43.4	Then
PSA.43.4	to God, my surpassing joy,
PSA.43.4	and I will praise you with lyre, 
PSA.43.4	O God, my God. 
PSA.43.5	Why are you in despair,
PSA.43.5	And why are you disturbed within me? 
PSA.43.5	Hope in God, because I will again praise him, 
PSA.43.5	my salvation
PSA.44.1	O God, we have heard with our ears; 
PSA.44.1	our ancestors
PSA.44.1	of work you worked in their days, 
PSA.44.1	in days of old. 
PSA.44.2	You with your hand drove out the nations, 
PSA.44.2	but them
PSA.44.2	You harmed the peoples, 
PSA.44.2	but them
PSA.44.3	For not with their sword 
PSA.44.3	did they possess the land, 
PSA.44.3	and their arm did not give them victory. 
PSA.44.3	Rather it was your right hand and your arm 
PSA.44.3	and the light of your presence, 
PSA.44.3	because you delighted in them. 
PSA.44.4	You are my king, O God. 
PSA.44.4	Command
PSA.44.5	By you we push down our enemies; 
PSA.44.5	by your name we tread down those who rise up against us. 
PSA.44.6	For I do not trust my bow, 
PSA.44.6	and my sword cannot give me victory. 
PSA.44.7	Rather you have saved us from our enemies,
PSA.44.7	and have humiliated those who hate us. 
PSA.44.8	In God we boast all the day, 
PSA.44.8	and we will give thanks to your name forever. 
PSA.44.9	Surely you have rejected and disgraced us, 
PSA.44.9	and have not gone out with our armies. 
PSA.44.10	You have caused us to pull back from the enemy, 
PSA.44.10	and so those who hate us have plundered for themselves. 
PSA.44.11	You have given us as sheep for food, 
PSA.44.11	and among the nations you have scattered us. 
PSA.44.12	You have sold your people cheaply,
PSA.44.12	and did not profit by their price. 
PSA.44.13	You have made us a taunt to our neighbors, 
PSA.44.13	a derision and a scorn to those around us. 
PSA.44.14	You have made us a byword among the nations, 
PSA.44.14	a shaking of the head among the peoples. 
PSA.44.15	All day long
PSA.44.15	and the shame of my face covers me, 
PSA.44.16	because of the voice of the taunter and the reviler, 
PSA.44.16	because of the enemy and the avenger. 
PSA.44.17	All this has befallen us, though we have not forgotten you, 
PSA.44.17	and we have not been false to your covenant. 
PSA.44.18	Our heart has not turned back, 
PSA.44.18	and our steps have not turned aside from your way. 
PSA.44.19	But you have crushed us in a place of jackals, 
PSA.44.19	and have covered us with deep shadow. 
PSA.44.20	If we had forgotten the name of our God, 
PSA.44.20	or had spread out our hands in prayer to a foreign god, 
PSA.44.21	would not God discover this, 
PSA.44.21	for he knows the secrets of the heart? 
PSA.44.22	Rather, on account of you we are killed all day long;
PSA.44.22	we are accounted as sheep for slaughter. 
PSA.44.23	Wake up! Why do you sleep, O Lord? 
PSA.44.23	Awake! Do not reject forever. 
PSA.44.24	Why do you hide your face? 
PSA.44.24	Have you forgotten our misery and our oppression? 
PSA.44.25	For our soul is bowed down to the dust. 
PSA.44.25	Our body
PSA.44.26	Rise up! Be a help for us, 
PSA.44.26	and redeem us for the sake of your loyal love. 
PSA.45.1	My heart is moved with a good word; 
PSA.45.1	I recite my compositions
PSA.45.1	My tongue is the pen of a skilled scribe. 
PSA.45.2	You are the most handsome of the sons of humankind; 
PSA.45.2	grace is poured out on your lips; 
PSA.45.2	therefore God has blessed you forever. 
PSA.45.3	Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, 
PSA.45.3	in your splendor and your majesty. 
PSA.45.4	And in your majesty ride victoriously,
PSA.45.4	because of truth and humility and righteousness. 
PSA.45.4	And let your right hand teach you awesome deeds. 
PSA.45.5	Your arrows are sharp; 
PSA.45.5	peoples fall under you 
PSA.45.5	in the midst of the king’s enemies. 
PSA.45.6	Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. 
PSA.45.6	A scepter of uprightness is 
PSA.45.6	the scepter of your kingdom. 
PSA.45.7	You love righteousness and hate wickedness. 
PSA.45.7	Therefore God, your God, has anointed you 
PSA.45.7	from among your companions with festive oil. 
PSA.45.8	All your robes are scented with myrrh and aloes and cassia. 
PSA.45.8	From palaces of ivory stringed instruments gladden you. 
PSA.45.9	Kings’ daughters are among your noble ladies. 
PSA.45.9	The queen stands at your right hand in gold of Ophir. 
PSA.45.10	Hear, O daughter, and discern
PSA.45.10	and forget your people and your father’s house. 
PSA.45.11	Let the king desire your beauty.
PSA.45.11	Because he is your lord, therefore
PSA.45.12	Even the daughter of Tyre will come with a gift. 
PSA.45.12	The rich from among people will seek your favor.
PSA.45.13	The king’s daughter is all glorious within;
PSA.45.13	her garment is of gold embroidered cloth. 
PSA.45.14	She is brought to the king in colorful garments. 
PSA.45.14	The young women behind her, her attendants, 
PSA.45.14	are being brought to you. 
PSA.45.15	They are led with joy and gladness. 
PSA.45.15	They enter the palace of the king. 
PSA.45.16	In place of your
PSA.45.16	You will make them princes in all the land.
PSA.45.17	I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations; 
PSA.45.17	therefore peoples will praise you forever and ever. 
PSA.46.1	God is our refuge and strength, 
PSA.46.1	a very sufficient help in troubles. 
PSA.46.2	Therefore we will not fear though the earth change, 
PSA.46.2	and though the mountains totter into the midst
PSA.46.3	though its waters roar and foam, 
PSA.46.3	though mountains shake with its surging water. 
PSA.46.4	There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God, 
PSA.46.4	the holiest of the dwellings of the Most High. 
PSA.46.5	God is in the midst of her; 
PSA.46.5	she will not be made to totter. 
PSA.46.5	God will help her at daybreak.
PSA.46.6	Nations roar, kingdoms shake; 
PSA.46.6	he utters his voice, the earth melts. 
PSA.46.7	Yahweh of hosts is with us; 
PSA.46.7	our high stronghold is the God of Jacob. 
PSA.46.8	Come, see the works of Yahweh, 
PSA.46.8	who has placed desolations on the earth. 
PSA.46.9	He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth; 
PSA.46.9	he breaks the bow and cuts off the spear. 
PSA.46.9	The wagons of war he burns with fire. 
PSA.46.10	Be still, and know that I am God. 
PSA.46.10	I will be exalted among the nations; 
PSA.46.10	I will be exalted in the earth. 
PSA.46.11	Yahweh of Hosts is with us; 
PSA.46.11	the God of Jacob is our high stronghold. 
PSA.47.1	All you peoples, clap your hands.
PSA.47.1	Shout to God with a voice of rejoicing. 
PSA.47.2	For Yahweh Most High is awesome,
PSA.47.2	a great king over all the earth. 
PSA.47.3	He subdues peoples under us 
PSA.47.3	and nations under our feet. 
PSA.47.4	He chooses for us our inheritance, 
PSA.47.4	the pride of Jacob whom he loves. 
PSA.47.5	God has gone up with a shout, 
PSA.47.5	Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet. 
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to God, sing praises. 
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to our king, sing praises. 
PSA.47.7	For God is king of all the earth. 
PSA.47.7	Sing praises with understanding.
PSA.47.8	God reigns over nations; 
PSA.47.8	God sits on his holy throne. 
PSA.47.9	The princes of the peoples are gathered together 
PSA.47.9	with the people of Abraham’s God. 
PSA.47.9	For the shields of the earth belong to God. 
PSA.47.9	He is very exalted. 
PSA.48.1	Yahweh is great and very worthy of praise 
PSA.48.1	in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
PSA.48.2	Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, 
PSA.48.2	is Mount Zion,
PSA.48.2	the city of the great king. 
PSA.48.3	God is in her citadels; 
PSA.48.3	he is known as a high stronghold. 
PSA.48.4	For see, the kings assembled;
PSA.48.4	they advanced together. 
PSA.48.5	They themselves saw
PSA.48.5	They were terrified; they ran off. 
PSA.48.6	Trembling seized them there— 
PSA.48.6	pain as of a woman in labor. 
PSA.48.7	With an east wind 
PSA.48.7	you shatter
PSA.48.8	As we have heard, so we have seen 
PSA.48.8	in the city of Yahweh of hosts, in the city of our God. 
PSA.48.8	God will establish her forever. 
PSA.48.9	We have pondered your loyal love, O God, 
PSA.48.9	in the midst of your temple. 
PSA.48.10	As is your name, O God, so is your praise 
PSA.48.10	to the ends of the earth. 
PSA.48.10	Your right hand is full of righteousness. 
PSA.48.11	Let Mount Zion
PSA.48.11	let the daughters of Judah rejoice 
PSA.48.11	because of your judgments. 
PSA.48.12	Walk about Zion and circle it; 
PSA.48.12	count her towers. 
PSA.48.13	Consider well
PSA.48.13	Go through her citadels 
PSA.48.13	so that you can tell the next generation 
PSA.48.14	that this is God, our God forever and ever. 
PSA.48.14	He himself
PSA.49.1	Hear this, all you peoples; 
PSA.49.1	give ear, all you inhabitants of the world, 
PSA.49.2	both low and high, 
PSA.49.2	rich and poor together. 
PSA.49.3	My mouth will speak wisdom, 
PSA.49.3	and the meditation of my heart will be understanding. 
PSA.49.4	I will incline my ear to a proverb; 
PSA.49.4	I will propound
PSA.49.5	Why should I fear in times of calamity,
PSA.49.5	when iniquity surrounds me at my heels, 
PSA.49.6	those who trust their wealth 
PSA.49.6	and boast about the abundance of their riches? 
PSA.49.7	Surely a man cannot redeem a brother. 
PSA.49.7	He cannot give to God his ransom 
PSA.49.8	(since
PSA.49.8	and it always fails), 
PSA.49.9	so that he may stay alive forever 
PSA.49.9	and not see the pit. 
PSA.49.10	For he sees that the wise die, 
PSA.49.10	together with the fool and brute they perish, 
PSA.49.10	and leave their wealth to the next generation. 
PSA.49.11	Within them they think their houses are forever, 
PSA.49.11	their dwelling places from generation to generation. 
PSA.49.11	They name
PSA.49.12	But man cannot continue in his pomp. 
PSA.49.12	He is like the beasts that perish. 
PSA.49.13	This is the journey
PSA.49.13	and those after them who accept their sayings. 
PSA.49.14	Like sheep they are destined to Sheol; 
PSA.49.14	death will shepherd them. 
PSA.49.14	But the upright will rule over them in the morning, 
PSA.49.14	and their forms will be for Sheol to consume, 
PSA.49.14	far from his lofty abode. 
PSA.49.15	Surely God will ransom my life 
PSA.49.15	from the power
PSA.49.15	because he will receive me. 
PSA.49.16	Do not fear when a man becomes rich, 
PSA.49.16	when the wealth
PSA.49.17	because when he dies he will not take away any of it. 
PSA.49.17	His wealth will not follow down after him. 
PSA.49.18	Though he congratulated his soul while he was living 
PSA.49.18	—and people will praise you when you do well for yourself— 
PSA.49.19	it
PSA.49.19	Never will they see light. 
PSA.49.20	Humankind in its pomp, but does not understand, 
PSA.49.20	is like the beasts that perish. 
PSA.50.1	The Supreme God, God, Yahweh, has spoken 
PSA.50.1	and summoned the earth, 
PSA.50.1	from the rising of the sun 
PSA.50.1	to its setting. 
PSA.50.2	From Zion, the perfection of beauty, 
PSA.50.2	God shines forth. 
PSA.50.3	Our God comes and he is not silent. 
PSA.50.3	Before him fire devours, 
PSA.50.3	and around him it is very tempestuous. 
PSA.50.4	He summons the heavens above 
PSA.50.4	and the earth that he might judge his people: 
PSA.50.5	“Gather to me my loyal ones, 
PSA.50.5	those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.” 
PSA.50.6	And the heavens declare his righteousness, 
PSA.50.6	because God himself is judge. 
PSA.50.7	“Hear, O my people, and I will speak, 
PSA.50.7	O Israel, and I will testify against you. 
PSA.50.7	I am God, your God. 
PSA.50.8	It is not concerning a lack of your sacrifices that I rebuke you, 
PSA.50.8	and your burnt offerings are before me continually. 
PSA.50.9	I will not take from your house a bull 
PSA.50.9	or from your stalls a he-goat, 
PSA.50.10	because every animal of the forest is mine, 
PSA.50.10	the cattle on a thousand hills. 
PSA.50.11	I know every bird of the mountains, 
PSA.50.11	and every moving creature in the field is mine. 
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry I would not tell you, 
PSA.50.12	because the world and its fullness are mine. 
PSA.50.13	Do I eat the flesh of bulls 
PSA.50.13	or drink the blood of goats? 
PSA.50.14	Offer to God a thank offering 
PSA.50.14	and pay your vows to the Most High. 
PSA.50.15	And call me in the day of trouble; 
PSA.50.15	I will deliver you, and you will glorify me.” 
PSA.50.16	But to the wicked God says, 
PSA.50.16	“What right have you to recite my statutes 
PSA.50.16	and mention my covenant with your mouth,
PSA.50.17	while you yourself hate discipline, 
PSA.50.17	and cast my words behind you? 
PSA.50.18	When you see a thief, then you are pleased with him, 
PSA.50.18	and your association is with adulterers. 
PSA.50.19	You give your mouth free rein for evil, 
PSA.50.19	and you harness your tongue to deceit. 
PSA.50.20	You sit and speak against your brother; 
PSA.50.20	you slander your mother’s son. 
PSA.50.21	These things you have done, and I have been silent; 
PSA.50.21	You imagined that I was just like you. 
PSA.50.21	I will rebuke you and present an argument before your eyes. 
PSA.50.22	Now consider this, you who forget God, 
PSA.50.22	lest I tear you apart, and there will be none to deliver. 
PSA.50.23	He who sacrifices a thank offering honors me, 
PSA.50.23	and he who orders his way; 
PSA.50.23	I will show him the salvation of God.” 
PSA.51.1	Be gracious to me, O God, according to your loyal love. 
PSA.51.1	According to your abundant mercies, 
PSA.51.1	blot out my transgressions. 
PSA.51.2	Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, 
PSA.51.2	and from my sin cleanse me. 
PSA.51.3	For I myself know
PSA.51.3	and my sin is ever before me. 
PSA.51.4	Against you, only you, I have sinned 
PSA.51.4	and have done this evil
PSA.51.4	so that you are correct when you speak, 
PSA.51.4	you are blameless when you judge. 
PSA.51.5	Behold, in iniquity I was born, 
PSA.51.5	and in sin my mother conceived me. 
PSA.51.6	Behold, you delight in truth in the inward parts, 
PSA.51.6	and in the hidden parts you make me to know wisdom. 
PSA.51.7	Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean. 
PSA.51.7	Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
PSA.51.8	Make me hear joy and gladness; 
PSA.51.8	let the bones you have crushed rejoice. 
PSA.51.9	Hide your face from my sins, 
PSA.51.9	and all my iniquities blot out. 
PSA.51.10	Create a clean heart for me, O God, 
PSA.51.10	and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
PSA.51.11	Do not cast me away from your presence, 
PSA.51.11	and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. 
PSA.51.12	Restore to me the joy of your salvation, 
PSA.51.12	and with a willing spirit sustain me. 
PSA.51.13	Then I will teach transgressors your ways, 
PSA.51.13	and sinners will turn back to you. 
PSA.51.14	Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, 
PSA.51.14	the God of my salvation; 
PSA.51.14	then my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness. 
PSA.51.15	O Lord, open my lips, 
PSA.51.15	and my mouth will proclaim your praise. 
PSA.51.16	For you do not delight in sacrifice or I would give it. 
PSA.51.16	With a burnt offering you are not pleased. 
PSA.51.17	The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; 
PSA.51.17	A broken and contrite heart, 
PSA.51.17	O God, you will not despise. 
PSA.51.18	Do good in your favor toward Zion. 
PSA.51.18	Build the walls of Jerusalem. 
PSA.51.19	Then you will delight in righteous sacrifices, 
PSA.51.19	burnt offering and whole burnt offering. 
PSA.51.19	Then bulls will be offered on your altar. 
PSA.52.1	Why do you boast about evil, O mighty man? 
PSA.52.1	The loyal love of God endures continually.
PSA.52.2	Your tongue plans destruction, 
PSA.52.2	like a sharp razor, working deceit. 
PSA.52.3	You love evil more than good, 
PSA.52.3	a lie more than speaking what is right.
PSA.52.4	You love all devouring words, 
PSA.52.4	O deceitful tongue, 
PSA.52.5	but God will pull you down forever. 
PSA.52.5	He will snatch you and tear you away from your tent, 
PSA.52.5	and he will uproot you from the land of the living. 
PSA.52.6	And the righteous will see and fear, 
PSA.52.6	and will laugh at him, saying, 
PSA.52.7	“Look, the man who would not make God his refuge, 
PSA.52.7	but he trusted in the greatness of his wealth; 
PSA.52.7	he took refuge in his destructiveness.” 
PSA.52.8	But I am like an olive tree flourishing 
PSA.52.8	in the house
PSA.52.8	I trust the loyal love of God forever and ever. 
PSA.52.9	I will give thanks to you forever, because of what you have done, 
PSA.52.9	and I will wait on your name, because it is good, 
PSA.52.9	in the presence of your faithful ones. 
PSA.53.1	The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” 
PSA.53.1	They are corrupt and they have done abominable iniquity. 
PSA.53.1	There is none who does good. 
PSA.53.2	God looks down from heaven upon the children of humankind 
PSA.53.2	to see whether there is one who has insight, 
PSA.53.2	one who seeks God. 
PSA.53.3	All of them
PSA.53.3	They are altogether corrupt. 
PSA.53.3	There is none who does good; 
PSA.53.3	there is not even one. 
PSA.53.4	Do not evildoers know, 
PSA.53.4	they who eat my people as though they were eating bread? 
PSA.53.4	They do not call on God. 
PSA.53.5	There they are very fearful
PSA.53.5	where no fear had been, 
PSA.53.5	because God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you. 
PSA.53.5	You have put them to shame, because God has rejected them. 
PSA.53.6	Oh, that from Zion
PSA.53.6	When God returns the fortunes
PSA.53.6	let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad. 
PSA.54.1	O God, by your name save me, 
PSA.54.1	and by your power vindicate me. 
PSA.54.2	O God, hear my prayer; 
PSA.54.2	heed the words of my mouth. 
PSA.54.3	For foreigners have risen against me, 
PSA.54.3	and ruthless men seek my life. 
PSA.54.3	They have not set God before them. 
PSA.54.4	See, God is my helper; 
PSA.54.4	The Lord is with those who sustain my life.
PSA.54.5	He will repay
PSA.54.5	in your faithfulness destroy them. 
PSA.54.6	I will freely sacrifice to you; 
PSA.54.6	I will give thanks to your name, 
PSA.54.6	O Yahweh, because it is good. 
PSA.54.7	Because he has delivered me from all trouble, 
PSA.54.7	and my eye has looked with satisfaction on my enemies. 
PSA.55.1	Give ear, O God, to my prayer, 
PSA.55.1	and do not hide yourself from my plea. 
PSA.55.2	Attend to me and answer me. 
PSA.55.2	I am restless in my lamenting and I groan, 
PSA.55.3	because of the voice of an enemy, 
PSA.55.3	because of the oppression of the wicked, 
PSA.55.3	because they bring down evil on me, 
PSA.55.3	and in anger they hold a grudge against me. 
PSA.55.4	My heart trembles within me, 
PSA.55.4	and deathly terrors fall on me. 
PSA.55.5	Fear and trembling come on me, 
PSA.55.5	and horror overwhelms me. 
PSA.55.6	So I say, “Oh, that
PSA.55.6	I would fly away and be at rest. 
PSA.55.7	Look, I would flee far away. 
PSA.55.7	I would dwell in the wilderness. 
PSA.55.8	I would hurry to my refuge 
PSA.55.8	from the raging wind and storm.” 
PSA.55.9	Confuse, O Lord; divide their speech, 
PSA.55.9	because I see violence and strife in the city. 
PSA.55.10	Day and night they go around it on its walls, 
PSA.55.10	and iniquity and trouble are in its midst. 
PSA.55.11	Destruction is within it, 
PSA.55.11	and oppression and deceit 
PSA.55.11	do not depart from its public square. 
PSA.55.12	For it is not an enemy that taunts me, 
PSA.55.12	or I could bear it. 
PSA.55.12	It is not one who hates me that magnifies himself over me, 
PSA.55.12	or I could hide myself from him. 
PSA.55.13	But it is you, a man my equal, 
PSA.55.13	my friend and confidant. 
PSA.55.14	We who would take sweet counsel together; 
PSA.55.14	in the house
PSA.55.14	we would walk with the throng. 
PSA.55.15	Let death deceive them. May they descend to Sheol alive, 
PSA.55.15	because evil is in their home and heart.
PSA.55.16	As for me, I will call to God, 
PSA.55.16	and Yahweh will save me. 
PSA.55.17	Morning, noon and night
PSA.55.17	and he will hear my voice. 
PSA.55.18	He safely redeems my life from the battle against me,
PSA.55.18	because those standing against me are among many. 
PSA.55.19	God will hear and answer them,
PSA.55.19	he who is enthroned from of old, 
PSA.55.19	Because they do not change, 
PSA.55.19	and they do not fear God. 
PSA.55.20	He has put forth his hands against his friends;
PSA.55.20	he has defiled his covenant. 
PSA.55.21	The buttery words
PSA.55.21	but there was battle in his heart. 
PSA.55.21	His words were smoother than oil, 
PSA.55.21	but they were drawn swords. 
PSA.55.22	Cast your burden on Yahweh, 
PSA.55.22	and he will sustain you. 
PSA.55.22	He will never allow the righteous to be moved.
PSA.55.23	But you, O God, you will bring them down to the pit of corruption. 
PSA.55.23	The men of bloodshed and deceit will not live half their days, 
PSA.55.23	but I will trust you. 
PSA.56.1	Be gracious to me, O God, because humankind has trampled me; 
PSA.56.1	fighting all the day he oppresses me. 
PSA.56.2	My enemies
PSA.56.2	because many are attacking me proudly. 
PSA.56.3	When
PSA.56.4	God, whose word I praise, 
PSA.56.4	God I trust; I do not fear. 
PSA.56.4	What can mere flesh do to me? 
PSA.56.5	All day they twist my words; 
PSA.56.5	all their thoughts are against me for evil. 
PSA.56.6	They attack,
PSA.56.6	as they lie in wait for my life. 
PSA.56.7	Because of iniquity will they escape? 
PSA.56.7	In anger cast down the peoples, O God. 
PSA.56.8	You have kept count of my wonderings. 
PSA.56.8	Put my tears in your bottle; 
PSA.56.8	are they not in your book? 
PSA.56.9	Then my enemies will turn back when
PSA.56.9	This I know because
PSA.56.10	God, whose word I praise, 
PSA.56.10	Yahweh, whose word I praise, 
PSA.56.11	God I trust; I do not fear. 
PSA.56.11	What can mere humankind do to me? 
PSA.56.12	My vows to you, O God, are binding upon me. 
PSA.56.12	I will pay thank offerings to you, 
PSA.56.13	because you have delivered my soul from death. 
PSA.56.13	Have you not kept my feet from stumbling, 
PSA.56.13	that I may walk before God 
PSA.56.13	in the light of the living? 
PSA.57.1	Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me, 
PSA.57.1	because in you my soul takes refuge. 
PSA.57.1	In the shadow of your wings I will take refuge 
PSA.57.1	until destruction passes by. 
PSA.57.2	I will call to God Most High, 
PSA.57.2	to God who accomplishes things concerning me. 
PSA.57.3	He will send from heaven and save me; 
PSA.57.3	he will reproach the one who tramples me. 
PSA.57.3	God will send his loyal love and his faithfulness. 
PSA.57.4	My soul is among lions. 
PSA.57.4	I lie down among those who devour— 
PSA.57.4	the children
PSA.57.4	and whose tongues are sharp swords. 
PSA.57.5	Be exalted above the heavens, O God. 
PSA.57.5	Let your glory be above all the earth. 
PSA.57.6	They have set a net for my steps; 
PSA.57.6	my soul is bowed down. 
PSA.57.6	They have dug a pit before me; 
PSA.57.6	they have fallen into the midst of it. 
PSA.57.7	My heart is steadfast, O God; 
PSA.57.7	My heart is steadfast. 
PSA.57.7	I will sing and give praise. 
PSA.57.8	Awake, my glory; 
PSA.57.8	Awake, harp and lyre. 
PSA.57.8	I will awake the dawn.
PSA.57.9	I will give you thanks among the peoples, O Lord; 
PSA.57.9	I will give you praise among the nations. 
PSA.57.10	Because your loyal love is high to the heavens, 
PSA.57.10	and your faithfulness to the clouds. 
PSA.57.11	Be exalted above the heavens, O God. 
PSA.57.11	Let your glory be above all the earth. 
PSA.58.1	Do you really speak what is right when silent?
PSA.58.1	Do you judge fairly the children of humankind?
PSA.58.2	No, in your heart you plan injustices; 
PSA.58.2	in the land
PSA.58.3	The wicked are estranged from the womb. 
PSA.58.3	They go astray from the belly, speaking lies. 
PSA.58.4	Their venom is like snake venom; 
PSA.58.4	They are like a deaf viper that closes its ear 
PSA.58.5	so that it does not hear the voice of charmers 
PSA.58.5	or the skilled caster of spells. 
PSA.58.6	O God, break their teeth in their mouth. 
PSA.58.6	Break off the fangs of the young lions, O Yahweh. 
PSA.58.7	Let them run away like water that runs off. 
PSA.58.7	When he bends the bow, let his arrows be as though they were cut off.
PSA.58.8	Let them be like a snail that melts away as it goes; 
PSA.58.8	like the stillborn of woman that do not see the sun. 
PSA.58.9	Before your pots can feel the heat of a thornbush, 
PSA.58.9	whether green or dry,
PSA.58.10	The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; 
PSA.58.10	he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 
PSA.58.11	And people
PSA.58.11	Surely there is a God who judges in the land.”
PSA.59.1	Deliver me from my enemies, O my God. 
PSA.59.1	Protect
PSA.59.2	Deliver me from workers of iniquity, 
PSA.59.2	and from men of bloodshed save me. 
PSA.59.3	For look, they lie in wait for my life.
PSA.59.3	The mighty attack
PSA.59.3	not because of my transgression or my sin, O Yahweh. 
PSA.59.4	Without guilt on my part they run and ready themselves. 
PSA.59.4	Awake to meet me and see. 
PSA.59.5	And you, Yahweh, God of hosts, are the God of Israel. 
PSA.59.5	Rouse yourself to punish all the nations. 
PSA.59.5	Do not be gracious to any who treacherously plot evil. 
PSA.59.6	They return at evening; they howl like dogs
PSA.59.6	while they prowl the city. 
PSA.59.7	Look, they pour out talk with their mouth. 
PSA.59.7	Swords are on their lips, 
PSA.59.7	for they say, “Who hears?” 
PSA.59.8	But you, O Yahweh, will laugh at them; 
PSA.59.8	you will mock all the nations. 
PSA.59.9	O my strength,
PSA.59.9	because you, O God, are my (high) stronghold. 
PSA.59.10	My
PSA.59.10	God will cause me to look in triumph on my enemies. 
PSA.59.11	Do not kill them, lest my people forget. 
PSA.59.11	Make them to wander by your power, 
PSA.59.11	and bring them down, O Lord, our shield. 
PSA.59.12	By the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips, 
PSA.59.12	even in their pride, let them be trapped, 
PSA.59.12	and for the curses
PSA.59.13	Destroy in anger; destroy so they are no more, 
PSA.59.13	so that they may know that God is ruling in Jacob 
PSA.59.13	to the ends of the earth. 
PSA.59.14	They return at evening; they howl like dogs
PSA.59.14	while they prowl the city. 
PSA.59.15	As for them, they wander for food. 
PSA.59.15	If they are not satisfied, then they continue all night.
PSA.59.16	But as for me, I will sing of your strength, 
PSA.59.16	and I will hail your loyal love in the morning, 
PSA.59.16	because you have been my high stronghold 
PSA.59.16	and a refuge in my time
PSA.59.17	O my strength, to you I will give praise, 
PSA.59.17	because God is my high stronghold, 
PSA.59.17	my God of loyal love. 
PSA.60.1	O God, you have rejected us. You have broken us. 
PSA.60.1	You have been angry. Restore us! 
PSA.60.2	You have made the land quake. You have split it open. 
PSA.60.2	Heal its fissures, because it totters. 
PSA.60.3	You have shown your people hard things; 
PSA.60.3	You have given us wine that staggers. 
PSA.60.4	You have rallied those who fear you round a banner 
PSA.60.4	out of bowshot,
PSA.60.5	so that your beloved ones may be rescued. 
PSA.60.5	Save by your right hand and answer us. 
PSA.60.6	God has spoken in his holiness, 
PSA.60.6	“I will rejoice; 
PSA.60.6	I will divide up Shechem, 
PSA.60.6	and portion out the valley of Succoth. 
PSA.60.7	Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine, 
PSA.60.7	and Ephraim is the helmet for
PSA.60.7	Judah is my scepter.
PSA.60.8	Moab is my washing pot; 
PSA.60.8	over Edom, I will cast my sandal. 
PSA.60.8	On account of me, O Philistia, raise a shout.” 
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me to the fortified city? 
PSA.60.9	Who will lead me to Edom? 
PSA.60.10	Have not you yourself rejected us, O God, 
PSA.60.10	and not gone out with our armies, O God? 
PSA.60.11	Give us help against the adversary, 
PSA.60.11	for the help of humankind is futile. 
PSA.60.12	Through God we will do valiantly,
PSA.60.12	and it is he who will tread down our enemies. 
PSA.61.1	Hear, O God, my cry; 
PSA.61.1	attend to my prayer. 
PSA.61.2	From the end of the earth
PSA.61.2	when my heart grows faint. 
PSA.61.2	You will lead me to a rock that is higher than I. 
PSA.61.3	For you have been my refuge, 
PSA.61.3	a strong tower from the enemy. 
PSA.61.4	Let me reside in your tent forever. 
PSA.61.4	Let me take refuge under the covering of your wings. 
PSA.61.5	For you, O God, you have heard my vows. 
PSA.61.5	You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name. 
PSA.61.6	You will add days to the days of the king, 
PSA.61.6	his years like those of many generations.
PSA.61.7	May he live
PSA.61.7	Appoint loyal love and faithfulness to preserve him. 
PSA.61.8	So I will sing the praise of your name forever, 
PSA.61.8	that I may fulfill
PSA.62.1	Only for God my soul waits in silence. 
PSA.62.1	From him is my salvation. 
PSA.62.2	Only he is my rock and my salvation, 
PSA.62.2	my high stronghold; I shall not be greatly shaken. 
PSA.62.3	How long will you attack a man? 
PSA.62.3	All of you will be shattered
PSA.62.3	like a leaning wall, a tottering fence. 
PSA.62.4	They only
PSA.62.4	they are pleased with deception. 
PSA.62.4	With their mouths
PSA.62.4	but inwardly
PSA.62.5	Only for God wait in silence, O my soul, 
PSA.62.5	because my hope is from him. 
PSA.62.6	Only he is my rock and my salvation, 
PSA.62.6	my high stronghold; I shall not be shaken. 
PSA.62.7	On God rests my salvation and my glory; 
PSA.62.7	God
PSA.62.8	Trust him at all times, O people; 
PSA.62.8	pour out before him your heart. 
PSA.62.8	God is a refuge for us. 
PSA.62.9	Only a vapor
PSA.62.9	a deception are men of high degree. 
PSA.62.9	Weighed
PSA.62.9	together they are lighter than a vapor. 
PSA.62.10	Do not trust in extortion, 
PSA.62.10	and do not put vain confidence in robbery. 
PSA.62.10	If wealth increases, 
PSA.62.10	do not set your heart on it. 
PSA.62.11	Once God has spoken; 
PSA.62.11	twice I have heard this: 
PSA.62.11	that strength belongs to God. 
PSA.62.12	And to you belongs loyal love, O Lord, 
PSA.62.12	because you will render to each according to his work. 
PSA.63.1	O God, you are my God; 
PSA.63.1	I will seek you diligently. 
PSA.63.1	My soul thirsts for you; my flesh longs for you 
PSA.63.1	as in a dry and weary land without water. 
PSA.63.2	Thus I have seen you in the sanctuary, 
PSA.63.2	beholding your strength and glory. 
PSA.63.3	Because your loyal love is better than life, 
PSA.63.3	my lips will praise you. 
PSA.63.4	So I will bless you while I live. 
PSA.63.4	I will lift up my hands
PSA.63.5	My soul will be satisfied as with the best and richest food, 
PSA.63.5	and with joyful lips my mouth will praise. 
PSA.63.6	When I remember you on my bed, 
PSA.63.6	I meditate on you in the night watches. 
PSA.63.7	Because you have been my help, 
PSA.63.7	therefore
PSA.63.8	My soul clings to
PSA.63.8	your right hand upholds me. 
PSA.63.9	But as for them who seek my life for ruin, 
PSA.63.9	they will go into the depths of the earth. 
PSA.63.10	They who would deliver him to the sword
PSA.63.10	will become a portion for jackals. 
PSA.63.11	However, the king will rejoice in God. 
PSA.63.11	Everyone who swears an oath by him will boast, 
PSA.63.11	because the mouth of the liars will be stopped. 
PSA.64.1	Hear my voice, O God, in my lamenting. 
PSA.64.1	Preserve my life from the fear of the enemy. 
PSA.64.2	Hide me from the secret plots
PSA.64.2	from the unrest of those who do iniquity, 
PSA.64.3	who sharpen their tongue like a sword. 
PSA.64.3	They bend their bow to shoot their arrows—bitter words, 
PSA.64.4	to shoot from
PSA.64.4	Suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear. 
PSA.64.5	They encourage themselves in the evil matter. 
PSA.64.5	They talk of secretly laying snares. 
PSA.64.5	They say, “Who will see them?” 
PSA.64.6	They carefully plot
PSA.64.6	“We have perfected the perfect plot!”
PSA.64.6	Both the inner thought
PSA.64.7	But God will shoot them; 
PSA.64.7	with an arrow they will suddenly be wounded. 
PSA.64.8	 And they who would cause him
PSA.64.8	their own tongue will be against them. 
PSA.64.8	All who gaze on them will shake.
PSA.64.9	And then
PSA.64.9	and will declare the working of God, 
PSA.64.9	and will understand his doing. 
PSA.64.10	The righteous will rejoice in Yahweh and take refuge in him, 
PSA.64.10	and all the upright in heart will boast. 
PSA.65.1	Praise awaits you, O God, in Zion, 
PSA.65.1	and to you the vow shall be fulfilled. 
PSA.65.2	O you who hear prayer, 
PSA.65.2	to you all flesh will come. 
PSA.65.3	Iniquities
PSA.65.3	As for our transgressions, you will forgive
PSA.65.4	Blessed is one whom you choose and bring near, 
PSA.65.4	that he may abide in your courts. 
PSA.65.4	We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house, 
PSA.65.4	your holy temple. 
PSA.65.5	By awesome deeds in righteousness you will answer us, 
PSA.65.5	O God of our salvation, 
PSA.65.5	you who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth 
PSA.65.5	and of the far-off seas, 
PSA.65.6	who established the mountains by his strength, 
PSA.65.6	the one who is girded with might, 
PSA.65.7	who stills the roar of the seas, 
PSA.65.7	the roar of their waves, 
PSA.65.7	and the commotion of the peoples, 
PSA.65.8	so that
PSA.65.8	You make the dawn and sunset sing for joy. 
PSA.65.9	You care for
PSA.65.9	you greatly enrich it. 
PSA.65.9	The stream of God is filled with waters. 
PSA.65.9	You provide their grain, 
PSA.65.9	for so you have established it. 
PSA.65.10	You drench its furrows, 
PSA.65.10	penetrating its ridges. 
PSA.65.10	With rains you soften it; 
PSA.65.10	its growth you bless. 
PSA.65.11	You crown the year with your bounty,
PSA.65.11	and your wagon paths drip with richness.
PSA.65.12	They drop on the pastures of the wilderness, 
PSA.65.12	and the hills gird themselves with joy. 
PSA.65.13	The pasturelands put on flocks, 
PSA.65.13	and the valleys clothe themselves with grain. 
PSA.65.13	They shout in triumph; 
PSA.65.13	they even sing. 
PSA.66.1	Shout joyfully to God, all the earth. 
PSA.66.2	Sing the glory of his name. 
PSA.66.2	Set forth his glorious praise.
PSA.66.3	Say to God, “How awesome are your works! 
PSA.66.3	Because of the greatness of your strength, 
PSA.66.3	your enemies will cringe before you. 
PSA.66.4	All the earth will bow in worship to you, 
PSA.66.4	and sing praise to you. 
PSA.66.4	They will sing the praise of your name.” 
PSA.66.5	Come and consider
PSA.66.5	he is awesome in his dealings
PSA.66.6	He turned the sea into dry ground; 
PSA.66.6	they passed through the river on foot. 
PSA.66.6	There we rejoiced in him. 
PSA.66.7	He rules by his might forever; 
PSA.66.7	his eyes keep watch on the nations. 
PSA.66.7	Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves.
PSA.66.8	Bless our God, O peoples, 
PSA.66.8	and cause the sound of his praise to be heard, 
PSA.66.9	the one who has kept our soul among the living, 
PSA.66.9	and has not allowed our foot to slip. 
PSA.66.10	For you have tested us, O God; 
PSA.66.10	you have tried us as silver is tried. 
PSA.66.11	You brought us into the net; 
PSA.66.11	you placed a heavy burden
PSA.66.12	You let men
PSA.66.12	We went through fire and through water, 
PSA.66.12	but you have brought us out to the place of abundance.
PSA.66.13	I will come into your house
PSA.66.13	I will pay to you my vows 
PSA.66.14	that my lips uttered, 
PSA.66.14	and my mouth spoke in my distress. 
PSA.66.15	Burnt offerings of fat animals I will offer to you, 
PSA.66.15	with the smoke of rams. 
PSA.66.15	I will do
PSA.66.16	Come and hear, all you God-fearers, and I will tell 
PSA.66.16	what he has done for me.
PSA.66.17	I called to him with my mouth, 
PSA.66.17	and he was extolled with my tongue.
PSA.66.18	If I had considered evil in my heart, 
PSA.66.18	the Lord would not have listened. 
PSA.66.19	However, God has listened; 
PSA.66.19	he has attended to the sound of my prayer. 
PSA.66.20	Blessed be God, 
PSA.66.20	who has not turned aside my prayer, 
PSA.66.20	or his loyal love from me. 
PSA.67.1	May God be gracious to us and bless us. 
PSA.67.1	May he cause his face to shine toward us, 
PSA.67.2	that your way may be known on the earth, 
PSA.67.2	your salvation among all nations. 
PSA.67.3	Let the peoples praise you, O God; 
PSA.67.3	let all of the peoples praise you. 
PSA.67.4	Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, 
PSA.67.4	because you judge the peoples with equity 
PSA.67.4	and guide the nations on the earth. 
PSA.67.5	Let the peoples praise you, O God; 
PSA.67.5	let all the peoples praise you. 
PSA.67.6	The earth has yielded its produce. 
PSA.67.6	God, our God, will bless us. 
PSA.67.7	God will bless us, 
PSA.67.7	and all the ends of the earth will fear him. 
PSA.68.1	God will arise; his enemies will be scattered, 
PSA.68.1	and those who hate him will flee from before him. 
PSA.68.2	As smoke is driven off, you will drive them off. 
PSA.68.2	As wax melts before fire, 
PSA.68.2	the wicked will perish before God. 
PSA.68.3	But the righteous will be glad; they will exalt before God, 
PSA.68.3	and will rejoice with joy. 
PSA.68.4	Sing to God, sing praises to his name. 
PSA.68.4	Lift up a song to the rider on the clouds—his name is Yah—
PSA.68.4	and rejoice before him. 
PSA.68.5	A father to orphans and a judge for widows 
PSA.68.5	is God in his holy habitation. 
PSA.68.6	God settles the lonely in a home; 
PSA.68.6	he brings prisoners out into prosperity. 
PSA.68.6	But the rebellious abide in a barren land. 
PSA.68.7	O God, when you went out before your people, 
PSA.68.7	when you marched through the desert, 
PSA.68.8	the earth shook; the heavens also dripped rain 
PSA.68.8	at the presence of God who was at Sinai, 
PSA.68.8	at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 
PSA.68.9	You caused abundant rain to fall, O God. 
PSA.68.9	When your inheritance was weary you revived it. 
PSA.68.10	Your community dwelled in it. 
PSA.68.10	You provided in your goodness for the poor, O God. 
PSA.68.11	The Lord gives the word. 
PSA.68.11	Great is the company of women who announce: 
PSA.68.12	“The kings of armies flee, they flee, 
PSA.68.12	and she who remains at home divides the spoil. 
PSA.68.13	Though you men lie down between the sheepfolds, 
PSA.68.13	you will be like the wings of a dove covered in silver 
PSA.68.13	and its pinions in yellow gold.” 
PSA.68.14	When Shaddai scattered kings on it, 
PSA.68.14	on Zalmon it snowed.
PSA.68.15	A mountain of God
PSA.68.15	a mountain of many peaks is the mountain of Bashan. 
PSA.68.16	Why do you look with hostility, O many-peaked mountains? 
PSA.68.16	This
PSA.68.16	Yes, Yahweh will abide in it forever. 
PSA.68.17	The chariots of God 
PSA.68.17	are twice ten thousand, with thousands doubled. 
PSA.68.17	The Lord is among them at Sinai, distinctive in victory.
PSA.68.18	You have ascended on high; you have led away captives. 
PSA.68.18	You have received gifts from among humankind, 
PSA.68.18	and even from the rebellious, so that Yah
PSA.68.19	Blessed be the Lord. Daily he loads us with benefits,
PSA.68.19	the God of our salvation.
PSA.68.20	Our God is a God of deliverances, 
PSA.68.20	and to the Yahweh the Lord belong escapes from death. 
PSA.68.21	But God will shatter the head of his enemies, 
PSA.68.21	the hairy scalp of the one who continues on
PSA.68.22	The Lord said, “I will bring them back from Bashan; 
PSA.68.22	I will bring them back from the depths of the sea, 
PSA.68.23	so that your foot may shatter them bloody 
PSA.68.23	for the tongues of your dogs to have their share from the enemies.” 
PSA.68.24	They have seen your processions, O God, 
PSA.68.24	the processions of my God, my king, distinctive in victory.
PSA.68.25	Singers went up front, those playing stringed instruments last, 
PSA.68.25	between them young women playing tambourines. 
PSA.68.26	Bless God in the assemblies, 
PSA.68.26	Yahweh from the fountain of Israel. 
PSA.68.27	There is little Benjamin ruling them, 
PSA.68.27	with the princes of Judah in their throng, 
PSA.68.27	the princes of Zebulun and the princes of Naphtali. 
PSA.68.28	Your God has commanded your strength. 
PSA.68.28	Show yourself strong, O God, by what you perform
PSA.68.29	Because your temple is above Jerusalem, 
PSA.68.29	kings will bring tribute to you. 
PSA.68.30	Rebuke the beasts in
PSA.68.30	the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples, 
PSA.68.30	trampling the pieces of silver.
PSA.68.30	Scatter the nations who delight in battles. 
PSA.68.31	Ambassadors
PSA.68.31	Cush will quickly stretch out her hands to God. 
PSA.68.32	O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God; 
PSA.68.32	sing praise to the Lord, 
PSA.68.33	to the one who rides in the highest heavens of old. 
PSA.68.33	See, he gives forth his voice, a mighty voice. 
PSA.68.34	Ascribe strength to God. 
PSA.68.34	His majesty is over Israel, 
PSA.68.34	and his strength is in the clouds. 
PSA.68.35	Awesome are you, O God, from your sanctuary.
PSA.68.35	The God of Israel, it is he who gives strength and might to the people. 
PSA.68.35	Blessed be God. 
PSA.69.1	Save me, O God, 
PSA.69.1	because waters have come up to my neck.
PSA.69.2	I sink in the mud of the deep, and there is no foothold. 
PSA.69.2	I have come to watery depths, 
PSA.69.2	and the torrent floods over me. 
PSA.69.3	I am weary with my calling out; my throat is parched. 
PSA.69.3	My eyes are exhausted in my waiting for my God. 
PSA.69.4	More numerous than the hairs of my head 
PSA.69.4	are those hating me without a cause. 
PSA.69.4	Those who are destroying me—my enemies wrongfully
PSA.69.4	What I did not steal, I then must restore. 
PSA.69.5	O God, you yourself know
PSA.69.5	and my guilty deeds are not hidden from you. 
PSA.69.6	Let those who wait for you not be put to shame because of me, 
PSA.69.6	O Lord Yahweh of hosts. 
PSA.69.6	Let those who seek you not be disgraced because of me, 
PSA.69.6	O God of Israel. 
PSA.69.7	Because on account of you I have borne reproach; 
PSA.69.7	disgrace has covered my face. 
PSA.69.8	I have become a stranger to my brothers 
PSA.69.8	and a foreigner to my mother’s sons, 
PSA.69.9	because the zeal for your house
PSA.69.9	and the reproaches of those reproaching you have fallen on me. 
PSA.69.10	When I wept in the fasting of my soul, 
PSA.69.10	it became reproaches for me. 
PSA.69.11	When I made sackcloth my clothing, 
PSA.69.11	I became for them a byword. 
PSA.69.12	Those sitting at the gate talk about me 
PSA.69.12	as also
PSA.69.13	But as for me, my prayer is to you, O Yahweh, for a favorable time, 
PSA.69.13	O God, according to the abundance of your loyal love. 
PSA.69.13	Answer me with the faithfulness of your salvation. 
PSA.69.14	Deliver me from the mud and do not let me sink. 
PSA.69.14	Let me be delivered from those who hate me 
PSA.69.14	and from the watery depths. 
PSA.69.15	Do not let the torrent of waters flood over me, 
PSA.69.15	or the deep swallow me, 
PSA.69.15	or the pit close its mouth over me. 
PSA.69.16	Answer me, O Yahweh, because your loyal love is good; 
PSA.69.16	according to your abundant mercies, turn to me, 
PSA.69.17	and do not hide your face from your servant. 
PSA.69.17	Because I am in trouble, answer me quickly. 
PSA.69.18	Draw near to my soul; redeem it. 
PSA.69.18	Because of my enemies, ransom me. 
PSA.69.19	You know my reproach, my shame and my disgrace. 
PSA.69.19	Fully known
PSA.69.20	Reproach has broken my heart and I am sick. 
PSA.69.20	And I hoped for sympathy, but there was none, 
PSA.69.20	and for comforters, but I found none. 
PSA.69.21	They also gave me gall for food,
PSA.69.21	and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. 
PSA.69.22	Let their table before them be a trap, 
PSA.69.22	and their times of peace a snare. 
PSA.69.23	Let their eyes be dark so they cannot see, 
PSA.69.23	and make their loins continually tremble. 
PSA.69.24	Pour out your indignation on them, 
PSA.69.24	and let your burning anger overtake them. 
PSA.69.25	Let their camp be desolate. 
PSA.69.25	Let none dwell in their tents, 
PSA.69.26	because they persecute those whom you, yourself, have struck, 
PSA.69.26	and they tell of the pain of those you have wounded. 
PSA.69.27	Add guilt on top of their guilt,
PSA.69.27	and do not let them be acquitted.
PSA.69.28	Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, 
PSA.69.28	and let them not be recorded with the righteous. 
PSA.69.29	But as for me, though I am afflicted and pained, 
PSA.69.29	your salvation will protect
PSA.69.30	I will praise the name of God in song, 
PSA.69.30	and magnify him with thanksgiving. 
PSA.69.31	For Yahweh it will be better than an ox or bull, 
PSA.69.31	horned and hoofed.
PSA.69.32	The afflicted will see and rejoice. 
PSA.69.32	O God seekers, let your heart revive,
PSA.69.33	because Yahweh hears the needy 
PSA.69.33	and does not despise his own who are prisoners. 
PSA.69.34	Let heavens and earth praise him, 
PSA.69.34	the seas and all that moves in them, 
PSA.69.35	because God will save Zion 
PSA.69.35	and build the cities of Judah, 
PSA.69.35	that they may dwell there and possess it. 
PSA.69.36	And the offspring of his servants will inherit it, 
PSA.69.36	and those who love his name will abide in it. 
PSA.70.1	O God, make haste to deliver me. 
PSA.70.1	O Yahweh, make haste to help me. 
PSA.70.2	Let them be ashamed and abashed 
PSA.70.2	who seek my life. 
PSA.70.2	Let them be repulsed and humiliated 
PSA.70.2	who desire my harm. 
PSA.70.3	let them turn back because of their shame, 
PSA.70.3	those who say, “Aha! Aha!” 
PSA.70.4	Let them rejoice and be glad in you, 
PSA.70.4	all those who seek you. 
PSA.70.4	Let them say continually, “God is great!” 
PSA.70.4	those who love your salvation. 
PSA.70.5	But I am poor and needy; 
PSA.70.5	O God hasten to me. 
PSA.70.5	You are my help and my deliverer. 
PSA.70.5	O Yahweh, do not delay. 
PSA.71.1	In you, O Yahweh, I have taken refuge; 
PSA.71.1	let me never be put to shame. 
PSA.71.2	In your righteousness deliver me and rescue me; 
PSA.71.2	incline your ear to me and save me. 
PSA.71.3	Be for me a rock of refuge to resort to always; 
PSA.71.3	you have ordained
PSA.71.3	because you are my rock and my fortress. 
PSA.71.4	My God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked, 
PSA.71.4	from the grasp
PSA.71.5	because you are my hope, 
PSA.71.5	O Lord Yahweh, my confidence from my youth. 
PSA.71.6	Upon you I have leaned from birth.
PSA.71.6	It was you who took
PSA.71.6	My praise is of you continually. 
PSA.71.7	I have become a wonder to many, 
PSA.71.7	but you are my strong refuge. 
PSA.71.8	My mouth is filled with your praise, 
PSA.71.8	with your glory all the day. 
PSA.71.9	Do not cast me away in the time of old age; 
PSA.71.9	when my strength fails do not abandon me. 
PSA.71.10	For my enemies talk concerning me, 
PSA.71.10	and those who watch for my life conspire together, 
PSA.71.11	saying, “His God has abandoned him. 
PSA.71.11	Pursue and seize him, because there is no deliverer.” 
PSA.71.12	O God, do not be far from me. 
PSA.71.12	My God, hurry to help me. 
PSA.71.13	Let them be ashamed; let them perish 
PSA.71.13	who are my adversaries.
PSA.71.13	Let them wrap themselves with scorn and disgrace 
PSA.71.13	who seek my harm. 
PSA.71.14	But as for me, I will hope continually 
PSA.71.14	and increase your praise. 
PSA.71.15	My mouth will tell of your righteousness, 
PSA.71.15	your salvation all day long,
PSA.71.15	though I do not know the full sum of them. 
PSA.71.16	I will come in to tell the mighty deeds of Lord Yahweh. 
PSA.71.16	I will make known
PSA.71.17	O God, you have taught me from my youth, 
PSA.71.17	and up to now I have proclaimed your wonderful deeds. 
PSA.71.18	And even when I am old and gray, 
PSA.71.18	O God, do not abandon me 
PSA.71.18	until I proclaim your strength
PSA.71.18	your power to every one that comes after. 
PSA.71.19	And your righteousness, O God, is to the height of heaven. 
PSA.71.19	You who have done great things, 
PSA.71.19	O God, who is like you? 
PSA.71.20	You who have caused me
PSA.71.20	you will again revive me.
PSA.71.20	And from the depths of the earth 
PSA.71.20	you will again bring me up. 
PSA.71.21	You will increase my greatness, 
PSA.71.21	and you will comfort me all around.
PSA.71.22	On my part, I will praise you with a stringed instrument, 
PSA.71.22	and your faithfulness, O my God. 
PSA.71.22	I will sing praises to you with a lyre, 
PSA.71.22	O Holy One of Israel. 
PSA.71.23	My lips will sing for joy when I sing praises to you, 
PSA.71.23	and my soul, which you have redeemed. 
PSA.71.24	My tongue also 
PSA.71.24	will speak of your righteousness all the day, 
PSA.71.24	because they have been put to shame, because they have been humiliated 
PSA.71.24	who seek my harm. 
PSA.72.1	O God, give your judgments to the king, 
PSA.72.1	and your righteousness to the king’s son. 
PSA.72.2	May he judge your people with righteousness, 
PSA.72.2	and your poor with justice. 
PSA.72.3	Let the mountains yield prosperity
PSA.72.3	and the hills in righteousness. 
PSA.72.4	May he provide justice for the poor of the people, 
PSA.72.4	save the children of the needy, 
PSA.72.4	and crush the oppressor. 
PSA.72.5	May he live long
PSA.72.5	as long as the moon
PSA.72.6	May he descend like rain on mown grass, 
PSA.72.6	like showers watering the earth. 
PSA.72.7	May what is right blossom in his days 
PSA.72.7	and an abundance of peace, until the moon is no more. 
PSA.72.8	And may he rule from sea up to sea, 
PSA.72.8	and from the River
PSA.72.9	Let the desert dwellers bow down before him, 
PSA.72.9	and his enemies lick the dust. 
PSA.72.10	Let the kings of Tarshish and the islands bring tribute. 
PSA.72.10	Let the kings of Sheba and Seba present gifts, 
PSA.72.11	and let all kings bow down to him. 
PSA.72.11	Let all nations serve him. 
PSA.72.12	Indeed he will deliver the needy who is crying for help, 
PSA.72.12	and the afflicted who has no helper. 
PSA.72.13	He will take pity on the helpless and needy, 
PSA.72.13	and the lives of the needy he will save. 
PSA.72.14	From oppression and from violence 
PSA.72.14	he will redeem their lives, 
PSA.72.14	and their blood will be precious in his eyes. 
PSA.72.15	So may he live, and may gold from Sheba be given to him, 
PSA.72.15	and may prayers be offered for him continually. 
PSA.72.15	May blessings be invoked for him all day long.
PSA.72.16	May there be an abundance of grain in the land 
PSA.72.16	even on the top of the mountains. 
PSA.72.16	May his crop
PSA.72.16	and may those from the city blossom like the grass of the earth. 
PSA.72.17	May his name endure forever. 
PSA.72.17	May his name increase as long as the sun shines,
PSA.72.17	and let them be blessed in him. 
PSA.72.17	Let all nations call him blessed. 
PSA.72.18	Blessed be Yahweh God, the God of Israel, 
PSA.72.18	who alone does wonderful things. 
PSA.72.19	And blessed be his glorious name forever, 
PSA.72.19	and may the whole earth be filled with his glory. 
PSA.72.19	Amen and Amen. 
PSA.72.20	The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are completed. 
PSA.73.1	Surely God is good to Israel, 
PSA.73.1	to those pure of heart. 
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled. 
PSA.73.2	My steps had nearly slipped, 
PSA.73.3	because I envied the boastful 
PSA.73.3	when I saw the well-being
PSA.73.4	For there are no pains up to their death, 
PSA.73.4	and their bodies are healthy.
PSA.73.5	They do not have ordinary trouble,
PSA.73.5	and they are not plagued as other people.
PSA.73.6	Therefore pride is their necklace; 
PSA.73.6	an outfit of violence covers them. 
PSA.73.7	Their eye bulges from fat.
PSA.73.7	Imaginings overflow their heart. 
PSA.73.8	They mock and speak maliciously of oppression; 
PSA.73.8	they speak as though from on high. 
PSA.73.9	They set their mouth against the heavens, 
PSA.73.9	and their tongue roams the earth. 
PSA.73.10	Therefore his people turn there,
PSA.73.10	and abundant waters are slurped up by them. 
PSA.73.11	And they say, “How does God know?” 
PSA.73.11	and, “Does the Most High have knowledge?” 
PSA.73.12	See, these are the wicked, 
PSA.73.12	and they increase wealth, ever carefree. 
PSA.73.13	Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure, 
PSA.73.13	and washed my hands in innocence. 
PSA.73.14	And I have been plagued all day 
PSA.73.14	and rebuked every morning.
PSA.73.15	If I had said, “I will speak thus,” 
PSA.73.15	behold, I would have acted treacherously 
PSA.73.15	against your children’s generation. 
PSA.73.16	When I thought about how to understand this, 
PSA.73.16	it was troubling in my eyes 
PSA.73.17	until I went into the sanctuary of God. 
PSA.73.17	Then I understood their fate. 
PSA.73.18	Surely you set them on slippery places. 
PSA.73.18	You cause them to fall onto ruin.
PSA.73.19	How they become a desolation in a moment! 
PSA.73.19	They come to a complete end by terrors. 
PSA.73.20	Like a dream upon awakening, 
PSA.73.20	when you wake up, O Lord, 
PSA.73.20	you will despise their fleeting form.
PSA.73.21	When my heart was embittered 
PSA.73.21	and I felt stabbed in my kidneys, 
PSA.73.22	then I was brutish and ignorant. 
PSA.73.22	With you I was like the beasts. 
PSA.73.23	But I am continually with you; 
PSA.73.23	you have hold of my right hand. 
PSA.73.24	You will guide me with your advice, 
PSA.73.24	and afterward you will take me into honor.
PSA.73.25	Whom do I have in the heavens except you? 
PSA.73.25	And with you I have no other desire on earth. 
PSA.73.26	My flesh and heart failed, 
PSA.73.26	but God is the strength
PSA.73.27	For indeed, those distancing themselves from you will be ruined. 
PSA.73.27	You destroy each who abandons you for harlotry. 
PSA.73.28	But as for me, the approach to God is for my good. 
PSA.73.28	I have set the Lord Yahweh as my refuge, 
PSA.73.28	in order to tell all your works. 
PSA.74.1	Why, O God, have you rejected us forever? 
PSA.74.1	Why does your anger smoke 
PSA.74.1	against the sheep of your pasture? 
PSA.74.2	Remember your congregation that you bought long ago, 
PSA.74.2	when you redeemed the tribe of your inheritance. 
PSA.74.2	Remember Mount Zion
PSA.74.3	Lift your steps to the perpetual ruins, 
PSA.74.3	to all that the enemy has ruined in the sanctuary. 
PSA.74.4	Your enemies have roared in the midst of your meeting place; 
PSA.74.4	they have set up their signs for signs. 
PSA.74.5	They are
PSA.74.5	axes in a thicket of trees. 
PSA.74.6	And now
PSA.74.6	they have smashed with axe and hammer. 
PSA.74.7	They have set fire to your sanctuary. 
PSA.74.7	They have defiled to the ground, 
PSA.74.7	the dwelling place for your name. 
PSA.74.8	They have said in their heart, 
PSA.74.8	“We will completely
PSA.74.8	They burned all the meeting places of God in the land. 
PSA.74.9	We do not see our signs, 
PSA.74.9	and there is no longer a prophet. 
PSA.74.9	No one with us knows how long. 
PSA.74.10	How long, O God, will the adversary taunt? 
PSA.74.10	Will the enemy treat your name with contempt forever? 
PSA.74.11	Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand? 
PSA.74.11	Take it from your bosom;
PSA.74.12	But God has been my king from long ago, 
PSA.74.12	working salvation in the midst of the earth. 
PSA.74.13	You split open the sea by your strength; 
PSA.74.13	You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters. 
PSA.74.14	You crushed the heads of Leviathan; 
PSA.74.14	you gave him as food to the desert dwelling creatures. 
PSA.74.15	You split open spring and wadi.
PSA.74.15	You dried up ever-flowing rivers. 
PSA.74.16	Yours is the day, yours is the night also. 
PSA.74.16	You established light and the sun. 
PSA.74.17	You defined
PSA.74.17	Summer and winter—you formed them. 
PSA.74.18	O Yahweh, remember this: the enemy taunts, 
PSA.74.18	and foolish people treat your name with contempt. 
PSA.74.19	Do not give to beasts the life of your dove; 
PSA.74.19	do not ever forget the life of your afflicted ones. 
PSA.74.20	Have regard for the covenant, 
PSA.74.20	because the dark places of the land are full of 
PSA.74.20	the haunts of violence. 
PSA.74.21	Do not let the oppressed turn back humiliated; 
PSA.74.21	let the poor and needy praise your name. 
PSA.74.22	Rise up, O God, plead your cause; 
PSA.74.22	remember the reproaching of you by the foolish all day long.
PSA.74.23	Do not forget the sound of your adversaries, 
PSA.74.23	the roar of those rising up against you ascending continually. 
PSA.75.1	We give thanks to you, O God; 
PSA.75.1	we give thanks, and your name is near. 
PSA.75.1	Your wonderful deeds are told.
PSA.75.2	“I will indeed set an appointed time; 
PSA.75.2	I will judge fairly.
PSA.75.3	The earth and all its inhabitants are shaking;
PSA.75.3	I steady
PSA.75.4	I say to the boastful, ‘Do not boast!’ 
PSA.75.4	and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horn! 
PSA.75.5	Do not lift up high your
PSA.75.5	Do not speak with arrogant pride.’ ”
PSA.75.6	For it is not from the east or the west 
PSA.75.6	and not from the south
PSA.75.7	rather God is the judge; 
PSA.75.7	one he brings low, and another he lifts up. 
PSA.75.8	For there is a cup in the hand of Yahweh 
PSA.75.8	with
PSA.75.8	and he pours out from this. 
PSA.75.8	Surely all the wicked of the land 
PSA.75.8	will quaff it down to its dregs. 
PSA.75.9	But as for me, I will proclaim forever; 
PSA.75.9	I will sing praise to the God of Jacob. 
PSA.75.10	“And all the horns of the wicked I will cut off. 
PSA.75.10	The horns of the righteous will be lifted up.” 
PSA.76.1	God is known in Judah. 
PSA.76.1	His name is great in Israel. 
PSA.76.2	His den
PSA.76.2	his lair
PSA.76.3	There he broke the flames of the bow, 
PSA.76.3	the shield and sword and battle. 
PSA.76.4	Radiant
PSA.76.4	from
PSA.76.5	The stouthearted are plundered; 
PSA.76.5	they sleep their sleep, 
PSA.76.5	and all the able men cannot use
PSA.76.6	At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, 
PSA.76.6	both rider
PSA.76.7	You, indeed, are to be feared,
PSA.76.7	and who can stand before you 
PSA.76.7	when you are angry? 
PSA.76.8	From heaven you proclaimed judgment. 
PSA.76.8	The earth feared and was still 
PSA.76.9	when God rose for justice, 
PSA.76.9	to save all the afflicted of the land. 
PSA.76.10	For the anger of humankind will praise you. 
PSA.76.10	You will put on the remnant of anger.
PSA.76.11	Make vows and fulfill them to Yahweh, your God; 
PSA.76.11	let all surrounding him 
PSA.76.11	bring tribute to the one to be feared.
PSA.76.12	He cuts off the spirit of leaders. 
PSA.76.12	He is to be feared by the kings of the earth. 
PSA.77.1	I cry out with my voice to God; 
PSA.77.1	with my voice to God, that he may hear me. 
PSA.77.2	In the day I have trouble, I seek
PSA.77.2	At night my hand stretches out continually;
PSA.77.2	my soul refuses to be comforted. 
PSA.77.3	I remember God and I groan loudly; 
PSA.77.3	I meditate and my spirit grows faint. 
PSA.77.4	You hold open my eyelids. 
PSA.77.4	I am troubled and cannot speak. 
PSA.77.5	I think about the days from long ago, 
PSA.77.5	the years of ancient times. 
PSA.77.6	I remember my song in the night. 
PSA.77.6	With my heart I meditate, 
PSA.77.6	and my spirit searches to understand. 
PSA.77.7	Will the Lord reject us forever, 
PSA.77.7	and will he never be pleased with us again? 
PSA.77.8	Has his loyal love ceased forever? 
PSA.77.8	Is his promise
PSA.77.9	Has God forgotten to have compassion? 
PSA.77.9	Or has he closed off his mercies in anger? 
PSA.77.10	So I said, “This pierces me—
PSA.77.10	the right hand of the Most High has changed.” 
PSA.77.11	I will remember the deeds of Yah.
PSA.77.11	Surely I will remember your wonders
PSA.77.12	I will also muse on all your work, 
PSA.77.12	and meditate on your deeds. 
PSA.77.13	O God, your way is distinctive.
PSA.77.13	Who is a great god like our God? 
PSA.77.14	You are the God who works wonders;
PSA.77.14	you have made known your might among the peoples. 
PSA.77.15	With your arm you redeemed your people, 
PSA.77.15	the children of Jacob and Joseph. 
PSA.77.16	Waters saw you, O God; 
PSA.77.16	waters saw you and they trembled. 
PSA.77.16	Surely the deeps shook. 
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured out water. 
PSA.77.17	The skies thundered.
PSA.77.17	Your arrows also flew about.
PSA.77.18	The sound of your thunder was in the whirlwind;
PSA.77.18	lightnings lit the world; 
PSA.77.18	the earth shook and quaked. 
PSA.77.19	Your way was through the sea, 
PSA.77.19	and your path
PSA.77.19	Yet your footprints were not discerned.
PSA.77.20	You led your people like a flock 
PSA.77.20	by the hand of Moses and Aaron. 
PSA.78.1	Listen, O my people, to my teaching. 
PSA.78.1	Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 
PSA.78.2	I will offer
PSA.78.2	I will pour out riddles from long ago, 
PSA.78.3	that we have heard and known, 
PSA.78.3	and our ancestors
PSA.78.4	We will not hide them from their children,
PSA.78.4	telling the next generation the praises of Yahweh, 
PSA.78.4	and his power and his wonders that he has done. 
PSA.78.5	For he established a testimony in Jacob, 
PSA.78.5	and appointed a law
PSA.78.5	which he commanded our ancestors
PSA.78.5	to teach to their children, 
PSA.78.6	so that the next generation might know— 
PSA.78.6	children yet to be born— 
PSA.78.6	that they might rise up and tell their children, 
PSA.78.7	that they might set their confidence in God, 
PSA.78.7	and not forget the deeds of God, 
PSA.78.7	but keep his commandments, 
PSA.78.8	and not be like their ancestors,
PSA.78.8	a stubborn and rebellious generation, 
PSA.78.8	a generation that did not make ready its heart, 
PSA.78.8	whose spirit was not faithful to God. 
PSA.78.9	The sons of Ephraim, armed with archers,
PSA.78.9	turned back on the day of battle. 
PSA.78.10	They did not keep the covenant of God 
PSA.78.10	and refused to go in his law.
PSA.78.11	They also forgot his deeds, 
PSA.78.11	and his wonders that he had shown them. 
PSA.78.12	In front of their ancestors
PSA.78.12	in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan. 
PSA.78.13	He split the sea and caused them to go over, 
PSA.78.13	and he caused waters to stand like a heap. 
PSA.78.14	And he led them with the cloud by day, 
PSA.78.14	and all night with a fiery light. 
PSA.78.15	He caused rocks to split in the wilderness 
PSA.78.15	and provided drink abundantly as from the depths. 
PSA.78.16	And he brought streams out of the rock 
PSA.78.16	and caused water to flow down like rivers. 
PSA.78.17	But they sinned still further against him 
PSA.78.17	by rebelling against the Most High in the desert. 
PSA.78.18	And they tested God in their heart 
PSA.78.18	by asking food for their craving.
PSA.78.19	And they spoke against God. 
PSA.78.19	They said, “Is God able 
PSA.78.19	to prepare a table in the wilderness? 
PSA.78.20	Yes, he struck the rock and water flowed 
PSA.78.20	and streams gushed out, 
PSA.78.20	but can he also give food 
PSA.78.20	or provide meat for his people?” 
PSA.78.21	Therefore Yahweh heard 
PSA.78.21	and he was very angry, 
PSA.78.21	and a fire was kindled against Jacob, 
PSA.78.21	and his anger also rose up against Israel, 
PSA.78.22	because they did not believe God, 
PSA.78.22	and they did not trust his salvation. 
PSA.78.23	Nevertheless, he commanded the skies above 
PSA.78.23	and opened the doors of heaven, 
PSA.78.24	and rained down on them manna to eat 
PSA.78.24	and gave them the grain of heaven. 
PSA.78.25	Humankind ate the bread of angels.
PSA.78.25	He sent them food enough to be satisfied. 
PSA.78.26	He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens 
PSA.78.26	and drove along the south wind by his strength. 
PSA.78.27	Then he rained meat on them like dust, 
PSA.78.27	even winged birds
PSA.78.28	He caused them to fall in the midst of his camp, 
PSA.78.28	all around his dwellings. 
PSA.78.29	So they ate and were well filled, 
PSA.78.29	and he brought about what they craved. 
PSA.78.30	They had not yet turned aside from their craving, 
PSA.78.30	while their food was still in their mouth, 
PSA.78.31	the anger of God rose against them, 
PSA.78.31	and he killed some of the stoutest of them, 
PSA.78.31	even the young men of Israel he caused to bow down in death. 
PSA.78.32	In spite of all this they sinned further 
PSA.78.32	and did not believe his wonders. 
PSA.78.33	And he consumed their days with futility 
PSA.78.33	their years with terror.
PSA.78.34	When he killed some of them, then they sought him, 
PSA.78.34	and repented and earnestly sought God. 
PSA.78.35	And they remembered that God was their rock, 
PSA.78.35	and God Most High their redeemer. 
PSA.78.36	But they enticed him with their mouth 
PSA.78.36	and lied to him with their tongue. 
PSA.78.37	For their heart was not steadfast with him, 
PSA.78.37	nor were they faithful to his covenant. 
PSA.78.38	But he was compassionate; he pardoned
PSA.78.38	and did not destroy them. 
PSA.78.38	And many times he turned back his anger 
PSA.78.38	and did not stir up all his wrath, 
PSA.78.39	for he remembered that they were flesh, 
PSA.78.39	a passing wind that does not return. 
PSA.78.40	How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness 
PSA.78.40	and vexed him in the wasteland! 
PSA.78.41	So they again tested God 
PSA.78.41	and distressed
PSA.78.42	And they did not remember his power
PSA.78.42	when
PSA.78.43	how he performed
PSA.78.43	and his wonders in the region of Zoan, 
PSA.78.44	when he turned their rivers
PSA.78.44	so they could not drink from their streams. 
PSA.78.45	He sent among them flies that devoured them 
PSA.78.45	and frogs that destroyed them. 
PSA.78.46	And he gave their crop to the locusts 
PSA.78.46	and their labor to the locust.
PSA.78.47	He destroyed their vines with hail 
PSA.78.47	and their sycamore trees with sleet.
PSA.78.48	He also handed their cattle over to the hail 
PSA.78.48	and their livestock to the lightning bolts. 
PSA.78.49	He sent against them his fierce anger, 
PSA.78.49	rage and indignation and trouble, 
PSA.78.49	a band of destroying
PSA.78.50	He cleared a path for his anger. 
PSA.78.50	He did not spare them
PSA.78.50	but handed their life over to the plague. 
PSA.78.51	And he struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, 
PSA.78.51	the first of their virility in the tents of Ham. 
PSA.78.52	Then he led out his people like sheep 
PSA.78.52	and guided them like a herd in the wilderness. 
PSA.78.53	And he led them safely and they were not afraid, 
PSA.78.53	but the sea covered their enemies. 
PSA.78.54	So he brought them to his holy territory,
PSA.78.54	this mountain his right hand acquired.
PSA.78.55	And he drove out nations before them 
PSA.78.55	and allocated them for an inheritance by boundary line, 
PSA.78.55	and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. 
PSA.78.56	But they tested and rebelled against God Most High 
PSA.78.56	and did not keep his statutes. 
PSA.78.57	And they turned and were treacherous like their ancestors.
PSA.78.57	They twisted like a crooked
PSA.78.58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, 
PSA.78.58	and made him jealous with their images. 
PSA.78.59	God heard and he was very angry 
PSA.78.59	and rejected Israel utterly. 
PSA.78.60	So he abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh, 
PSA.78.60	the tent he had placed among humankind. 
PSA.78.61	And he gave his strength into captivity 
PSA.78.61	and his splendor into the hand of the enemy. 
PSA.78.62	He also handed his people over to the sword, 
PSA.78.62	and he was very angry with his inheritance. 
PSA.78.63	Fire devoured his young men, 
PSA.78.63	and his young women
PSA.78.64	His priests fell by the sword, 
PSA.78.64	and his widows did not weep. 
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord awoke like one who had been asleep, 
PSA.78.65	awoke like a warrior who had been drunk with wine.
PSA.78.66	And he beat back his enemies; 
PSA.78.66	he gave them over to perpetual scorn. 
PSA.78.67	And he rejected the tent of Joseph, 
PSA.78.67	and did not chose the tribe of Ephraim, 
PSA.78.68	but chose the tribe of Judah, 
PSA.78.68	Mount Zion
PSA.78.69	And he built his sanctuary like the heights, 
PSA.78.69	like the earth that he established forever. 
PSA.78.70	And he chose David his servant 
PSA.78.70	and took him from the sheepfolds. 
PSA.78.71	He brought him from following nursing ewes 
PSA.78.71	to shepherd Jacob, his people, 
PSA.78.71	and Israel, his inheritance. 
PSA.78.72	And he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, 
PSA.78.72	and led them by the skillfulness of his hands. 
PSA.79.1	O God, the nations have entered your inheritance; 
PSA.79.1	they have defiled your holy temple; 
PSA.79.1	they have reduced Jerusalem to ruins. 
PSA.79.2	They have given the bodies of your servants 
PSA.79.2	as food for the birds of the heavens, 
PSA.79.2	the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the earth. 
PSA.79.3	They have poured out their blood like water 
PSA.79.3	all around Jerusalem, 
PSA.79.3	and there was none to bury them. 
PSA.79.4	We have become a taunt to our neighbors, 
PSA.79.4	a derision and a scorn to those around us. 
PSA.79.5	How long, O Yahweh? Will you be angry forever? 
PSA.79.5	Will your jealousy burn like fire? 
PSA.79.6	Pour out your anger on the nations 
PSA.79.6	that do not know you, 
PSA.79.6	and on the kingdoms 
PSA.79.6	that do not call on your name, 
PSA.79.7	because they
PSA.79.7	and have laid waste his habitation. 
PSA.79.8	Do not remember against us former iniquities; 
PSA.79.8	let your mercies meet us quickly 
PSA.79.8	because we are brought very low. 
PSA.79.9	Help us, O God of our salvation, 
PSA.79.9	for the glory of your name; 
PSA.79.9	and deliver us and forgive
PSA.79.9	for the sake of your name. 
PSA.79.10	Why should the nations say, 
PSA.79.10	“Where is their God?” 
PSA.79.10	Let it
PSA.79.10	by the avenging of the blood of your servants 
PSA.79.10	that was poured out. 
PSA.79.11	Let the groaning of the prisoner come before you. 
PSA.79.11	According to the greatness of your power,
PSA.79.11	spare
PSA.79.12	And return to our neighbors sevenfold upon them
PSA.79.12	their taunts with which they taunted you, O Lord. 
PSA.79.13	Then we, your people and the flock of your pasture, 
PSA.79.13	we will give thanks to you forever. 
PSA.79.13	Generation after generation
PSA.79.13	we will tell of your praise. 
PSA.80.1	Give ear, O shepherd of Israel, 
PSA.80.1	who leads Joseph like a flock. 
PSA.80.1	Shine forth, you who sits enthroned above the cherubim. 
PSA.80.2	Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, 
PSA.80.2	stir up your power 
PSA.80.2	and come for our salvation. 
PSA.80.3	O God, restore us, 
PSA.80.3	and cause your face to shine that we may be saved. 
PSA.80.4	O Yahweh God of hosts, 
PSA.80.4	how long will you be angry
PSA.80.4	against the prayer of your people? 
PSA.80.5	You have fed them the bread of tears; 
PSA.80.5	you have given them tears to drink in full measure.
PSA.80.6	You have made us an object of strife to our neighbors, 
PSA.80.6	and our enemies mock among themselves. 
PSA.80.7	O God of hosts, restore us 
PSA.80.7	and cause your face to shine that we may be saved. 
PSA.80.8	You uprooted a vine from Egypt; 
PSA.80.8	you drove out the nations and planted it. 
PSA.80.9	You prepared a place before it, 
PSA.80.9	and it took deep root
PSA.80.10	The mountains were covered with its shade, 
PSA.80.10	and the mighty cedars with its boughs. 
PSA.80.11	It spread its branches to the sea 
PSA.80.11	and its shoots to the river. 
PSA.80.12	Why have you broken down its walls, 
PSA.80.12	so that all who pass on the road pluck fruit from it? 
PSA.80.13	Swine from the forests devour
PSA.80.13	and creatures of the field feed on it. 
PSA.80.14	Please return, O God of hosts. 
PSA.80.14	Observe from heaven and see, 
PSA.80.14	and pay attention to this vine, 
PSA.80.15	eventhe stalk that your right hand planted, 
PSA.80.15	and concerning the shoot
PSA.80.16	It is burned with fire, cut down. 
PSA.80.16	They perish at the rebuke of your face. 
PSA.80.17	Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, 
PSA.80.17	on the son of humankind whom you made strong for yourself. 
PSA.80.18	Then we will not turn back from you. 
PSA.80.18	Restore us to life, and we will proclaim your name. 
PSA.80.19	O Yahweh God of hosts, restore us; 
PSA.80.19	cause your face to shine that we may be saved. 
PSA.81.1	Shout out to God our strength; 
PSA.81.1	shout joyfully to the God of Jacob. 
PSA.81.2	Lift up a song and strike
PSA.81.2	the pleasant lyre, together with the harp. 
PSA.81.3	Blow the horn at new moon, 
PSA.81.3	at full moon, for our feast day, 
PSA.81.4	because it is a statute for Israel, 
PSA.81.4	an ordinance of the God of Jacob. 
PSA.81.5	He made it a statute
PSA.81.5	when he went out against the land of Egypt, 
PSA.81.5	where I heard a language I did not know.
PSA.81.6	“I removed his shoulder from a burden. 
PSA.81.6	His hands were freed from the basket. 
PSA.81.7	In this
PSA.81.7	Within the secret place of thunder I answered you; 
PSA.81.7	I tested you at the waters of Meribah. 
PSA.81.8	Hear, O my people, and I will admonish you; 
PSA.81.8	O Israel, if you would but listen to me. 
PSA.81.9	There shall be no strange god among you, 
PSA.81.9	and you shall not bow down to a foreign god. 
PSA.81.10	I am Yahweh your God, 
PSA.81.10	who brought you up from the land of Egypt. 
PSA.81.10	Open wide your mouth and I will fill it. 
PSA.81.11	But my people did not listen to my voice, 
PSA.81.11	and Israel did not yield to me. 
PSA.81.12	So I let them
PSA.81.12	they walked in their counsels. 
PSA.81.13	Oh that my people would listen to me; 
PSA.81.13	that Israel would walk in my ways. 
PSA.81.14	I would subdue their enemies quickly, 
PSA.81.14	and turn my hand against their adversaries. 
PSA.81.15	Those who hate Yahweh would cringe before him, 
PSA.81.15	and their fate
PSA.81.16	But he would feed him
PSA.81.16	and I would satisfy you with honey from a rock.” 
PSA.82.1	God stands in the divine assembly;
PSA.82.1	he administers judgment in the midst of the gods.
PSA.82.2	“How long will you judge unjustly 
PSA.82.2	and show favoritism to the wicked?
PSA.82.3	Judge on behalf of the helpless and the orphan; 
PSA.82.3	provide justice to the afflicted and the poor. 
PSA.82.4	Rescue the helpless and the needy; 
PSA.82.4	deliver them from the hand of the wicked.” 
PSA.82.5	They do not know or consider.
PSA.82.5	They go about in the darkness, 
PSA.82.5	so that all the foundations of the earth are shaken. 
PSA.82.6	I have said,
PSA.82.6	and sons of the Most High, all of you. 
PSA.82.7	However, you will die like men,
PSA.82.7	and you will fall like one of the princes.” 
PSA.82.8	Rise up, O God, judge the earth, 
PSA.82.8	because you shall inherit
PSA.83.1	O God, do not rest silently. 
PSA.83.1	Do not keep silent or be still, O God. 
PSA.83.2	For look, your enemies roar, 
PSA.83.2	and those who hate you have lifted their head. 
PSA.83.3	They devise cunning schemes
PSA.83.3	and consult together against your protected ones.
PSA.83.4	They say, “Come, let us annihilate them from being a nation, 
PSA.83.4	so that the name of Israel will be remembered no more.” 
PSA.83.5	For they have consulted together with a unified purpose.
PSA.83.5	They have made a covenant against you: 
PSA.83.6	the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, 
PSA.83.6	Moab and the Hagrites, 
PSA.83.7	Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, 
PSA.83.7	Philistia, with the inhabitants of Tyre. 
PSA.83.8	Assyria also has joined with them. 
PSA.83.8	They provide help
PSA.83.9	Do to them as you did with Midian, 
PSA.83.9	as with Sisera, as with Jabin at the wadi of Kishon. 
PSA.83.10	They were destroyed at En-dor; 
PSA.83.10	they became dung for the ground. 
PSA.83.11	Make their leaders like Oreb and Zeeb, 
PSA.83.11	and all their chiefs like Zebah and Zalmunna, 
PSA.83.12	who said, “Let us take as our possession 
PSA.83.12	the pastures of God.” 
PSA.83.13	O my God, make them like the tumbleweed, 
PSA.83.13	like the chaff before wind. 
PSA.83.14	As fire burns a forest, 
PSA.83.14	and as a flame sets afire mountains, 
PSA.83.15	so pursue them with your tempest 
PSA.83.15	and terrify them with your storm. 
PSA.83.16	Fill their faces with shame, 
PSA.83.16	that they may seek your name, O Yahweh. 
PSA.83.17	Let them be ashamed and terrified forever, 
PSA.83.17	and let them be humiliated and perish 
PSA.83.18	that they may know that you, 
PSA.83.18	whose name is Yahweh, you alone, 
PSA.83.18	are the Most High over the whole earth. 
PSA.84.1	How lovely are your dwelling places, 
PSA.84.1	O Yahweh of hosts! 
PSA.84.2	My soul longs and even fails 
PSA.84.2	for the courtyards of Yahweh. 
PSA.84.2	My heart and flesh sing for joy 
PSA.84.2	to the living God. 
PSA.84.3	Even a bird finds a home, and a swallow a nest for herself, 
PSA.84.3	where she may lay her young, 
PSA.84.3	near your altars, O Yahweh of hosts, 
PSA.84.3	my king and my God. 
PSA.84.4	Blessed are those who dwell in your house;
PSA.84.4	they can ever praise you. 
PSA.84.5	Blessed is the man whose strength is in you; 
PSA.84.5	in their heart are the highways to Zion. 
PSA.84.6	Passing through the Valley of Baca,
PSA.84.6	they make it a spring. 
PSA.84.6	The early rain covers it with blessings
PSA.84.7	They go from strength to strength, 
PSA.84.7	until each appears before God in Zion.
PSA.84.8	O Yahweh, God of hosts, hear my prayer; 
PSA.84.8	give ear, O God of Jacob. 
PSA.84.9	Look at our shield, O God, 
PSA.84.9	and have regard for the face of your anointed one. 
PSA.84.10	Because better is a day in your courtyards 
PSA.84.10	than a thousand elsewhere. 
PSA.84.10	I would rather be at the threshold of the house
PSA.84.10	than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 
PSA.84.11	Because Yahweh God is a sun and a shield; 
PSA.84.11	Yahweh gives grace and honor. 
PSA.84.11	He does not withhold good from those who walk blamelessly. 
PSA.84.12	O Yahweh of hosts, 
PSA.84.12	blessed is the man who trusts you. 
PSA.85.1	O Yahweh, you favored your land. 
PSA.85.1	You restored the fortunes
PSA.85.2	You took away the guilt
PSA.85.2	you covered all their sin. 
PSA.85.3	You withdrew all your wrath; 
PSA.85.3	you turned from your burning anger. 
PSA.85.4	Restore us, O God of our salvation, 
PSA.85.4	and annul your vexation with us. 
PSA.85.5	Will you be angry against us forever? 
PSA.85.5	Will you prolong your anger generation after generation? 
PSA.85.6	Will you not again revive us, 
PSA.85.6	that your people might rejoice in you? 
PSA.85.7	Show us, O Yahweh, your loyal love, 
PSA.85.7	and grant us your salvation. 
PSA.85.8	I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak, 
PSA.85.8	because he will speak peace 
PSA.85.8	to his people, even his faithful ones,
PSA.85.8	but let them not return to folly. 
PSA.85.9	Surely his salvation is near for those who fear him, 
PSA.85.9	that glory may abide in our land. 
PSA.85.10	Loyal love and faithfulness
PSA.85.10	righteousness and peace will kiss. 
PSA.85.11	Faithfulness
PSA.85.11	and righteousness will look down from heaven. 
PSA.85.12	Yes, Yahweh will give what is good, 
PSA.85.12	and our land will give its produce. 
PSA.85.13	Righteousness will go before him, 
PSA.85.13	and it will make his steps a pathway. 
PSA.86.1	Incline, O Yahweh, your ear and answer me, 
PSA.86.1	because I am poor and needy. 
PSA.86.2	Watch over my life because I am faithful. 
PSA.86.2	You are my God; save your servant. 
PSA.86.2	I am the one who trusts you. 
PSA.86.3	Be gracious to me, O Lord, 
PSA.86.3	because I call to you all day long.
PSA.86.4	Make glad the soul of your servant, 
PSA.86.4	because I desire you,
PSA.86.5	For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving, 
PSA.86.5	and abundant in loyal love
PSA.86.6	Heed, O Yahweh, my prayer, 
PSA.86.6	and attend to the voice of my supplications. 
PSA.86.7	In the day of my trouble I call to you, 
PSA.86.7	because you answer me. 
PSA.86.8	There is none like you among the gods, O Lord, 
PSA.86.8	and there are no works like yours. 
PSA.86.9	All the nations that you have made will come 
PSA.86.9	and bow down
PSA.86.9	and glorify your name. 
PSA.86.10	For you are great and doing wondrous things; 
PSA.86.10	you alone are God. 
PSA.86.11	Teach me, O Yahweh, your way, 
PSA.86.11	that I may walk in your truth. 
PSA.86.11	Unite my heart
PSA.86.12	I will give you thanks, O Lord my God, with all my heart, 
PSA.86.12	and glorify your name forever, 
PSA.86.13	because your loyal love is great toward me, 
PSA.86.13	and you will have delivered my life from Sheol
PSA.86.14	O God, arrogant men have risen up against me, 
PSA.86.14	even a gang of ruthless men seek my life, 
PSA.86.14	but they do not set you before them.
PSA.86.15	But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, 
PSA.86.15	slow to anger
PSA.86.16	Turn to me and be gracious to me. 
PSA.86.16	Give your strength to your servant, 
PSA.86.16	and grant victory to the son
PSA.86.17	Do a sign that benefits me, 
PSA.86.17	that those who hate me may see and be put to shame, 
PSA.86.17	because you, O Yahweh, have helped me and comforted me. 
PSA.87.1	His foundation is on the holy mountains. 
PSA.87.2	Yahweh loves the gates of Zion 
PSA.87.2	more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 
PSA.87.3	Glorious things are spoken about
PSA.87.3	O city of God. 
PSA.87.4	I will record
PSA.87.4	in Rahab
PSA.87.4	behold in Philistia and Tyre with Cush, 
PSA.87.4	“This one was born there.” 
PSA.87.5	But with respect to Zion it shall be said, 
PSA.87.5	“Each one
PSA.87.5	for the Most High himself will establish her. 
PSA.87.6	Yahweh will record in writing the peoples, 
PSA.87.6	“This one was born there.” 
PSA.87.7	And while dancing, singers will sing, 
PSA.87.7	“All my springs are in you.” 
PSA.88.1	O Yahweh, God of my salvation, 
PSA.88.1	I cry out by day and through the night before you. 
PSA.88.2	Let my prayer come before you; 
PSA.88.2	incline your ear to my cry. 
PSA.88.3	For my soul is full with troubles, 
PSA.88.3	and my life approaches Sheol. 
PSA.88.4	I am reckoned with those descending to the pit. 
PSA.88.4	I am like a man
PSA.88.5	set free
PSA.88.5	like the slain lying in the grave, 
PSA.88.5	whom you no longer remember, 
PSA.88.5	even those cut off from your hand. 
PSA.88.6	You have set me in the pit below, 
PSA.88.6	in dark places, in the depths. 
PSA.88.7	Your wrath presses upon me, 
PSA.88.7	and you afflict me with all your waves. 
PSA.88.8	You have removed my acquaintances far from me. 
PSA.88.8	You have made me detestable
PSA.88.8	I am confined and cannot go out. 
PSA.88.9	My eye languishes from misery. 
PSA.88.9	I call on you, O Yahweh, every day; 
PSA.88.9	I spread out my hands
PSA.88.10	Do you work wonders
PSA.88.10	Or do the departed spirits
PSA.88.11	Is your loyal love told in the grave, 
PSA.88.11	or your faithfulness in the underworld?
PSA.88.12	Are your wonders
PSA.88.12	or your righteousness
PSA.88.13	But as for me, I cry for help to you, O Yahweh, 
PSA.88.13	and in the morning my prayer comes before you. 
PSA.88.14	Why do you reject my soul, O Yahweh? 
PSA.88.14	Why do you hide your face from me? 
PSA.88.15	I am afflicted and perishing from my youth. 
PSA.88.15	I bear your terrors. I am distraught.
PSA.88.16	Your burning anger has passed over me; 
PSA.88.16	your sudden fears have destroyed me. 
PSA.88.17	They surround me like water all the day; 
PSA.88.17	they circle about me altogether. 
PSA.88.18	You have removed loved one and friend far from me, 
PSA.88.18	my acquaintances far from my darkness. 
PSA.89.1	I will sing forever of Yahweh’s acts of loyal love. 
PSA.89.1	From generation to generation
PSA.89.1	I will make known your faithfulness with my mouth. 
PSA.89.2	For I say, “Forever your loyal love is built up. 
PSA.89.2	The heavens you have established with your faithfulness in them.” 
PSA.89.3	“I made a covenant with my chosen one; 
PSA.89.3	I swore an oath to David my servant: 
PSA.89.4	‘I will establish your descendants forever, 
PSA.89.4	and I will build up your throne from generation to generation.’ ”
PSA.89.5	And so the heavens will praise your wonderful deed, O Yahweh, 
PSA.89.5	even your faithfulness, in the assembly of the holy ones. 
PSA.89.6	For who in the sky
PSA.89.6	Who is like Yahweh among the sons of God, 
PSA.89.7	a God feared greatly in the council of the holy ones, 
PSA.89.7	and awesome above all surrounding him? 
PSA.89.8	O Yahweh God of hosts, 
PSA.89.8	who is mighty like you, O Yah, 
PSA.89.8	with
PSA.89.9	You are ruling the surging of the sea. 
PSA.89.9	When its waves rise, you yourself still
PSA.89.10	You yourself crushed
PSA.89.10	you scattered your enemies with your strong arm. 
PSA.89.11	The heavens are yours, the earth yours as well, 
PSA.89.11	the world with its fullness, because you founded them. 
PSA.89.12	North and south, you created them; 
PSA.89.12	Tabor and Hermon shout joyfully over your name. 
PSA.89.13	You have a mighty arm; 
PSA.89.13	Your hand is strong; your right hand reaches high. 
PSA.89.14	Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne. 
PSA.89.14	Loyal love and faithfulness
PSA.89.15	Blessed are the people who know the joyful shout; 
PSA.89.15	O Yahweh, they walk about in the light of your countenance. 
PSA.89.16	In your name they rejoice all the day, 
PSA.89.16	and in your righteousness they rise up. 
PSA.89.17	For you are the glory of their strength, 
PSA.89.17	and by your favor our horn rises up,
PSA.89.18	because our shield belongs to Yahweh,
PSA.89.18	and our king to the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.89.19	Formerly you spoke in a vision 
PSA.89.19	to your faithful ones, and said, 
PSA.89.19	“I have bestowed help on a mighty man; 
PSA.89.19	I have exalted one chosen from the people. 
PSA.89.20	I have found David, my servant. 
PSA.89.20	With my holy oil I have anointed him, 
PSA.89.21	with whom my hand will be steadfast. 
PSA.89.21	Surely my arm will strengthen him. 
PSA.89.22	The enemy will not deceive him, 
PSA.89.22	and no evil man
PSA.89.23	But I will crush his adversaries before him, 
PSA.89.23	and I will strike those who hate him. 
PSA.89.24	And so my faithfulness 
PSA.89.24	and my loyal love will be with him, 
PSA.89.24	and in my name his horn will rise up. 
PSA.89.25	And I will set his hand on the sea 
PSA.89.25	and his right hand on the rivers. 
PSA.89.26	He will call out to me, ‘You are my Father, 
PSA.89.26	my God, and the rock of my salvation.’ 
PSA.89.27	I will also make him the firstborn, 
PSA.89.27	the highest of the kings of the earth. 
PSA.89.28	Forever I will keep my loyal love for him, 
PSA.89.28	and my covenant will be reliable for him. 
PSA.89.29	I will also establish his offspring forever, 
PSA.89.29	and his throne as the days of the heavens. 
PSA.89.30	If his sons forsake my law 
PSA.89.30	and do not walk in my judgments, 
PSA.89.31	if they defile
PSA.89.31	and do not keep my commandments, 
PSA.89.32	then I will punish their transgression with a rod, 
PSA.89.32	and their guilt with wounds. 
PSA.89.33	But I will not break off my loyal love from him, 
PSA.89.33	and I will not be false against my faithfulness. 
PSA.89.34	I will not defile
PSA.89.34	or alter what proceeded from my lips. 
PSA.89.35	Once
PSA.89.35	‘I will surely not lie to David, 
PSA.89.36	His offspring will endure
PSA.89.36	and his throne as the sun before me. 
PSA.89.37	Like the moon it will be steadfast forever, 
PSA.89.37	and like an enduring witness in the sky.’ ” 
PSA.89.38	But you have spurned and rejected; 
PSA.89.38	you are very angry with your anointed one. 
PSA.89.39	You have repudiated the covenant with your servant; 
PSA.89.39	you have defiled
PSA.89.40	You have broken down all his walls; 
PSA.89.40	you have made his fortifications a ruin. 
PSA.89.41	All passing along the road plunder him; 
PSA.89.41	he has become a taunt to his neighbors. 
PSA.89.42	You have raised the right hand
PSA.89.42	You have made all his enemies rejoice. 
PSA.89.43	You have also turned back the edge of his sword 
PSA.89.43	and have not helped him stand his ground in the battle. 
PSA.89.44	You have made his splendor to cease, 
PSA.89.44	and cast his throne to the ground. 
PSA.89.45	You have cut short the days of his youth; 
PSA.89.45	you have covered him with shame. 
PSA.89.46	How long, O Yahweh? Will you hide yourself forever? 
PSA.89.46	Will your wrath burn like fire forever? 
PSA.89.47	Remember what my lifespan is. 
PSA.89.47	Remember for what vanity 
PSA.89.47	you have created all the children of humankind. 
PSA.89.48	What man can live on and not see death? 
PSA.89.48	Can he deliver his life from the power
PSA.89.49	Where are your former acts of loyal love, O Lord, 
PSA.89.49	that you swore to David by your faithfulness? 
PSA.89.50	Remember, O Lord the taunting of your servants, 
PSA.89.50	how I bear in my bosom the taunts of all the many peoples, 
PSA.89.51	by which your enemies taunt, O Yahweh, 
PSA.89.51	by which they taunt the steps of your anointed one. 
PSA.89.52	Blessed be Yahweh forever. 
PSA.89.52	Amen and Amen. 
PSA.90.1	O Lord, you have been our help
PSA.90.2	Before the mountains were born 
PSA.90.2	and you brought forth the earth and the world, 
PSA.90.2	even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God. 
PSA.90.3	You return man to the dust, 
PSA.90.3	saying,
PSA.90.4	For a thousand years in your eyes 
PSA.90.4	are like yesterday when it passes, 
PSA.90.4	or like a watch in the night. 
PSA.90.5	You sweep them away like a flood. 
PSA.90.5	They fall asleep.
PSA.90.5	In the morning they are like grass that sprouts anew. 
PSA.90.6	In the morning it blossoms and sprouts anew; 
PSA.90.6	by evening it withers and dries up. 
PSA.90.7	For we are brought to an end by your anger, 
PSA.90.7	and we hasten off
PSA.90.8	You have put our iniquities before you, 
PSA.90.8	our hidden sins into the light of your countenance. 
PSA.90.9	For all of our days dwindle away in your rage; 
PSA.90.9	we complete our years like a sigh. 
PSA.90.10	As for the days of our years, within them are seventy years 
PSA.90.10	or if by strength eighty years, and their pride
PSA.90.10	for it passes quickly and we fly away. 
PSA.90.11	Who knows the strength of your anger, 
PSA.90.11	and your rage consistent with
PSA.90.12	So teach us to number our days 
PSA.90.12	that we may gain a heart of wisdom. 
PSA.90.13	Return,
PSA.90.13	And have compassion on
PSA.90.14	Satisfy us in the morning with your loyal love, 
PSA.90.14	that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days. 
PSA.90.15	Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, 
PSA.90.15	for as many years as we have seen calamity. 
PSA.90.16	Let your work be visible to your servants, 
PSA.90.16	and your majesty to their children. 
PSA.90.17	And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, 
PSA.90.17	and establish for us the work of our hands, 
PSA.90.17	yes, the work of our hands, establish it. 
PSA.91.1	One who lives in the secret place
PSA.91.1	will lodge in the shadow of Shaddai.
PSA.91.2	I will say to Yahweh, “You are my refuge and my fortress, 
PSA.91.2	my God in whom I trust.” 
PSA.91.3	For he will deliver
PSA.91.3	from the plague of destruction. 
PSA.91.4	With his feathers he will cover you, 
PSA.91.4	and under his wings you can take refuge. 
PSA.91.4	His faithfulness will be a shield and a buckler.
PSA.91.5	You need not fear the terror of the night, 
PSA.91.5	or the arrow that flies by day, 
PSA.91.6	or the plague that spreads in the darkness, 
PSA.91.6	or the destruction that devastates at noon. 
PSA.91.7	A thousand may fall at your side, 
PSA.91.7	and ten thousand at your right hand, 
PSA.91.7	but it will not come near you. 
PSA.91.8	You will only look with your eyes, 
PSA.91.8	and see the punishment of the wicked. 
PSA.91.9	For you, O Yahweh, are my refuge. 
PSA.91.9	You have made the Most High your dwelling place.
PSA.91.10	No harm will befall you, 
PSA.91.10	and no plague will come near your tent. 
PSA.91.11	For he will command his angels concerning you, 
PSA.91.11	to watch over you in all your ways. 
PSA.91.12	In their hands they will bear you up, 
PSA.91.12	lest you strike your foot against a stone. 
PSA.91.13	You will tread on lion and viper; 
PSA.91.13	you will trample young lion and serpent. 
PSA.91.14	Because he loves me, therefore I will deliver him; 
PSA.91.14	I will protect
PSA.91.15	He will call upon me and I will answer him; 
PSA.91.15	I will be with him in trouble; 
PSA.91.15	I will rescue and honor him. 
PSA.91.16	With long life
PSA.91.16	and show him my salvation. 
PSA.92.1	It is good to give thanks to Yahweh, 
PSA.92.1	and to sing praise concerning your name, O Most High; 
PSA.92.2	to declare in the morning your loyal love 
PSA.92.2	and your faithfulness in the night, 
PSA.92.3	on the ten string, and on the harp, 
PSA.92.3	with a melody on the lyre. 
PSA.92.4	For you, O Yahweh, have made me glad by your work; 
PSA.92.4	by the deeds of your hands I sing for joy. 
PSA.92.5	How great are your deeds, O Yahweh; 
PSA.92.5	how very deep are your thoughts. 
PSA.92.6	The brutish man does not know, 
PSA.92.6	and the fool cannot understand this. 
PSA.92.7	When the wicked flourish like grass 
PSA.92.7	and all the workers of evil blossom, 
PSA.92.7	it is so they can be destroyed forever. 
PSA.92.8	But you are on high forever, O Yahweh. 
PSA.92.9	For behold, your enemies, O Yahweh, 
PSA.92.9	for behold, your enemies will perish. 
PSA.92.9	All the workers of evil will be scattered. 
PSA.92.10	But you have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; 
PSA.92.10	you have anointed me
PSA.92.11	And so my eye looks on my enemies.
PSA.92.11	My ears hear those evildoers who rise up against me. 
PSA.92.12	The righteous
PSA.92.12	They will grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 
PSA.92.13	Planted in the house
PSA.92.13	they will flourish in the courts of our God. 
PSA.92.14	They will still prosper in old age. 
PSA.92.14	They will be fat and luxuriant,
PSA.92.15	to declare that Yahweh is upright. 
PSA.92.15	He is my rock, and there is no injustice
PSA.93.1	Yahweh is king; he clothes himself with majesty. 
PSA.93.1	Yahweh clothes himself; he girds himself with might. 
PSA.93.1	Yes, the world is established so that it will not be moved. 
PSA.93.2	Your throne is established from of old; 
PSA.93.2	you are from everlasting. 
PSA.93.3	The rivers have lifted up, O Yahweh; 
PSA.93.3	the rivers have lifted up their rumbling;
PSA.93.3	the rivers have lifted up their pounding. 
PSA.93.4	Mightier than the rumblings of many waters, 
PSA.93.4	mightier than the mighty breakers of the sea, 
PSA.93.4	Yahweh on high is mighty. 
PSA.93.5	Your testimonies are fully reliable. 
PSA.93.5	Holiness is fitting for your house,
PSA.93.5	O Yahweh, forever.
PSA.94.1	O Yahweh, God of vengeance, 
PSA.94.1	God of vengeance, shine forth. 
PSA.94.2	Rise up, O Judge of the earth. 
PSA.94.2	Repay upon the proud what is their rightful due. 
PSA.94.3	How long will the wicked, O Yahweh, 
PSA.94.3	how long will the wicked exult? 
PSA.94.4	They gush words
PSA.94.4	All the evildoers boast. 
PSA.94.5	They crush your people, O Yahweh; 
PSA.94.5	they oppress your inheritance. 
PSA.94.6	They kill widow and stranger, 
PSA.94.6	and they murder orphans, 
PSA.94.7	while
PSA.94.7	and “The God of Jacob does not pay attention.” 
PSA.94.8	You pay attention, O brutes among the people. 
PSA.94.8	And you fools, when you will show insight? 
PSA.94.9	Will the one who planted the ear not hear? 
PSA.94.9	Will the one who formed the eye not see? 
PSA.94.10	Will the one who instructs nations not rebuke, 
PSA.94.10	the one who teaches humankind knowledge? 
PSA.94.11	Yahweh knows the thoughts of humankind, 
PSA.94.11	that they are to no purpose.
PSA.94.12	Blessed is the man, O Yah, whom you instruct 
PSA.94.12	and teach from your law, 
PSA.94.13	to give him rest from days of trouble, 
PSA.94.13	until a pit is dug for the wicked. 
PSA.94.14	For Yahweh will not abandon his people, 
PSA.94.14	nor forsake his inheritance. 
PSA.94.15	For judgment will return to righteousness,
PSA.94.15	and all the upright in heart will follow after it. 
PSA.94.16	Who rose up for me against the wicked? 
PSA.94.16	Who stood up for me against the workers of iniquity? 
PSA.94.17	If Yahweh had not been my help, 
PSA.94.17	my soul would soon have dwelt in silence. 
PSA.94.18	When I thought,
PSA.94.18	your loyal love, O Yahweh, supported me. 
PSA.94.19	When my troubled thoughts were many within me,
PSA.94.19	your consolations cheered my soul. 
PSA.94.20	Can there be allied with you a throne of destruction, 
PSA.94.20	one that forms trouble based on statute? 
PSA.94.21	They band together against the life of the righteous, 
PSA.94.21	and declare the blameless guilty of blood.
PSA.94.22	But Yahweh has become my high stronghold, 
PSA.94.22	and my God has become my rock of refuge. 
PSA.94.23	And he will repay on them their iniquity, 
PSA.94.23	and by
PSA.94.23	Yahweh our God will destroy them. 
PSA.95.1	Come, let us sing for joy to Yahweh; 
PSA.95.1	let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation. 
PSA.95.2	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; 
PSA.95.2	with songs let us shout joyfully to him. 
PSA.95.3	For Yahweh is the
PSA.95.3	and the great king over all gods, 
PSA.95.4	in whose hand are the unexplored places
PSA.95.4	and the heights of the mountains are his, 
PSA.95.5	to whom belongs the sea that he made, 
PSA.95.5	and the dry land that his hands formed. 
PSA.95.6	Come in, let us worship and bow down; 
PSA.95.6	let us kneel before Yahweh, our maker. 
PSA.95.7	For he is our God, 
PSA.95.7	and we are the people of his pasture 
PSA.95.7	and the sheep of his hand. 
PSA.95.7	Today
PSA.95.8	“Do not harden your heart as at Meribah, 
PSA.95.8	as in the day of Massah in the wilderness, 
PSA.95.9	when your ancestors
PSA.95.9	They put me to the test, 
PSA.95.9	even though they had seen my work. 
PSA.95.10	For forty years I loathed that generation, 
PSA.95.10	and said, ‘They are a people whose heart wanders. 
PSA.95.10	And my ways they do not know.’ 
PSA.95.11	Therefore I swore in my anger, 
PSA.95.11	‘They shall surely not enter into my rest.’ ”

PSA.96.4	he is to be feared above all gods. 
PSA.96.5	For all the gods of the peoples are idols,

PSA.96.13	and the peoples with his faithfulness. 
PSA.97.1	Yahweh is king! Let the earth rejoice; 
PSA.97.1	let many coastlands be glad. 
PSA.97.2	Cloud and thick darkness are surrounding him; 
PSA.97.2	righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. 
PSA.97.3	Fire goes before him, 
PSA.97.3	and devours his enemies round about. 
PSA.97.4	His lightnings light the world; 
PSA.97.4	the earth sees and trembles. 
PSA.97.5	The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh, 
PSA.97.5	at the presence of the Lord of all the earth. 
PSA.97.6	The heavens declare his righteousness, 
PSA.97.6	and all the peoples see his glory. 
PSA.97.7	Let all who serve an image be ashamed, 
PSA.97.7	those who boast about idols.
PSA.97.7	Worship him, all you gods. 
PSA.97.8	Zion hears and is glad, 
PSA.97.8	and the daughters of Judah rejoice 
PSA.97.8	because of your judgments, O Yahweh.

PSA.98.9	He will judge the world with righteousness 
PSA.98.9	and the peoples with equity. 
PSA.99.1	Yahweh is king; let the peoples tremble. 
PSA.99.1	He sits enthroned
PSA.99.2	Yahweh is great in Zion, 
PSA.99.2	and he is exalted over all the peoples. 
PSA.99.3	Let them praise your great and fearful name. 
PSA.99.3	He is holy. 
PSA.99.4	And the strength of the king loves justice.
PSA.99.4	You have established equity; 
PSA.99.4	you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob. 
PSA.99.5	Exalt Yahweh our God, 
PSA.99.5	and worship at his footstool. 
PSA.99.5	He is holy. 
PSA.99.6	Moses and Aaron were among his priests; 
PSA.99.6	Samuel also was among those who called on his name. 
PSA.99.6	They called to Yahweh, and he answered them. 
PSA.99.7	He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. 
PSA.99.7	They kept his testimonies and the statute he gave to them. 
PSA.99.8	O Yahweh our God, you answered them. 
PSA.99.8	You were a forgiving God to them, 
PSA.99.8	but an avenger of their wrong deeds. 
PSA.99.9	Exalt Yahweh our God, 
PSA.99.9	and worship at his holy mountain, 
PSA.99.9	for Yahweh our God is holy. 
PSA.100.1	Shout in triumph to Yahweh, all the earth. 
PSA.100.2	Serve
PSA.100.2	come into his presence with exultation. 
PSA.100.3	Know that Yahweh, he is God; 
PSA.100.3	he made us and we are his.
PSA.100.3	We are his people and the sheep of his pasture. 
PSA.100.4	Enter his gates with thanksgiving, 
PSA.100.4	his courts with praise. 
PSA.100.4	Give thanks to him; bless his name. 
PSA.100.5	For Yahweh is good; his loyal love is forever, 
PSA.100.5	and his faithfulness is from generation to generation.
PSA.101.1	I will sing of loyal love and justice; 
PSA.101.1	I will sing praises to you, O Yahweh. 
PSA.101.2	I will give attention to the way of integrity. 
PSA.101.2	When will you come to me? 
PSA.101.2	I will walk in the integrity of my heart 
PSA.101.2	in the midst of my house. 
PSA.101.3	I will not set before my eyes 
PSA.101.3	any wicked thing. 
PSA.101.3	I hate the work of those who fall away;
PSA.101.3	it will not cling to me. 
PSA.101.4	A perverse heart will depart from me; 
PSA.101.4	I will not know evil. 
PSA.101.5	One who slanders his neighbor in secret, 
PSA.101.5	him I will destroy. 
PSA.101.5	One haughty of eyes and arrogant
PSA.101.5	him I will not endure. 
PSA.101.6	My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, 
PSA.101.6	that they may live with me. 
PSA.101.6	He who walks in the way of integrity, 
PSA.101.6	he shall minister to me. 
PSA.101.7	There will not live in the midst of my house 
PSA.101.7	a worker of deceit. 
PSA.101.7	One who speaks lies 
PSA.101.7	will not remain
PSA.101.8	Each morning,
PSA.101.8	I will destroy all the wicked of the land, 
PSA.101.8	cutting off from the city of Yahweh all evildoers. 
PSA.102.1	O Yahweh, hear my prayer, 
PSA.102.1	and let my cry for help come to you. 
PSA.102.2	Do not hide your face from me 
PSA.102.2	in the day of my trouble. 
PSA.102.2	Incline your ear to me. 
PSA.102.2	In the day I call, answer me quickly, 
PSA.102.3	for my days vanish in smoke, 
PSA.102.3	and my bones are charred like a hearth. 
PSA.102.4	My heart is struck like grass and withers. 
PSA.102.4	Indeed, I forget to eat
PSA.102.5	Because of the sound of my groaning 
PSA.102.5	my bones
PSA.102.6	I am like an owl
PSA.102.6	I am like a little owl of the ruins. 
PSA.102.7	I lie awake and I am 
PSA.102.7	like a lone bird on a roof. 
PSA.102.8	All the day my enemies reproach me; 
PSA.102.8	those who mock me swear oaths against me. 
PSA.102.9	Indeed, I eat ashes like bread 
PSA.102.9	and mix my drink with tears
PSA.102.10	because of your indignation and anger, 
PSA.102.10	for you have picked me up and thrown me away. 
PSA.102.11	My days are like a lengthened shadow, 
PSA.102.11	and I wither like grass. 
PSA.102.12	But you, O Yahweh, abide
PSA.102.12	and your remembrance
PSA.102.13	You rise up and take pity on Zion, 
PSA.102.13	because it is time to favor it, 
PSA.102.13	for the appointed time has come. 
PSA.102.14	Your servants take pleasure in her stones, 
PSA.102.14	and show favor to its dust. 
PSA.102.15	Then the nations will fear the name of Yahweh, 
PSA.102.15	and all the kings of the earth your glory. 
PSA.102.16	For Yahweh will rebuild Zion; 
PSA.102.16	he will appear in his glory. 
PSA.102.17	He will turn his attention to the prayer of the destitute 
PSA.102.17	and will not despise their prayer. 
PSA.102.18	Let this be written for the next generation, 
PSA.102.18	so that a people yet to be created may praise Yah,
PSA.102.19	that he looked down from his holy height. 
PSA.102.19	Yahweh looked from heaven over the earth 
PSA.102.20	to hear the groaning of the prisoner, 
PSA.102.20	to liberate those destined to die,
PSA.102.21	so that they
PSA.102.21	and his praise in Jerusalem, 
PSA.102.22	when the peoples assemble, 
PSA.102.22	together with
PSA.102.23	He has broken my strength along the way; 
PSA.102.23	he has cut short my days. 
PSA.102.24	I say, “My God, do not carry me off 
PSA.102.24	from my life in the middle of my days.” 
PSA.102.24	Your years continue throughout all generations. 
PSA.102.25	Long ago you laid the foundation of the earth, 
PSA.102.25	and the heavens are the work of your hands. 
PSA.102.26	They will perish, but you will endure. 
PSA.102.26	And like a garment they will all wear out, 
PSA.102.26	you will replace them like clothing, and they will be set aside. 
PSA.102.27	But you are the same, 
PSA.102.27	and your years do not end. 
PSA.102.28	The children of your servants will continue, 
PSA.102.28	and their descendants
PSA.103.1	Bless Yahweh, O my soul, 
PSA.103.1	and all within me, bless his holy name. 
PSA.103.2	Bless Yahweh, O my soul, 
PSA.103.2	and do not forget all his benefits: 
PSA.103.3	who forgives all your iniquity, 
PSA.103.3	who heals all your diseases, 
PSA.103.4	who redeems your life from the pit, 
PSA.103.4	who crowns you with loyal love and mercies, 
PSA.103.5	who satisfies your life with good 
PSA.103.5	so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s. 
PSA.103.6	Yahweh does deeds of justice 
PSA.103.6	and judgments for all who are oppressed, 
PSA.103.7	who made known his ways to Moses, 
PSA.103.7	his deeds to the people
PSA.103.8	Yahweh is compassionate and gracious, 
PSA.103.8	slow to anger
PSA.103.9	He does not dispute continually, 
PSA.103.9	nor keep his anger forever. 
PSA.103.10	He has not dealt with us according to our sins, 
PSA.103.10	nor repaid us according to our iniquities. 
PSA.103.11	For as the heavens are high above the earth, 
PSA.103.11	so his loyal love prevails over those who fear him. 
PSA.103.12	As far as east is from west, 
PSA.103.12	so he has removed far from us the guilt of our transgressions. 
PSA.103.13	As a father pities
PSA.103.13	so Yahweh pities
PSA.103.14	For he knows our frame.
PSA.103.14	He remembers that we are dust. 
PSA.103.15	As for man, his days are like the grass. 
PSA.103.15	As the flower of the field, so he blossoms. 
PSA.103.16	When the wind passes over it, it is no more, 
PSA.103.16	and its place knows it no longer. 
PSA.103.17	But the loyal love of Yahweh 
PSA.103.17	is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, 
PSA.103.17	and his righteousness to their children’s children, 
PSA.103.18	to those who keep his covenant 
PSA.103.18	and remember to do his precepts. 
PSA.103.19	Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens, 
PSA.103.19	and his kingdom rules over all. 
PSA.103.20	Bless Yahweh, you his angels, 
PSA.103.20	you mighty heroes who do his word 
PSA.103.20	by obeying
PSA.103.21	Bless Yahweh, all you his hosts, 
PSA.103.21	you his attendants who do his will. 
PSA.103.22	Bless Yahweh, all his works,
PSA.103.22	in all the places of his dominion. 
PSA.103.22	Bless Yahweh, O my soul. 
PSA.104.1	Bless Yahweh, O my soul. 
PSA.104.1	O Yahweh my God, you are very great. 
PSA.104.1	You clothe yourself with splendor and majesty, 
PSA.104.2	you who cover yourself with light as with a garment, 
PSA.104.2	who stretch out the heavens like a tent curtain, 
PSA.104.3	the one who sets beams in the waters for his upper chambers, 
PSA.104.3	who makes clouds his chariot, 
PSA.104.3	who rides
PSA.104.4	who makes his messengers the winds, 
PSA.104.4	his attendants a flame of fire. 
PSA.104.5	He established the earth on her foundations, 
PSA.104.5	so that it will not be moved forever and ever. 
PSA.104.6	You covered it with the deep as with a garment. 
PSA.104.6	The waters stood above the mountains. 
PSA.104.7	At your rebuke they fled; 
PSA.104.7	at the sound of your thunder they ran off. 
PSA.104.8	They ascended the mountains and drained though the valleys 
PSA.104.8	to the place that you established
PSA.104.9	You set a boundary that they may not cross over, 
PSA.104.9	so that they would not return to cover the earth. 
PSA.104.10	You are the one who sends forth springs into the valleys; 
PSA.104.10	they flow between the mountains. 
PSA.104.11	They give drink for every beast of the field. 
PSA.104.11	The wild donkeys quench
PSA.104.12	Along them the birds of the heavens abide. 
PSA.104.12	From among the branches they sing.
PSA.104.13	You are the one who waters
PSA.104.13	from his upper chambers. 
PSA.104.13	The earth is full
PSA.104.14	who causes grass to grow for the cattle 
PSA.104.14	and herbs for the service of humankind, 
PSA.104.14	to bring forth food from the earth, 
PSA.104.15	and wine that makes glad the heart of man, 
PSA.104.15	so that their faces shine from oil, 
PSA.104.15	and bread that strengthens the heart of man. 
PSA.104.16	The trees of Yahweh drink their fill, 
PSA.104.16	the cedars of Lebanon that he planted, 
PSA.104.17	where birds make their nest. 
PSA.104.17	The stork has its home in the fir trees. 
PSA.104.18	The high mountains are for the wild goats; 
PSA.104.18	the cliffs are a refuge for the rock badgers. 
PSA.104.19	He made the moon for appointed times; 
PSA.104.19	the sun knows its time for setting. 
PSA.104.20	You make darkness, and it is night, 
PSA.104.20	when
PSA.104.21	The young lions are roaring for the prey 
PSA.104.21	and seeking their food from God. 
PSA.104.22	When the sun rises, they gather together 
PSA.104.22	and lie down in their dens. 
PSA.104.23	Humankind goes out to its work, 
PSA.104.23	and to its labor until evening. 
PSA.104.24	How many are your works, O Yahweh; 
PSA.104.24	all of them you have done in wisdom. 
PSA.104.24	The earth is full of your creatures. 
PSA.104.25	This is the great and wide
PSA.104.25	in which are moving animals without number, 
PSA.104.25	living things small and great. 
PSA.104.26	There the ships sail. 
PSA.104.26	Leviathan is there that you formed to play with.
PSA.104.27	They all wait for you 
PSA.104.27	to give them their food at the proper time.
PSA.104.28	You give to them; they gather it. 
PSA.104.28	You open your hand, they are filled with what is good. 
PSA.104.29	You hide your face, they are terrified. 
PSA.104.29	You take away their breath, they die 
PSA.104.29	and return to their dust. 
PSA.104.30	You send forth your Spirit,
PSA.104.30	and you renew the face of the ground. 
PSA.104.31	May the glory of Yahweh endure forever. 
PSA.104.31	May Yahweh be glad in his works, 
PSA.104.32	the one who looks at the earth and it quakes, 
PSA.104.32	and touches the mountains and they smoke. 
PSA.104.33	I will sing to Yahweh throughout my life; 
PSA.104.33	I will sing praise to my God while I remain alive.
PSA.104.34	May my meditation be pleasing to him. 
PSA.104.34	I will be glad in Yahweh. 
PSA.104.35	Let sinners perish completely from the earth, 
PSA.104.35	and the wicked not remain alive.
PSA.104.35	Bless Yahweh, O my soul. 
PSA.104.35	Praise Yah.
PSA.105.1	Give thanks to Yahweh; proclaim his name; 
PSA.105.1	make known his deeds among the peoples. 
PSA.105.2	Sing to him; sing praises concerning him; 
PSA.105.2	tell of all his wonderful works. 
PSA.105.3	Boast about his holy name. 
PSA.105.3	Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice. 
PSA.105.4	Make supplication to Yahweh and his might; 
PSA.105.4	seek his face continually. 
PSA.105.5	Remember his wonders that he has done, 
PSA.105.5	his signs and the judgments of his mouth, 
PSA.105.6	O offspring of Abraham his servant, 
PSA.105.6	you descendants
PSA.105.7	He is Yahweh our God; 
PSA.105.7	his judgments are in all the earth. 
PSA.105.8	He remembers his covenant forever, 
PSA.105.8	the word that he commanded 
PSA.105.8	for a thousand generations, 
PSA.105.9	that he made with Abraham, 
PSA.105.9	and by his oath swore to Isaac. 
PSA.105.10	He then confirmed it to Jacob as a statute, 
PSA.105.10	to Israel as an everlasting covenant, 
PSA.105.11	saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan 
PSA.105.11	as the allotment that is your
PSA.105.12	When they were few in number
PSA.105.12	a trifle—and were sojourners in it, 
PSA.105.13	and they wandered about among the nations,
PSA.105.13	from one kingdom to another people, 
PSA.105.14	he allowed no one to oppress them, 
PSA.105.14	and he rebuked kings on account of them, 
PSA.105.15	“Do not touch my anointed ones, 
PSA.105.15	nor harm my prophets.” 
PSA.105.16	Then he called for a famine upon the land; 
PSA.105.16	he broke every supply
PSA.105.17	He sent a man on ahead of them; 
PSA.105.17	Joseph was sold as a slave. 
PSA.105.18	They clamped
PSA.105.18	His neck
PSA.105.19	Until the time his word came about, 
PSA.105.19	the word of Yahweh tested
PSA.105.20	The king sent and he freed him; 
PSA.105.20	the ruler of the peoples sent and let him loose. 
PSA.105.21	He made him lord of his house 
PSA.105.21	and ruler of all his possessions, 
PSA.105.22	to obligate
PSA.105.22	and teach his elders wisdom. 
PSA.105.23	Then Israel came to Egypt, 
PSA.105.23	and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Ham. 
PSA.105.24	And he
PSA.105.24	He also made them
PSA.105.25	He turned their heart to hate his people, 
PSA.105.25	to deal deceitfully against his servants. 
PSA.105.26	He sent his servant Moses, 
PSA.105.26	together with Aaron whom he had chosen. 
PSA.105.27	They set before them the words concerning his signs 
PSA.105.27	and portents in the land of Ham. 
PSA.105.28	He sent darkness and made it dark, 
PSA.105.28	and they did not rebel against his words. 
PSA.105.29	He turned their waters into blood 
PSA.105.29	and it killed their fish. 
PSA.105.30	Their land swarmed with frogs, 
PSA.105.30	even in the chambers of their kings. 
PSA.105.31	He spoke, and there came flies 
PSA.105.31	and gnats throughout all their territory.
PSA.105.32	He gave hail for their rains 
PSA.105.32	and the fire of lightning in their land. 
PSA.105.33	And he struck their vines and fig trees, 
PSA.105.33	and shattered the trees of their territory. 
PSA.105.34	He spoke and there came locusts 
PSA.105.34	and young locusts without number. 
PSA.105.35	And they ate up all the vegetation in their land, 
PSA.105.35	and they ate up the fruit of their ground. 
PSA.105.36	And he struck down all the firstborn in their land, 
PSA.105.36	the first of all their virility. 
PSA.105.37	Then he brought them out with silver and gold, 
PSA.105.37	and there was none among his tribes who stumbled. 
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when they departed, 
PSA.105.38	because the fear of them
PSA.105.39	He spread out a cloud for a covering, 
PSA.105.39	and fire to give light at night. 
PSA.105.40	They
PSA.105.40	and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 
PSA.105.41	He opened the rock and waters flowed; 
PSA.105.41	they coursed
PSA.105.42	For he remembered his holy promise;
PSA.105.42	he remembered Abraham his servant. 
PSA.105.43	And so he brought out his people with joy, 
PSA.105.43	his chosen ones with rejoicing. 
PSA.105.44	And he gave to them the lands of the nations, 
PSA.105.44	and they inherited the labor of the peoples, 
PSA.105.45	so that they might observe his statutes, 
PSA.105.45	and keep his laws. 
PSA.105.45	Praise Yah.
PSA.106.1	Praise Yah.
PSA.106.1	for his loyal love is forever. 
PSA.106.2	Who can utter the mighty deeds of Yahweh, 
PSA.106.2	or proclaim all his praise? 
PSA.106.3	Blessed are those who observe justice, 
PSA.106.3	he who does righteousness at all times. 
PSA.106.4	Remember me, O Yahweh, when you show favor to your people. 
PSA.106.4	Look after me when you deliver, 
PSA.106.5	that I may see the good done your chosen ones, 
PSA.106.5	to be glad in the joy of your nation, 
PSA.106.5	to glory together with your inheritance. 
PSA.106.6	We have sinned along with our ancestors.
PSA.106.6	We have committed iniquity; we have incurred guilt. 
PSA.106.7	Our ancestors
PSA.106.7	They did not remember your many acts of loyal love, 
PSA.106.7	and so they rebelled by the sea at the Red Sea.
PSA.106.8	Yet he saved them for the sake of his name, 
PSA.106.8	to make known his might. 
PSA.106.9	So he rebuked the Red Sea,
PSA.106.9	and he led them through the deep as through a desert. 
PSA.106.10	Thus he saved them from the hand of the hater 
PSA.106.10	and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 
PSA.106.11	But waters covered their adversaries; 
PSA.106.11	not one of them survived. 
PSA.106.12	Then they believed his words; 
PSA.106.12	they sang his praise. 
PSA.106.13	They quickly forgot his works; 
PSA.106.13	they did not wait for his counsel. 
PSA.106.14	And they craved intensely
PSA.106.14	and tested God in the desert. 
PSA.106.15	So he gave to them their request, 
PSA.106.15	but he sent leanness into their souls.
PSA.106.16	And they were jealous of Moses in the camp, 
PSA.106.16	and of Aaron, the holy one of Yahweh. 
PSA.106.17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, 
PSA.106.17	and it covered over the gang of Abiram. 
PSA.106.18	Also fire burned in their assembly; 
PSA.106.18	the flame devoured the wicked. 
PSA.106.19	They made a calf at Horeb 
PSA.106.19	and bowed down to a cast image. 
PSA.106.20	And so they exchanged their glory 
PSA.106.20	for an image of an ox that eats grass. 
PSA.106.21	They forgot God their Savior, 
PSA.106.21	who had done great things in Egypt, 
PSA.106.22	wonders in the land of Ham, 
PSA.106.22	awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
PSA.106.23	So he said he would exterminate them, 
PSA.106.23	had not Moses, his chosen one, 
PSA.106.23	stood in the breach before him, 
PSA.106.23	to reverse his wrath from destroying them. 
PSA.106.24	Then they refused the desirable land; 
PSA.106.24	they did not believe his word, 
PSA.106.25	but grumbled in their tents. 
PSA.106.25	They did not obey the voice of Yahweh. 
PSA.106.26	So he made an oath
PSA.106.26	to make them drop in the wilderness, 
PSA.106.27	and to disperse
PSA.106.27	and to scatter them among the lands. 
PSA.106.28	They also attached themselves to Baal of Peor, 
PSA.106.28	and they ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
PSA.106.29	Thus they provoked to anger by their deeds, 
PSA.106.29	and a plague broke out among them. 
PSA.106.30	Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, 
PSA.106.30	and so the plague was stopped, 
PSA.106.31	and it was reckoned to him as righteousness 
PSA.106.31	throughout all generations.
PSA.106.32	They also angered God at the waters of Meribah, 
PSA.106.32	and it went badly for Moses on account of them, 
PSA.106.33	because they rebelled against his Spirit,
PSA.106.33	and he spoke thoughtlessly with his lips. 
PSA.106.34	They did not exterminate the peoples, 
PSA.106.34	as Yahweh had commanded them, 
PSA.106.35	but they mingled with the nations 
PSA.106.35	and learned their works, 
PSA.106.36	and served their idols, 
PSA.106.36	which became
PSA.106.37	They even sacrificed their sons and daughters 
PSA.106.37	to the demons, 
PSA.106.38	and they poured out innocent blood, 
PSA.106.38	the blood of their sons and daughters, 
PSA.106.38	whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, 
PSA.106.38	and so the land was defiled with the blood.
PSA.106.39	And they became unclean by their works, 
PSA.106.39	and were unfaithful in their deeds. 
PSA.106.40	So Yahweh’s anger burned against his people, 
PSA.106.40	and he abhorred his inheritance. 
PSA.106.41	Then he gave them into the hand of the nations, 
PSA.106.41	and those who hated them ruled over them. 
PSA.106.42	And their enemies oppressed them, 
PSA.106.42	and they were subdued under their hand. 
PSA.106.43	Many times he delivered them, 
PSA.106.43	but they rebelled in their counsel, 
PSA.106.43	and were brought low by their iniquity. 
PSA.106.44	Yet he looked upon their distress 
PSA.106.44	when he heard their cry. 
PSA.106.45	And he remembered his covenant with them, 
PSA.106.45	and relented based on the abundance of his loyal love. 
PSA.106.46	And he let them find compassion
PSA.106.46	before all their captors. 
PSA.106.47	Save us, O Yahweh our God, 
PSA.106.47	and gather us from the nations, 
PSA.106.47	so that we may give thanks to your holy name 
PSA.106.47	and boast in your praise. 
PSA.106.48	Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, 
PSA.106.48	from everlasting and to everlasting. 
PSA.106.48	And let all the people say, “Amen!” 
PSA.106.48	Praise Yah.
PSA.107.1	Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, 
PSA.107.1	for his loyal love is forever. 
PSA.107.2	Let the redeemed of Yahweh declare
PSA.107.2	those whom he has redeemed from the hand of the enemy 
PSA.107.3	and gathered from the lands, 
PSA.107.3	from east and from west, from north and from south.
PSA.107.4	They wandered in the wilderness, in a desert. 
PSA.107.4	They could find no way
PSA.107.5	Hungry and thirsty, 
PSA.107.5	their soul grew faint within them. 
PSA.107.6	Then they cried out to Yahweh in their trouble. 
PSA.107.6	He delivered them from their distresses 
PSA.107.7	and led them by a straight way 
PSA.107.7	to get to a city to inhabit. 
PSA.107.8	Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his loyal love, 
PSA.107.8	and his wonderful deeds for the children of humankind, 
PSA.107.9	for he satisfies the longing soul,
PSA.107.9	and the hungry soul he fills with good. 
PSA.107.10	Those who sat in darkness and gloom, 
PSA.107.10	prisoners of misery and iron— 
PSA.107.11	because they rebelled against the words of God 
PSA.107.11	and spurned the counsel of the Most High, 
PSA.107.12	he therefore humbled their heart with trouble. 
PSA.107.12	They stumbled and there was no helper. 
PSA.107.13	Then they called to Yahweh for help in their trouble; 
PSA.107.13	he saved them from their distresses. 
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of darkness and gloom, 
PSA.107.14	and tore off their bonds. 
PSA.107.15	Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his loyal love 
PSA.107.15	and his wonderful deeds for the children of humankind, 
PSA.107.16	for he shatters the doors of bronze, 
PSA.107.16	and cuts through the bars of iron. 
PSA.107.17	Fools, because of their rebellious way 
PSA.107.17	and their iniquities, were afflicted. 
PSA.107.18	Their soul abhorred all food, 
PSA.107.18	and they approached the gates of death. 
PSA.107.19	Then they called to Yahweh for help in their trouble. 
PSA.107.19	He saved them from their distresses. 
PSA.107.20	He sent his word and healed them, 
PSA.107.20	and he delivered them from their pits.
PSA.107.21	Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his loyal love, 
PSA.107.21	and his wonderful deeds for the children of humankind, 
PSA.107.22	and let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, 
PSA.107.22	and tell of his works with rejoicing. 
PSA.107.23	Those who went down to the sea into ships, 
PSA.107.23	doing business on the high seas,
PSA.107.24	they saw the works of Yahweh, 
PSA.107.24	and his wonderful deeds in the deep. 
PSA.107.25	For he spoke and raised up a stormy wind, 
PSA.107.25	and it whipped up its waves. 
PSA.107.26	They rose to the heavens; they plunged to the depths. 
PSA.107.26	Their soul melted in their calamity. 
PSA.107.27	They reeled and staggered like a drunkard, 
PSA.107.27	and they were at their wits’ end.
PSA.107.28	Then they cried out to Yahweh in their trouble, 
PSA.107.28	and he brought them out of their distresses. 
PSA.107.29	He made the storm be still 
PSA.107.29	and their waves became calm. 
PSA.107.30	Then they were glad because they grew silent, 
PSA.107.30	so he guided them to their desired harbor. 
PSA.107.31	Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his loyal love 
PSA.107.31	and his wonderful deeds for the children of humankind, 
PSA.107.32	and let them exalt him in the congregation of the people, 
PSA.107.32	and praise him in the assembly of the elders. 
PSA.107.33	He turns rivers into a wilderness 
PSA.107.33	and springs of water into thirsty ground, 
PSA.107.34	a fruitful land into a salty place, 
PSA.107.34	because of the evil of its inhabitants. 
PSA.107.35	He turns a wilderness into a pool of water 
PSA.107.35	and a dry land into springs of water. 
PSA.107.36	And he settles the hungry there, 
PSA.107.36	so that they may establish a city to inhabit, 
PSA.107.37	and sow fields and plant vineyards, 
PSA.107.37	that they may yield fruit at harvest.
PSA.107.38	And he blesses them and they multiply greatly, 
PSA.107.38	and he does not let their cattle become few. 
PSA.107.39	When they become few and they are bent down 
PSA.107.39	from the oppression of calamity and grief, 
PSA.107.40	he pours contempt on princes 
PSA.107.40	and causes them to wander in a trackless waste. 
PSA.107.41	But he protects
PSA.107.41	and he makes their families like a flock. 
PSA.107.42	The upright see it and are glad, 
PSA.107.42	and all wickedness shuts its mouth. 
PSA.107.43	Whoever is wise, then let him observe these things, 
PSA.107.43	and let them consider Yahweh’s acts of loyal love. 
PSA.108.1	My heart is steadfast, O God. 
PSA.108.1	I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. 
PSA.108.2	Awake, harp and lyre. 
PSA.108.2	I will awake the dawn.
PSA.108.3	I will give you thanks among the peoples, O Yahweh; 
PSA.108.3	I will give you praise among the nations, 
PSA.108.4	because your loyal love is great above the heavens, 
PSA.108.4	and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds. 
PSA.108.5	Be exalted above the heavens, O God, 
PSA.108.5	and let your glory be above all the earth, 
PSA.108.6	so that your beloved ones may be rescued. 
PSA.108.6	Save by your right hand and answer me. 
PSA.108.7	God has spoken in his holiness, 
PSA.108.7	“I will exult, I will divide up Shechem, 
PSA.108.7	and portion out the valley of Succoth. 
PSA.108.8	Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine. 
PSA.108.8	And Ephraim is the helmet for
PSA.108.8	Judah is my scepter;
PSA.108.9	Moab is my washing pot. 
PSA.108.9	Over Edom I will cast my sandal; 
PSA.108.9	Over Philistia I will shout in triumph.” 
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me to the fortified city? 
PSA.108.10	Who will lead me to Edom? 
PSA.108.11	Have you not rejected us, O God, 
PSA.108.11	and not gone out with our armies, O God? 
PSA.108.12	Give us help against the enemy, 
PSA.108.12	for the help of humankind is futile. 
PSA.108.13	Through God we will do valiantly,
PSA.108.13	and it is he who will tread down our enemies. 
PSA.109.1	O God of my praise, do not keep silent, 
PSA.109.2	for wicked and deceitful mouths
PSA.109.2	have opened against me. 
PSA.109.2	They speak to me with a lying tongue. 
PSA.109.3	They also surround me with words of hate, 
PSA.109.3	and fight me without cause. 
PSA.109.4	In return for my love they accuse me, 
PSA.109.4	though I am in prayer.
PSA.109.5	So they inflicted evil against me in return for good 
PSA.109.5	and hatred in return for my love. 
PSA.109.6	Appoint over him a wicked man, 
PSA.109.6	and let an accuser stand at his right hand. 
PSA.109.7	When he is judged, let him come out guilty, 
PSA.109.7	and let his prayer
PSA.109.8	Let his days be few; 
PSA.109.8	let another take his office. 
PSA.109.9	Let his children be orphans, 
PSA.109.9	and his wife a widow, 
PSA.109.10	and let his children wander aimlessly and beg, 
PSA.109.10	and let them plead from their ruins. 
PSA.109.11	Let the creditor seize all that is his, 
PSA.109.11	and let strangers plunder his property. 
PSA.109.12	Let there be none who extend to him loyal love, 
PSA.109.12	nor any who pities his orphans. 
PSA.109.13	Let his descendants
PSA.109.13	Let their name be blotted out in the next generation. 
PSA.109.14	Let the iniquity of his ancestors
PSA.109.14	and let the sin of his mother not be blotted out. 
PSA.109.15	Let them be before Yahweh continually, 
PSA.109.15	that he may cut off their
PSA.109.16	because he did not remember to show loyal love, 
PSA.109.16	but he pursued anyone,
PSA.109.16	or brokenhearted, to slay them. 
PSA.109.17	Because he loved cursing, let it come upon him. 
PSA.109.17	Because he did not delight in blessing, 
PSA.109.17	let it be far from him. 
PSA.109.18	Because he wore a curse as his robe, 
PSA.109.18	let it enter his body
PSA.109.18	and into his bones like oil. 
PSA.109.19	May it be for him like a garment in which he wraps, 
PSA.109.19	and a belt he continually wears.
PSA.109.20	Let this be the punishment for my accusers from Yahweh, 
PSA.109.20	even those who speak evil against my life. 
PSA.109.21	But you, O Yahweh my Lord, 
PSA.109.21	deal with me for your name’s sake. 
PSA.109.21	Because your loyal love is good, deliver me, 
PSA.109.22	for I am poor and needy, 
PSA.109.22	and my heart is wounded within me. 
PSA.109.23	Like a lengthening shadow I am passing away; 
PSA.109.23	I am shaken off like a locust. 
PSA.109.24	My knees buckle
PSA.109.24	and my body grows lean without fat. 
PSA.109.25	And so I am a disgrace to them; 
PSA.109.25	when they see me, they shake their heads.
PSA.109.26	Help me, O Yahweh my God; 
PSA.109.26	save me according to your loyal love, 
PSA.109.27	that they may know that this is your hand, 
PSA.109.27	that you, O Yahweh, you have done it. 
PSA.109.28	Let them curse, but you bless. 
PSA.109.28	When they arise, let them be put to shame, 
PSA.109.28	that your servant may be glad. 
PSA.109.29	Let my accusers put on disgrace, 
PSA.109.29	and let them cover themselves with their shame as with a robe. 
PSA.109.30	I will give thanks to Yahweh exceedingly with my mouth, 
PSA.109.30	and in the midst of many I will praise him, 
PSA.109.31	for he stands at the right hand of the needy, 
PSA.109.31	to save him from those judging his life.
PSA.110.1	A declaration of Yahweh to my lord, 
PSA.110.1	“Sit at my right hand 
PSA.110.1	until I make your enemies your footstool.” 
PSA.110.2	Yahweh will send out your mighty scepter from Zion; 
PSA.110.2	rule in the midst of your enemies. 
PSA.110.3	Your people will volunteer
PSA.110.3	In holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, 
PSA.110.3	you will have the dew of your youth.
PSA.110.4	Yahweh has sworn and he will not change his mind, 
PSA.110.4	“You are a priest forever 
PSA.110.4	according to the manner of Melchizedek.” 
PSA.110.5	O Lord, at your right hand 
PSA.110.5	he will shatter kings in the day of his anger. 
PSA.110.6	He will judge among the nations; 
PSA.110.6	he will fill them with corpses. 
PSA.110.6	He will shatter the rulers
PSA.110.7	He will drink from the stream by the road; 
PSA.110.7	therefore he will lift up his head. 
PSA.111.1	Praise Yah!
PSA.111.1	I will give thanks to Yahweh with all my heart, 
PSA.111.1	in the assembly of the upright and the congregation. 
PSA.111.2	The works of Yahweh are great, 
PSA.111.2	studied
PSA.111.3	Full of splendor and majesty is his work, 
PSA.111.3	and his righteousness endures forever. 
PSA.111.4	He has made his wonders to be remembered;
PSA.111.4	Yahweh is gracious and compassionate. 
PSA.111.5	He gives food to those who fear him; 
PSA.111.5	he remembers his covenant forever. 
PSA.111.6	He has declared the power of his works for his people, 
PSA.111.6	by giving to them the inheritance of the nations. 
PSA.111.7	The works of his hands are faithfulness and justice; 
PSA.111.7	all his precepts are reliable. 
PSA.111.8	They are sustained forever and ever, 
PSA.111.8	done with faithfulness and uprightness. 
PSA.111.9	He has sent redemption to his people; 
PSA.111.9	he has commanded his covenant forever; 
PSA.111.9	holy and fearful is his name. 
PSA.111.10	The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom; 
PSA.111.10	all who do them
PSA.111.10	His praise endures forever. 
PSA.112.1	Praise Yah!
PSA.112.1	Blessed is the man who fears Yahweh; 
PSA.112.1	he takes great delight in his commands. 
PSA.112.2	His descendants
PSA.112.2	the generation of the upright will be blessed. 
PSA.112.3	Wealth and riches are in his house, 
PSA.112.3	and his righteousness endures forever. 
PSA.112.4	His light rises in the darkness for the upright; 
PSA.112.4	he is gracious and compassionate and righteous. 
PSA.112.5	It goes well for a man who is gracious and lends, 
PSA.112.5	who conducts his business properly.
PSA.112.6	For he will not be shaken forever; 
PSA.112.6	the righteous will be remembered forever.
PSA.112.7	He is not afraid of bad news; 
PSA.112.7	his heart is steadfast, secure
PSA.112.8	His heart is sustained; he will not be afraid, 
PSA.112.8	until he looks in triumph on his enemies. 
PSA.112.9	He gives lavishly
PSA.112.9	his righteousness endures forever. 
PSA.112.9	His horn rises high in honor. 
PSA.112.10	The wicked
PSA.112.10	He gnashes his teeth and becomes weak.
PSA.112.10	The desire of the wicked
PSA.113.1	Praise Yah!
PSA.113.1	Praise, O servants of Yahweh, 
PSA.113.1	praise the name of Yahweh. 
PSA.113.2	Let the name of Yahweh be blessed, 
PSA.113.2	from now until forever. 
PSA.113.3	From the rising of the sun to its setting, 
PSA.113.3	let the name of Yahweh be blessed. 
PSA.113.4	Yahweh is high above all nations; 
PSA.113.4	his glory is above the heavens. 
PSA.113.5	Who is like Yahweh our God, 
PSA.113.5	who is enthroned on high,
PSA.113.6	who condescends to look at
PSA.113.6	what is in the heavens and in the earth? 
PSA.113.7	He raises the helpless from the dust; 
PSA.113.7	he lifts the needy from the ash heap, 
PSA.113.8	to seat them with princes, 
PSA.113.8	with the princes of his people. 
PSA.113.9	He causes the barren woman of the house to dwell 
PSA.113.9	as the happy mother of children. 
PSA.113.9	Praise Yah!
PSA.114.1	When Israel went out from Egypt, 
PSA.114.1	the house of Jacob from a people of a strange language, 
PSA.114.2	Judah became his sanctuary, 
PSA.114.2	Israel his dominion. 
PSA.114.3	The sea looked and fled; 
PSA.114.3	the Jordan turned back. 
PSA.114.4	The mountains skipped like rams, 
PSA.114.4	the hills like lambs.
PSA.114.5	What’s with you, O sea, that you fled? 
PSA.114.5	O Jordan, that you turned back? 
PSA.114.6	O mountains, that you skipped like rams? 
PSA.114.6	O hills, like lambs? 
PSA.114.7	At the presence of the Lord writhe, O earth,
PSA.114.7	at the presence of the God of Jacob, 
PSA.114.8	who turned the rock into a pool of water, 
PSA.114.8	flinty stone into a spring of water. 
PSA.115.1	Not to us, O Yahweh, not to us, 
PSA.115.1	but to your name give glory, 
PSA.115.1	because of your loyal love, 
PSA.115.1	because of your faithfulness. 
PSA.115.2	Why should the nations say, 
PSA.115.2	“Where, pray tell,
PSA.115.3	But our God is in the heavens; 
PSA.115.3	all that he desires, he does. 
PSA.115.4	Their idols are silver and gold, 
PSA.115.4	the work of human hands. 
PSA.115.5	They have mouths, but cannot speak; 
PSA.115.5	they have eyes, but cannot see; 
PSA.115.6	they have ears, but cannot hear; 
PSA.115.6	they have noses, but cannot smell; 
PSA.115.7	they have their hands, but they cannot feel, 
PSA.115.7	their feet, but they cannot walk; 
PSA.115.7	they cannot utter a sound in their throats. 
PSA.115.8	Those who make them become like them, 
PSA.115.8	as does everyone who trusts in them. 
PSA.115.9	O Israel, trust Yahweh; 
PSA.115.9	he is their help and their shield. 
PSA.115.10	O house of Aaron, trust in Yahweh; 
PSA.115.10	he is their help and their shield. 
PSA.115.11	You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh; 
PSA.115.11	he is their help and their shield. 
PSA.115.12	Yahweh remembers us; he will bless us. 
PSA.115.12	He will bless the house of Israel; 
PSA.115.12	he will bless the house of Aaron. 
PSA.115.13	He will bless those who fear Yahweh, 
PSA.115.13	the small with the great. 
PSA.115.14	May Yahweh give you increase, 
PSA.115.14	you and your children. 
PSA.115.15	May you be blessed by Yahweh, 
PSA.115.15	who made heaven and earth. 
PSA.115.16	The heavens are Yahweh’s heavens, 
PSA.115.16	but the earth he has given to the children of humankind. 
PSA.115.17	The dead do not praise Yah,
PSA.115.17	nor any descending into silence. 
PSA.115.18	It is we, we will bless Yah
PSA.115.18	from now until forever. 
PSA.115.18	Praise Yah!
PSA.116.1	I love him, because Yahweh has heard 
PSA.116.1	the voice of my supplications.
PSA.116.2	Because he has inclined his ear to me, 
PSA.116.2	I will call all my days.
PSA.116.3	The ropes of death encircled me, 
PSA.116.3	and the distresses of Sheol found me. 
PSA.116.3	I found trouble and grief. 
PSA.116.4	Then I called on the name of Yahweh: 
PSA.116.4	“O Yahweh, please save my life!” 
PSA.116.5	Gracious is Yahweh and righteous, 
PSA.116.5	and our God is merciful. 
PSA.116.6	Yahweh watches over the simple. 
PSA.116.6	I was brought low, but he gave me victory. 
PSA.116.7	Return, O my soul, to your repose, 
PSA.116.7	for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you. 
PSA.116.8	For you have rescued me
PSA.116.8	my eyes
PSA.116.9	I will walk before Yahweh 
PSA.116.9	in the land
PSA.116.10	I believed when I spoke, 
PSA.116.10	“I am afflicted greatly.” 
PSA.116.11	I said in my haste, 
PSA.116.11	“Everyone
PSA.116.12	What shall I give back to Yahweh 
PSA.116.12	for all his benefits to me? 
PSA.116.13	I will lift up the cup of salvation 
PSA.116.13	and proclaim the name of Yahweh. 
PSA.116.14	I will pay my vows made to Yahweh 
PSA.116.14	in the presence of all his people. 
PSA.116.15	Costly in Yahweh’s view
PSA.116.15	the death of his faithful ones. 
PSA.116.16	Ah, Yahweh, I am indeed your servant; 
PSA.116.16	I am your servant, the child of your maidservant. 
PSA.116.16	You have loosed my bonds. 
PSA.116.17	I will offer to you a sacrifice of thanksgiving, 
PSA.116.17	and proclaim the name of Yahweh. 
PSA.116.18	I will pay my vows made to Yahweh 
PSA.116.18	in the presence of all his people, 
PSA.116.19	in the courts of the house
PSA.116.19	in the midst of you, O Jerusalem. 
PSA.116.19	Praise Yah!
PSA.117.1	Praise Yahweh, all you nations; 
PSA.117.1	extol him, all you peoples. 
PSA.117.2	For his loyal love is mighty on our behalf, 
PSA.117.2	and the faithfulness of Yahweh is forever. 
PSA.117.2	Praise Yah!
PSA.118.1	Give thanks to Yahweh for he is good, 
PSA.118.1	for his loyal love is forever. 
PSA.118.2	Let Israel say, 
PSA.118.2	“His loyal love is forever.” 
PSA.118.3	Let the house of Aaron say, 
PSA.118.3	“His loyal love is forever.” 
PSA.118.4	Let those who fear Yahweh say, 
PSA.118.4	“His loyal love is forever.” 
PSA.118.5	Out of my distress I called to Yah.
PSA.118.5	Yah answered me, setting me in a broad place. 
PSA.118.6	Yahweh is for me; I do not fear. 
PSA.118.6	What can mere humans
PSA.118.7	Yahweh is for me as my helper, 
PSA.118.7	and so I will look in triumph on those who hate me. 
PSA.118.8	It is better to take refuge in Yahweh 
PSA.118.8	than to trust in humans.
PSA.118.9	It is better to take refuge in Yahweh 
PSA.118.9	than to trust princes. 
PSA.118.10	All nations surrounded me. 
PSA.118.10	In the name of Yahweh I opposed them indeed. 
PSA.118.11	They surrounded me; yes, they surrounded me. 
PSA.118.11	In the name of Yahweh I opposed them indeed. 
PSA.118.12	They surrounded me like bees; 
PSA.118.12	they were extinguished like a fire of thorns. 
PSA.118.12	In the name of Yahweh I opposed them indeed. 
PSA.118.13	You pushed me hard
PSA.118.13	but Yahweh helped me. 
PSA.118.14	Yah
PSA.118.14	and he has become my salvation.
PSA.118.15	The sound of rejoicing and salvation
PSA.118.15	is in the tents of the righteous;

PSA.118.16	the right hand of Yahweh has done valiantly. 
PSA.118.17	I will not die but live, 
PSA.118.17	and tell of the works of Yah.
PSA.118.18	Yah has disciplined me severely, 
PSA.118.18	but he did not consign
PSA.118.19	Open to me the gates of righteousness, 
PSA.118.19	that I may enter through them 
PSA.118.19	and give thanks to Yah.
PSA.118.20	This is the gate of Yahweh, 
PSA.118.20	through which the righteous will enter. 
PSA.118.21	I will give thanks to you for you have answered me, 
PSA.118.21	and you have become my salvation.

PSA.119.11	so that I may not sin against you. 
PSA.119.12	Blessed are you, O Yahweh. 
PSA.119.12	Teach me your statutes. 
PSA.119.13	With my lips I have told of 
PSA.119.13	all the ordinances of your mouth.

PSA.119.20	My soul is crushed with longing 
PSA.119.20	for your ordinances at all times.

PSA.119.50	that your word
PSA.119.51	The arrogant utterly deride me; 
PSA.119.51	I have not turned aside from your law. 
PSA.119.52	I remember your ordinances of old, O Yahweh, 
PSA.119.52	and I take comfort. 
PSA.119.53	Rage seizes me because of the wicked, 
PSA.119.53	those who forsake your law. 
PSA.119.54	Your statutes have been my songs 
PSA.119.54	in the house of my sojourning. 
PSA.119.55	I remember your name in the night, O Yahweh, 
PSA.119.55	and I heed your law.

PSA.119.59	and turn my feet to your testimonies. 
PSA.119.60	I hurry and do not delay 
PSA.119.60	to heed your commands. 
PSA.119.61	The cords of the wicked surround me, 
PSA.119.61	but I do not forget your law. 
PSA.119.62	In the middle of the night I rise to give you thanks, 
PSA.119.62	because of your righteous ordinances. 
PSA.119.63	I am a companion of all who fear you 
PSA.119.63	and heed your precepts.

PSA.119.69	The arrogant smear me with lies;
PSA.119.69	I keep your precepts with my whole heart. 
PSA.119.70	Their heart is insensitive like fat;
PSA.119.70	As for me, I take delight in your law. 
PSA.119.71	It is good for me that I was afflicted, 
PSA.119.71	so that I might learn your statutes. 
PSA.119.72	The law of your mouth is better to me 
PSA.119.72	than thousands of gold and silver coins. 
PSA.119.73	Your hands have made me and established me; 
PSA.119.73	give me understanding that I may learn your commands. 
PSA.119.74	Those who fear you will see me and be glad, 
PSA.119.74	because I hope in your word. 
PSA.119.75	I know, O Yahweh, that your judgments are right, 
PSA.119.75	and that in faithfulness you afflicted me. 
PSA.119.76	Please let your loyal love comfort me, 
PSA.119.76	according to your word
PSA.119.77	Let your mercies come to me, that I may live, 
PSA.119.77	for your law is my delight. 
PSA.119.78	Let the arrogant be put to shame, 
PSA.119.78	because they have wronged me with lies.

PSA.119.79	even those who know
PSA.119.80	May my heart be blameless in your statutes, 
PSA.119.80	so that I may not be ashamed. 
PSA.119.81	My soul languishes for your salvation; 
PSA.119.81	I hope in your word. 
PSA.119.82	My eyes long for
PSA.119.82	saying, “When will you comfort me?” 
PSA.119.83	For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, 
PSA.119.83	yet I have not forgotten your statutes. 
PSA.119.84	How many are the days of your servant? 
PSA.119.84	When will you execute justice against those who persecute me? 
PSA.119.85	The arrogant have dug pits
PSA.119.85	which is not according to
PSA.119.86	All your commands are faithful.

PSA.119.91	By your ordinances they stand today, 
PSA.119.91	for all are your servants. 
PSA.119.92	Unless your law had been my delight, 
PSA.119.92	then I would have perished in my misery. 
PSA.119.93	I will not ever forget your precepts, 
PSA.119.93	for by them you revive me.

PSA.119.104	therefore I hate every false way. 
PSA.119.105	Your word is a lamp to my feet 
PSA.119.105	and a light to my path. 
PSA.119.106	I have sworn an oath and confirmed it, 
PSA.119.106	to heed your righteous ordinances.

PSA.119.108	and teach me your ordinances.

PSA.119.151	You are near, O Yahweh, 
PSA.119.151	and all your commands are truth. 
PSA.119.152	Concerning your testimonies, I knew long ago

PSA.119.157	My persecutors and enemies are many, 
PSA.119.157	yet I do not turn aside from your testimonies. 
PSA.119.158	I see the treacherous and I feel disgust,

PSA.119.160	The whole
PSA.119.160	and your every righteous judgment endures forever.

PSA.119.161	but my heart trembles because of your word.
PSA.119.162	I am rejoicing over your word, 
PSA.119.162	like one who finds great spoil.

PSA.119.166	and do your commands. 
PSA.119.167	My soul heeds your testimonies, 
PSA.119.167	and I love them exceedingly. 
PSA.119.168	I heed your precepts and testimonies, 
PSA.119.168	because all my ways are before you. 
PSA.119.169	Let my cry come before you, O Yahweh; 
PSA.119.169	give me understanding according to your word. 
PSA.119.170	Let my plea come before you; 
PSA.119.170	Deliver me according to your word.
PSA.119.171	Let my lips pour out praise,

PSA.119.176	I have wandered like a lost sheep; seek your servant, 
PSA.119.176	because I do not forget your commands. 
PSA.120.1	In my distress I called to Yahweh, 
PSA.120.1	and he answered me. 
PSA.120.2	“Deliver my life, O Yahweh, from lying lips, 
PSA.120.2	from a deceitful tongue.” 
PSA.120.3	What shall be given to you,
PSA.120.3	and what more shall be done to you, 
PSA.120.3	deceitful tongue? 
PSA.120.4	The sharpened arrows of a warrior, 
PSA.120.4	with burning charcoals from broom trees. 
PSA.120.5	Woe to me, that I sojourn in Meshech, 
PSA.120.5	that I dwell among the tents of Kedar. 
PSA.120.6	Too long my soul has had its dwelling 
PSA.120.6	near one who hates peace. 
PSA.120.7	I am for peace, but when I speak, 
PSA.120.7	they are for war. 
PSA.121.1	I lift up my eyes to the mountains; 
PSA.121.1	whence will my help come? 
PSA.121.2	My help is from Yahweh, 
PSA.121.2	maker of heaven and earth. 
PSA.121.3	He will not allow your foot to be moved; 
PSA.121.3	he who protects you will not slumber. 
PSA.121.4	Look, he will not slumber and he will not sleep— 
PSA.121.4	he who protects Israel. 
PSA.121.5	Yahweh is your protector; 
PSA.121.5	Yahweh is your shade at your right hand. 
PSA.121.6	The sun will not strike you by day, 
PSA.121.6	nor the moon by night. 
PSA.121.7	Yahweh will protect you from all evil;
PSA.121.7	he will protect your life. 
PSA.121.8	Yahweh will protect your going out and your coming in 
PSA.121.8	from now until forever. 
PSA.122.1	I rejoiced in those who said to me, 
PSA.122.1	“Let us go to the house
PSA.122.2	Our feet are standing 
PSA.122.2	within your gates, O Jerusalem— 
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem that is built 
PSA.122.3	as a city that is joined together, 
PSA.122.4	where the tribes go up, 
PSA.122.4	the tribes of Yah
PSA.122.4	to give thanks to the name of Yahweh. 
PSA.122.5	For there the thrones sit
PSA.122.5	thrones of David’s house. 
PSA.122.6	Pray
PSA.122.6	“May those who love you be at ease. 
PSA.122.7	May peace be within your walls, 
PSA.122.7	security within your palaces.” 
PSA.122.8	For the sake of my brothers and my friends, 
PSA.122.8	I will say, “Peace be within you.” 
PSA.122.9	For the sake of the house
PSA.122.9	I will seek your good. 
PSA.123.1	I lift up my eyes to you, 
PSA.123.1	the one enthroned
PSA.123.2	Behold, as the eyes of servants 
PSA.123.2	look to the hand of their master,
PSA.123.2	as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, 
PSA.123.2	so our eyes look to Yahweh our God, 
PSA.123.2	until he is gracious to us. 
PSA.123.3	Be gracious to us, O Yahweh, be gracious to us, 
PSA.123.3	for long enough we have had our fill of contempt. 
PSA.123.4	For long enough our soul has had its fill of 
PSA.123.4	the derision of the self-confident, 
PSA.123.4	the contempt of the arrogant. 
PSA.124.1	“If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,” 
PSA.124.1	do let Israel say, 
PSA.124.2	“If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, 
PSA.124.2	when men rose up against us, 
PSA.124.3	then they would have swallowed us alive, 
PSA.124.3	when their anger was kindled against us. 
PSA.124.4	Then the waters would have flooded over us, 
PSA.124.4	the torrent would have passed over our soul. 
PSA.124.5	Then over our soul would have passed 
PSA.124.5	the raging waters.” 
PSA.124.6	Blessed be Yahweh, 
PSA.124.6	who has not made
PSA.124.7	Our soul has escaped like a bird 
PSA.124.7	from the snare of fowlers. 
PSA.124.7	The snare is broken, and we have escaped. 
PSA.124.8	Our help is in the name of Yahweh, 
PSA.124.8	maker of heaven and earth. 
PSA.125.1	Those who trust in Yahweh 
PSA.125.1	are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, 
PSA.125.1	but abides forever. 
PSA.125.2	As mountains are round about Jerusalem, 
PSA.125.2	so Yahweh is round about his people, 
PSA.125.2	from now until forever. 
PSA.125.3	For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest 
PSA.125.3	on the land
PSA.125.3	lest the righteous stretch out 
PSA.125.3	their hands to do wickedness.
PSA.125.4	Do good, O Yahweh, to the good, 
PSA.125.4	and to those upright in their hearts. 
PSA.125.5	But regarding those who turn aside to their crooked ways, 
PSA.125.5	Yahweh will lead them away with the evildoers. 
PSA.125.5	Peace be upon Israel. 
PSA.126.1	When Yahweh restored the fortunes
PSA.126.1	we were like dreamers. 
PSA.126.2	Then our mouth was filled with laughter, 
PSA.126.2	and our tongue with rejoicing. 
PSA.126.2	Then they said among the nations, 
PSA.126.2	“Yahweh has done great things for these people.” 
PSA.126.3	Yahweh has done great things for us; 
PSA.126.3	we are glad. 
PSA.126.4	Restore, O Yahweh, our fortunes
PSA.126.4	like the streams in the Negeb.
PSA.126.5	Those who sow with tears 
PSA.126.5	shall reap with rejoicing. 
PSA.126.6	He who diligently goes out with weeping, 
PSA.126.6	carrying the seed bag, 
PSA.126.6	shall certainly come in with rejoicing, 
PSA.126.6	carrying his sheaves. 
PSA.127.1	Unless Yahweh builds a house, 
PSA.127.1	its builders labor at it in vain. 
PSA.127.1	Unless Yahweh guards a city, 
PSA.127.1	a guard watches in vain. 
PSA.127.2	It is in vain for you who rise early and sit late, 
PSA.127.2	eating the bread of anxious toil, 
PSA.127.2	when thus he
PSA.127.3	Look, children
PSA.127.3	the fruit of the womb is a reward. 
PSA.127.4	Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, 
PSA.127.4	so are the children
PSA.127.5	Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them.
PSA.127.5	They shall not be put to shame 
PSA.127.5	when they speak with enemies at the gate. 
PSA.128.1	Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh, 
PSA.128.1	who walks in his ways. 
PSA.128.2	You will indeed eat of the labor of your hands; 
PSA.128.2	you will be happy and it will be well with you. 
PSA.128.3	Your wife will be like a fruitful vine 
PSA.128.3	within
PSA.128.3	Your children
PSA.128.3	about your table. 
PSA.128.4	Look, for thus shall a man be blessed 
PSA.128.4	who fears Yahweh.
PSA.128.5	May Yahweh bless you from Zion, 
PSA.128.5	that you may see the good of Jerusalem 
PSA.128.5	all the days of your life, 
PSA.128.6	and that you may see your children’s children. 
PSA.128.6	May peace be upon Israel. 
PSA.129.1	“Too often
PSA.129.1	Let Israel say, 
PSA.129.2	“Too often
PSA.129.2	yet they have not prevailed against me. 
PSA.129.3	On my back plowmen have plowed. 
PSA.129.3	They have made their furrows
PSA.129.4	Yahweh is righteous. 
PSA.129.4	He has cut the ropes
PSA.129.5	Let all be put to shame and repulsed 
PSA.129.5	who hate Zion. 
PSA.129.6	Let them be like grass on the housetops, 
PSA.129.6	that withers before it grows up, 
PSA.129.7	with which a reaper cannot fill his hand, 
PSA.129.7	nor the binder of sheaves his arms,
PSA.129.8	so that passersby do not say, 
PSA.129.8	“The blessing of Yahweh be upon you. 
PSA.129.8	We bless you in the name of Yahweh.” 
PSA.130.1	Out of the depths I call to you, O Yahweh. 
PSA.130.2	“O Lord, hear my voice. 
PSA.130.2	Let your ears be attentive 
PSA.130.2	to the voice of my supplications. 
PSA.130.3	If you, O Yah,
PSA.130.3	O Lord, who could stand? 
PSA.130.4	But with you is forgiveness, 
PSA.130.4	so that you may be feared.” 
PSA.130.5	I await Yahweh; my soul awaits, 
PSA.130.5	and I wait
PSA.130.6	My soul waits for the Lord 
PSA.130.6	more than watchmen for the morning. 
PSA.130.6	Yes, more than watchmen for the morning. 
PSA.130.7	O Israel, wait
PSA.130.7	For with Yahweh there is loyal love, 
PSA.130.7	and with him there is abundant redemption. 
PSA.130.8	And he will redeem Israel 
PSA.130.8	from all its iniquities. 
PSA.131.1	My heart is not haughty nor my eyes arrogant.
PSA.131.1	And I do not concern myself
PSA.131.1	with things too great and difficult for me. 
PSA.131.2	Rather I have soothed and quieted my soul, 
PSA.131.2	like a weaned child with its mother, 
PSA.131.2	like the weaned child is my soul with me. 
PSA.131.3	O Israel, hope in Yahweh 
PSA.131.3	from now until forever. 
PSA.132.1	O Yahweh, remember with regard to David 
PSA.132.1	all his affliction.
PSA.132.2	How he swore to Yahweh, 
PSA.132.2	he vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: 
PSA.132.3	“I will not enter into the tent of my house, 
PSA.132.3	I will not go up to the couch of my bed, 
PSA.132.4	I will give no sleep to my eyes, 
PSA.132.4	no slumber to my eyelids, 
PSA.132.5	until I find a place for Yahweh, 
PSA.132.5	a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” 
PSA.132.6	Look, we heard of it in Ephrathah; 
PSA.132.6	we found her in the fields of Jaar.
PSA.132.7	Let us go to his dwelling places;
PSA.132.7	Let us worship at his footstool. 
PSA.132.8	Arise, O Yahweh, to your resting place, 
PSA.132.8	you and your mighty ark. 
PSA.132.9	Let your priests clothe themselves with righteousness, 
PSA.132.9	and let your faithful sing for joy. 
PSA.132.10	For the sake of your servant David, 
PSA.132.10	do not turn away the face of your anointed one. 
PSA.132.11	Yahweh swore in truth to David; 
PSA.132.11	he will not turn back from it. 
PSA.132.11	“One from the fruit of your body
PSA.132.11	I will set on your throne. 
PSA.132.12	If your sons will heed my covenant 
PSA.132.12	and my testimonies that I will teach them, 
PSA.132.12	their sons also forever 
PSA.132.12	will sit on your throne.” 
PSA.132.13	For Yahweh has chosen Zion; 
PSA.132.13	he has desired it for his habitation. 
PSA.132.14	“This is my resting place forever; 
PSA.132.14	here I will dwell, for I have desired it. 
PSA.132.15	I will bless its provisions abundantly; 
PSA.132.15	I will satisfy its poor with bread. 
PSA.132.16	I will also clothe its priests with salvation, 
PSA.132.16	and its faithful will shout exuberantly for joy. 
PSA.132.17	There I will cause a horn to grow for David; 
PSA.132.17	I will set a lamp for my anointed one. 
PSA.132.18	I will clothe his enemies with shame, 
PSA.132.18	but on him his crown will flourish.”
PSA.133.1	Look, how good and how pleasant it is 
PSA.133.1	when brothers dwell together in unity. 
PSA.133.2	It is like the fragrant oil upon the head, 
PSA.133.2	running down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron, 
PSA.133.2	that runs down upon the edges of his robes. 
PSA.133.3	It is like the dew of Hermon that runs down 
PSA.133.3	upon the mountains of Zion, 
PSA.133.3	because there Yahweh commanded the blessing— 
PSA.133.3	life forever. 
PSA.134.1	Look, bless Yahweh, all you the servants of Yahweh, 
PSA.134.1	who serve
PSA.134.2	Lift up your hands in the sanctuary 
PSA.134.2	and bless Yahweh. 
PSA.134.3	May Yahweh bless you from Zion, 
PSA.134.3	he who made heaven and earth. 
PSA.135.1	Praise Yah!
PSA.135.1	Praise him, O servants of Yahweh, 
PSA.135.2	who stand in the house
PSA.135.2	in the courts of the house
PSA.135.3	Praise Yah,
PSA.135.3	Sing praises concerning his name, for it is pleasant. 
PSA.135.4	For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself, 
PSA.135.4	Israel as his special possession. 
PSA.135.5	For I know that Yahweh is great, 
PSA.135.5	and our Lord is greater than all gods. 
PSA.135.6	All that Yahweh desires, he does, 
PSA.135.6	in heaven and on earth, 
PSA.135.6	in the seas and all the depths. 
PSA.135.7	He causes clouds to rise from the edge of the earth; 
PSA.135.7	he makes lightnings for the rain; 
PSA.135.7	he brings out the wind from his storehouses. 
PSA.135.8	Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, 
PSA.135.8	both of humans
PSA.135.9	He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, 
PSA.135.9	against Pharaoh and all his servants. 
PSA.135.10	Who struck many nations 
PSA.135.10	and killed mighty kings— 
PSA.135.11	Sihon the king of the Amorites, 
PSA.135.11	and Og the king of Bashan, 
PSA.135.11	and all the kingdoms of Canaan— 
PSA.135.12	and he gave their land as an inheritance, 
PSA.135.12	an inheritance for his people Israel. 
PSA.135.13	O Yahweh, your name endures forever, 
PSA.135.13	your renown
PSA.135.14	for Yahweh will plead the cause of his people 
PSA.135.14	and will have compassion on his servants. 
PSA.135.15	The idols of the nations are silver and gold, 
PSA.135.15	the work of the hands of humankind. 
PSA.135.16	They have mouths, but cannot speak; 
PSA.135.16	they have eyes, but cannot see; 
PSA.135.17	they have ears, but cannot hear; 
PSA.135.17	there is not even breath in their mouths. 
PSA.135.18	Those who make them become like them, 
PSA.135.18	as does everyone who trusts in them. 
PSA.135.19	O house of Israel, bless Yahweh. 
PSA.135.19	O house of Aaron, bless Yahweh. 
PSA.135.20	O house of Levi, bless Yahweh. 
PSA.135.20	You who fear Yahweh, bless Yahweh. 
PSA.135.21	Blessed be Yahweh from Zion, 
PSA.135.21	who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise Yah!
PSA.136.1	Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, 
PSA.136.1	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.2	Give thanks to the God of gods, 
PSA.136.2	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.3	Give thanks to the Lord of lords, 
PSA.136.3	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.4	To him who alone does great wonders, 
PSA.136.4	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.5	To him who made the heavens with skill,
PSA.136.5	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.6	To him who spread out the earth above the waters, 
PSA.136.6	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.7	To him who made the great lights, 
PSA.136.7	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.8	The sun to rule the day, 
PSA.136.8	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.9	The moon and stars to rule the night, 
PSA.136.9	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.10	To him who struck Egypt through their firstborn, 
PSA.136.10	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.11	And he brought Israel out from among them, 
PSA.136.11	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.12	With a strong hand and an outstretched arm, 
PSA.136.12	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.13	To him who divided the Red Sea
PSA.136.13	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.14	And he let Israel cross over through the midst of it, 
PSA.136.14	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.15	But he tossed Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea,
PSA.136.15	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.16	To him who led his people through the wilderness, 
PSA.136.16	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.17	To him who struck great kings, 
PSA.136.17	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.18	And he killed mighty kings, 
PSA.136.18	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.19	Sihon the king of the Amorites, 
PSA.136.19	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.20	And Og the king of Bashan, 
PSA.136.20	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.21	And he gave their land as an inheritance, 
PSA.136.21	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.22	An inheritance to Israel his servant, 
PSA.136.22	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.23	Who remembered us in our low estate, 
PSA.136.23	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.24	And he rescued us from our enemies, 
PSA.136.24	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.25	The one who gives food to all flesh, 
PSA.136.25	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.136.26	Give thanks to the God of heaven, 
PSA.136.26	for his loyal love endures forever. 
PSA.137.1	By the rivers of Babylon, 
PSA.137.1	there we sat, yes, we wept, 
PSA.137.1	when we remembered Zion. 
PSA.137.2	On the willows
PSA.137.2	we hung up our lyres. 
PSA.137.3	For there our captors asked of us 
PSA.137.3	words of a song, 
PSA.137.3	and our tormentors
PSA.137.3	“Sing for us from a song of Zion.” 
PSA.137.4	How could we sing the song of Yahweh 
PSA.137.4	in a foreign land?
PSA.137.5	If I forget you, O Jerusalem, 
PSA.137.5	let my right hand forget.
PSA.137.6	Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth, 
PSA.137.6	if I do not remember you, 
PSA.137.6	if do not I exalt Jerusalem 
PSA.137.6	above my highest joy. 
PSA.137.7	Remember, O Yahweh, against the sons of Edom 
PSA.137.7	the day of Jerusalem, 
PSA.137.7	the ones who said, “Lay it bare! Lay it bare 
PSA.137.7	to its foundation!” 
PSA.137.8	O daughter of Babylon, about to be devastated, 
PSA.137.8	happy shall be he who pays back to you 
PSA.137.8	what you paid out to us.
PSA.137.9	Happy shall be he who seizes 
PSA.137.9	and smashes your children 
PSA.137.9	against the rock. 
PSA.138.1	I give you thanks with my whole heart; 
PSA.138.1	before the gods I sing your praise. 
PSA.138.2	I bow down toward your holy temple 
PSA.138.2	and give thanks to your name, 
PSA.138.2	because of your loyal love and faithfulness, 
PSA.138.2	for you have magnified your word
PSA.138.3	When
PSA.138.3	you emboldened me in my soul with strength. 
PSA.138.4	All the kings of the earth 
PSA.138.4	will praise you, O Yahweh, 
PSA.138.4	when they have heard the words
PSA.138.5	and they will sing of the ways of Yahweh, 
PSA.138.5	because Yahweh’s glory is great. 
PSA.138.6	Though Yahweh is high, yet he sees the lowly, 
PSA.138.6	but the proud he perceives
PSA.138.7	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, 
PSA.138.7	you preserve me alive. 
PSA.138.7	You stretch out your hand against the anger of my enemies, 
PSA.138.7	and you save me with your right hand. 
PSA.138.8	Yahweh accomplishes things for my benefit. 
PSA.138.8	O Yahweh, your loyal love endures forever; 
PSA.138.8	do not abandon the works of your hands. 
PSA.139.1	O Yahweh, you have searched me, and you know me. 
PSA.139.2	You know my sitting down and my rising up. 
PSA.139.2	You understand my thought from afar. 
PSA.139.3	You search out
PSA.139.3	and are acquainted with all my ways. 
PSA.139.4	For there is not a word yet on my tongue, 
PSA.139.4	but behold, O Yahweh, you know it completely. 
PSA.139.5	You barricade me behind and in front, 
PSA.139.5	and set your hand upon me. 
PSA.139.6	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. 
PSA.139.6	It is set high; I cannot prevail against it. 
PSA.139.7	Where I can go from your Spirit, 
PSA.139.7	or where can I flee from your presence? 
PSA.139.8	If I ascend to heaven, there you are, 
PSA.139.8	and if I make my bed in Sheol, look! There you are. 
PSA.139.9	If I lift up the wings of the dawn, 
PSA.139.9	and I alight on the far side of the sea, 
PSA.139.10	even there your hand would lead me, 
PSA.139.10	and your right hand would hold me fast. 
PSA.139.11	And if I should say, “Surely darkness will cover me, 
PSA.139.11	and the light around me will be as night,” 
PSA.139.12	even the darkness is not too dark for you,
PSA.139.12	and the night shines as the day— 
PSA.139.12	the darkness and the light are alike for you. 
PSA.139.13	Indeed you created my inward parts;
PSA.139.13	you wove me in my mother’s womb. 
PSA.139.14	I praise you, because I am fearfully 
PSA.139.14	and wonderfully made.
PSA.139.14	Wonderful are your works, 
PSA.139.14	and my soul knows it well. 
PSA.139.15	My frame
PSA.139.15	when I was created secretly,
PSA.139.15	and intricately woven 
PSA.139.15	in the depths of the earth. 
PSA.139.16	Your eyes saw my embryo,
PSA.139.16	and in your book they all were written— 
PSA.139.16	days fashioned for me when there was not one of them. 
PSA.139.17	And to me, how precious
PSA.139.17	how vast is their sum. 
PSA.139.18	If I should count them, 
PSA.139.18	they would outnumber the sand. 
PSA.139.18	I awaken, and I am still with you. 
PSA.139.19	If only you would kill the wicked, O God— 
PSA.139.19	so get away from me, you bloodthirsty men—
PSA.139.20	who speak against you deceitfully. 
PSA.139.20	Your enemies take your name in vain. 
PSA.139.21	Do I not hate those who hate you, O Yahweh? 
PSA.139.21	And do I not loathe those who rise up against you? 
PSA.139.22	I hate them with a complete hatred; 
PSA.139.22	they have become my enemies. 
PSA.139.23	Search me, O God, and know my heart; 
PSA.139.23	test me and know my anxious thoughts. 
PSA.139.24	And see if there is in me the worship of false gods,
PSA.139.24	and lead me in the way everlasting. 
PSA.140.1	Rescue me, O Yahweh, from evil men.
PSA.140.1	Preserve me from violent men, 
PSA.140.2	who plan evil things in their heart. 
PSA.140.2	They stir up wars continually. 
PSA.140.3	They sharpen their tongue as sharp as a snake’s; 
PSA.140.3	the venom of a viper is under their lips. 
PSA.140.4	Protect me, O Yahweh, from the hands of the wicked. 
PSA.140.4	Preserve me from violent men, 
PSA.140.4	who have planned to make me stumble.
PSA.140.5	The proud have hidden a trap for me, and cords. 
PSA.140.5	They have spread out a net along the side
PSA.140.5	They have set snares for me. 
PSA.140.6	I say to Yahweh, “You are my God.” 
PSA.140.6	Listen, O Yahweh, to the voice of my supplications. 
PSA.140.7	O Yahweh, my Lord, the strength of my salvation, 
PSA.140.7	you have covered my head in the day of battle. 
PSA.140.8	Do not grant, O Yahweh, the desires of the wicked. 
PSA.140.8	Do not allow them to attain their
PSA.140.9	With respect to the head of those who surround me, 
PSA.140.9	may the harm of their lips cover them. 
PSA.140.10	Let burning coals fall on them; 
PSA.140.10	let them be dropped into the fire, 
PSA.140.10	into bottomless pits from which they cannot rise. 
PSA.140.11	Do not let a slanderer
PSA.140.11	as for the man of violence, let evil hunt him quickly. 
PSA.140.12	I know
PSA.140.12	and justice for the needy. 
PSA.140.13	Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name; 
PSA.140.13	the upright will dwell in your presence. 
PSA.141.1	I call on you, O Yahweh; hasten to me. 
PSA.141.1	Listen to my voice when I call to you. 
PSA.141.2	Let my prayer be set before you as incense, 
PSA.141.2	the lifting up of my palms as the evening offering. 
PSA.141.3	Set a guard, O Yahweh, over my mouth; 
PSA.141.3	keep watch over the door of my lips. 
PSA.141.4	Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, 
PSA.141.4	to practice wicked deeds 
PSA.141.4	with men who do iniquity; 
PSA.141.4	and do not let me eat of their delicacies. 
PSA.141.5	Let a righteous one strike me in kindness, 
PSA.141.5	and let him chasten me. 
PSA.141.5	It is oil for my head;
PSA.141.5	For still my prayer is against their evil deeds. 
PSA.141.6	When their judges are thrown down the sides of a cliff,
PSA.141.6	then they will understand that my words were pleasant. 
PSA.141.7	As when one plows and breaks up the earth, 
PSA.141.7	so our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol. 
PSA.141.8	But
PSA.141.8	I have taken refuge in you. Do not lay bare my soul.
PSA.141.9	Protect me from the grasp
PSA.141.9	and from the snares of evildoers. 
PSA.141.10	Let the wicked fall into their
PSA.141.10	while I escape altogether. 
PSA.142.1	I cry out with my voice to Yahweh; 
PSA.142.1	I implore favor with my voice to Yahweh. 
PSA.142.2	I pour out my complaint before him; 
PSA.142.2	I declare my trouble before him. 
PSA.142.3	When my spirit faints within me, 
PSA.142.3	you know my way. 
PSA.142.3	On the path where I walk, 
PSA.142.3	they have hidden a trap for me; 
PSA.142.4	look to my right and see. 
PSA.142.4	There is no one looking out for me; 
PSA.142.4	there is no escape for me;
PSA.142.4	no one cares for my soul.
PSA.142.5	I cry out to you, O Yahweh. 
PSA.142.5	I say, “You are my refuge, 
PSA.142.5	my portion in the land of the living.” 
PSA.142.6	Attend to my cry, 
PSA.142.6	for I am brought very low. 
PSA.142.6	Deliver me from my pursuers, 
PSA.142.6	for they are stronger than I. 
PSA.142.7	Bring me
PSA.142.7	that I may give thanks to your name. 
PSA.142.7	The righteous will encircle me, 
PSA.142.7	because you will deal bountifully with me. 
PSA.143.1	O Yahweh, hear my prayer; 
PSA.143.1	listen to my supplications. 
PSA.143.1	In your faithfulness answer me, 
PSA.143.1	and in your righteousness. 
PSA.143.2	And do not enter into judgment with your servant, 
PSA.143.2	because no one alive is righteous before you. 
PSA.143.3	For the enemy has pursued my soul; 
PSA.143.3	he has crushed my life to the ground. 
PSA.143.3	He has made me dwell in dark places 
PSA.143.3	like those long dead. 
PSA.143.4	And so my spirit grows faint within me; 
PSA.143.4	my heart within
PSA.143.5	I remember the days of long ago; 
PSA.143.5	I meditate on all your doings.
PSA.143.5	I muse on the labor of your hands. 
PSA.143.6	I stretch out my hands to you; 
PSA.143.6	my soul longs for you like a dry land. 
PSA.143.7	Quickly answer me, O Yahweh; 
PSA.143.7	my spirit fails. 
PSA.143.7	Do not hide your face from me, 
PSA.143.7	or I will become 
PSA.143.7	like those descending to the pit. 
PSA.143.8	Cause me to hear your loyal love in the morning, 
PSA.143.8	for I trust you. 
PSA.143.8	Cause me to know the way that I should go, 
PSA.143.8	for I lift up my soul to you. 
PSA.143.9	Deliver me from my enemies, O Yahweh. 
PSA.143.9	I take refuge in you.
PSA.143.10	Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; 
PSA.143.10	your Spirit is good. 
PSA.143.10	Lead me onto level ground. 
PSA.143.11	For your name’s sake, O Yahweh, preserve my life; 
PSA.143.11	in your righteousness bring me
PSA.143.12	And in your loyal love destroy my enemies, 
PSA.143.12	and exterminate all the adversaries of my soul, 
PSA.143.12	for I am your servant. 
PSA.144.1	Blessed be Yahweh, my rock, 
PSA.144.1	the one who trains my hands for battle, 
PSA.144.1	my fingers for war— 
PSA.144.2	my loyal love and my fortress, 
PSA.144.2	my stronghold and my deliverer, 
PSA.144.2	my shield, and one in whom I take refuge, 
PSA.144.2	the one who subdues peoples
PSA.144.3	O Yahweh, what is humankind that you take knowledge of him, 
PSA.144.3	or the son of man that you take thought of him? 
PSA.144.4	Humankind is like a breath, 
PSA.144.4	his days like a passing shadow. 
PSA.144.5	O Yahweh, bow the heavens and come down; 
PSA.144.5	touch the mountains so that they smoke. 
PSA.144.6	Flash forth lightning and scatter them; 
PSA.144.6	dispatch your arrows and rout them. 
PSA.144.7	Stretch out your hands from on high; 
PSA.144.7	Rescue me and deliver me from many waters, 
PSA.144.7	from the hand of foreigners, 
PSA.144.8	whose mouth speaks falsely, 
PSA.144.8	and their right hand is a false right hand. 
PSA.144.9	O God, I will sing a new song to you. 
PSA.144.9	With a lyre of ten strings I will sing praise to you, 
PSA.144.10	who gives victory to kings, 
PSA.144.10	who rescues David his servant 
PSA.144.10	from the evil sword. 
PSA.144.11	Rescue me and deliver me 
PSA.144.11	from the hand of foreigners, 
PSA.144.11	whose mouth speaks falsely, 
PSA.144.11	and whose right hand is a false right hand, 
PSA.144.12	that our sons may be like plants, 
PSA.144.12	full grown in their youth, 
PSA.144.12	our daughters like corner pillars, 
PSA.144.12	carved in the style of a palace, 
PSA.144.13	that our granaries may be full, 
PSA.144.13	providing produce of all kinds,
PSA.144.13	that our sheep may produce by the thousands, 
PSA.144.13	by the tens of thousands in our open fields, 
PSA.144.14	that our cattle may be pregnant; 
PSA.144.14	that there be no breach in our walls, 
PSA.144.14	and no going out in exile, 
PSA.144.14	and no outcry in our plazas. 
PSA.144.15	Blessed are the people who have it thus. 
PSA.144.15	Blessed are the people whose God is Yahweh. 
PSA.145.1	I will exalt you, my God, O king, 
PSA.145.1	and I will bless
PSA.145.2	Every day I will bless you 
PSA.145.2	and praise your name forever and ever. 
PSA.145.3	Great is Yahweh, and very worthy of praise, 
PSA.145.3	and his greatness is unsearchable. 
PSA.145.4	One generation will laud your works to another, 
PSA.145.4	and will declare your mighty deeds. 
PSA.145.5	On the splendor of the glory of your majesty, 
PSA.145.5	and on your wonderful deeds, I will meditate. 
PSA.145.6	And they will speak of the power of your awesome deeds,
PSA.145.6	and I will tell of your greatness.
PSA.145.7	They will utter 
PSA.145.7	and they will proclaim with joy your righteousness. 
PSA.145.8	Yahweh is gracious and compassionate, 
PSA.145.8	slow to anger
PSA.145.9	Yahweh is good to all, 
PSA.145.9	and his mercies are over all his works. 
PSA.145.10	All your works will praise you, O Yahweh, 
PSA.145.10	and your faithful ones will bless
PSA.145.11	They will speak of the glory of your kingdom, 
PSA.145.11	and talk of your power, 
PSA.145.12	to make known to the children of humankind his mighty deeds, 
PSA.145.12	and the glory of the majesty of his kingdom. 
PSA.145.13	Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, 
PSA.145.13	and your dominion endures throughout all generations.
PSA.145.14	Yahweh upholds all who are falling, 
PSA.145.14	and raises up all who are bowed down. 
PSA.145.15	The eyes of all look hopefully to you, 
PSA.145.15	and you give them their food in due time, 
PSA.145.16	opening your hand, 
PSA.145.16	and satisfying the desire of every living creature. 
PSA.145.17	Yahweh is righteous in all his ways, 
PSA.145.17	and loyal in all his works. 
PSA.145.18	Yahweh is near to all who call on him, 
PSA.145.18	to all who call on him in truth. 
PSA.145.19	He fulfills the desire of those who fear him; 
PSA.145.19	he also hears their cry for help, and saves them. 
PSA.145.20	Yahweh protects all those who love him, 
PSA.145.20	but all the wicked he will exterminate. 
PSA.145.21	My mouth will speak the praise of Yahweh, 
PSA.145.21	and all flesh will bless his holy name 
PSA.145.21	forever and ever. 
PSA.146.1	Praise Yah.
PSA.146.1	Praise Yahweh, O my soul. 
PSA.146.2	I will praise Yahweh while I live; 
PSA.146.2	I will sing praises to my God while I am still alive. 
PSA.146.3	Do not place trust in princes, 
PSA.146.3	in a son of humankind with whom there is no deliverance. 
PSA.146.4	His breath departs; he returns to his plot;
PSA.146.4	on that day his plans perish. 
PSA.146.5	Blessed is the one whose help is the God of Jacob, 
PSA.146.5	whose hope is on Yahweh as his God, 
PSA.146.6	who made heaven and earth, 
PSA.146.6	the sea and all that is in them, 
PSA.146.6	the one who keeps faith
PSA.146.7	who executes justice for the oppressed, 
PSA.146.7	who gives food for the hungry. 
PSA.146.7	Yahweh sets prisoners free; 
PSA.146.8	Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind; 
PSA.146.8	Yahweh raises up those bowed down; 
PSA.146.8	Yahweh loves the righteous; 
PSA.146.9	Yahweh protects
PSA.146.9	He helps up the orphan and the widow, 
PSA.146.9	but the way of the wicked he thwarts.

PSA.147.1	For it is good to sing praises to our God; 
PSA.147.1	for it is pleasant; praise is fitting. 
PSA.147.2	Yahweh is building Jerusalem;

PSA.147.3	He is the one who heals the brokenhearted, 
PSA.147.3	and binds up their wounds. 
PSA.147.4	He counts the number of the stars; 
PSA.147.4	he gives names to all of them. 
PSA.147.5	Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; 
PSA.147.5	his understanding is unlimited. 
PSA.147.6	Yahweh helps the afflicted up; 
PSA.147.6	he brings the wicked down to the ground. 
PSA.147.7	Sing to Yahweh with thanksgiving; 
PSA.147.7	sing praises to our God with lyre, 
PSA.147.8	who covers the heavens with clouds, 
PSA.147.8	who provides rain for the earth,

PSA.147.9	He gives to the animal its food,

PSA.147.15	He sends out his command
PSA.147.15	his word runs swiftly. 
PSA.147.16	He gives snow like wool; 
PSA.147.16	he scatters frost like ashes; 
PSA.147.17	he throws his hail like crumbs. 
PSA.147.17	Who can stand before his cold?
PSA.147.18	He sends out his word and melts them; 
PSA.147.18	he blows his breath, the water flows. 
PSA.147.19	He declares his word to Jacob, 
PSA.147.19	his statutes and his ordinances to Israel.

PSA.149.7	to execute vengeance on the nations 
PSA.149.7	and punishment on the peoples,

PRO.1.1	Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel: 
PRO.1.2	To know wisdom and instruction, 
PRO.1.2	to understand sayings of understanding, 
PRO.1.3	to gain insightful instruction,
PRO.1.3	righteousness and justice and equity, 
PRO.1.4	to give shrewdness
PRO.1.4	knowledge and purpose
PRO.1.5	may the wise hear and increase learning, 
PRO.1.5	and the one who understands gain direction,
PRO.1.6	to understand a proverb and an expression, 
PRO.1.6	words of wisdom and their riddles. 
PRO.1.7	Fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; 
PRO.1.7	wisdom and instruction, fools despise. 
PRO.1.8	My child, may you keep
PRO.1.8	and do not reject your mother’s teachings, 
PRO.1.9	for they are a garland of favor for your head, 
PRO.1.9	and pendants for your neck. 
PRO.1.10	My child, if sinners entice you, do not consent. 
PRO.1.11	If they say, 
PRO.1.11	“Come with us! 
PRO.1.11	We shall lie in wait for blood; 
PRO.1.11	we shall ambush the innocent without cause.
PRO.1.12	Like Sheol,
PRO.1.12	and whole, like those who descend to the pit.
PRO.1.13	We shall find all precious wealth, 
PRO.1.13	we shall fill our houses with booty, 
PRO.1.14	you shall throw your lot in our midst, 
PRO.1.14	there will be one purse for all of us.” 
PRO.1.15	My child, do not walk in their way.
PRO.1.15	Keep your foot from their paths, 
PRO.1.16	for their feet run to evil, 
PRO.1.16	and they hurry to shed blood, 
PRO.1.17	for “in vain
PRO.1.17	in the sight of any winged bird.”
PRO.1.18	They lie in wait for their own blood. 
PRO.1.18	They ambush their own lives. 
PRO.1.19	Thus are the ways of all who are greedy for gain— 
PRO.1.19	it will take the life of its possessors. 
PRO.1.20	Wisdom calls out in the streets, 
PRO.1.20	in the squares she raises her voice. 
PRO.1.21	On a busy corner
PRO.1.21	at the entrances of the gates in the city, she speaks her sayings: 
PRO.1.22	“How long,
PRO.1.22	And how long will scoffers delight in their scoffing, 
PRO.1.22	and fools hate knowledge? 
PRO.1.23	May you turn to my argument!
PRO.1.23	Behold, I shall pour out my spirit upon you; 
PRO.1.23	I will make my words known to you. 
PRO.1.24	Because I called out and you refused me, 
PRO.1.24	I stretched out my hand, yet there is none who heeds. 
PRO.1.25	You have ignored all my counsel, 
PRO.1.25	and my reproof you are not willing to accept. 
PRO.1.26	I will also laugh at your calamity;
PRO.1.26	I will mock when panic
PRO.1.27	When your panic comes like a storm, 
PRO.1.27	and your calamity arrives like a whirlwind, 
PRO.1.27	when distress and anguish come upon you, 
PRO.1.28	then they will call
PRO.1.28	they will seek me diligently but not find me. 
PRO.1.29	Since they hated knowledge, 
PRO.1.29	and did not choose the fear of Yahweh, 
PRO.1.30	they were not willing to accept my counsel, 
PRO.1.30	they despised all my reproof. 
PRO.1.31	They shall eat from the fruit of their way, 
PRO.1.31	and they shall be sated from their own schemes, 
PRO.1.32	for the waywardness of the simple ones will kill them, 
PRO.1.32	and the complacency of fools will destroy them. 
PRO.1.33	Whoever listens to me will dwell in security 
PRO.1.33	and rest securely
PRO.2.1	My child, if you will receive
PRO.2.1	and hide my commands with you, 
PRO.2.2	in order to incline your ear toward wisdom, 
PRO.2.2	then you shall apply your heart to understanding. 
PRO.2.3	For if you cry out for understanding,
PRO.2.3	if you lift
PRO.2.4	if you seek her like silver 
PRO.2.4	and search her out like treasure,
PRO.2.5	then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, 
PRO.2.5	and the knowledge of God you will find. 
PRO.2.6	For Yahweh will give wisdom; 
PRO.2.6	from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 
PRO.2.7	For the upright, he stores
PRO.2.8	in order to guard paths of justice 
PRO.2.8	and keep
PRO.2.9	Then you will understand righteousness and justice 
PRO.2.9	and uprightness—every good course— 
PRO.2.10	for wisdom will enter your heart, 
PRO.2.10	and knowledge will be pleasing to your soul.
PRO.2.11	Discretion will watch over you; 
PRO.2.11	understanding will protect you, 
PRO.2.12	in order to deliver you from the way of evil,
PRO.2.12	from a man who speaks devious things— 
PRO.2.13	those who forsake the paths of uprightness 
PRO.2.13	to walk in ways of darkness, 
PRO.2.14	those who are happy to do evil, 
PRO.2.14	for they delight in the deviousness of evil, 
PRO.2.15	who are crooked in their ways,
PRO.2.15	and devious in their paths; 
PRO.2.16	in order to deliver you from a strange woman, 
PRO.2.16	from a foreign woman who flatters
PRO.2.17	she who forsakes the partner of her youth 
PRO.2.17	and has forgotten the covenant of her God, 
PRO.2.18	for her house sinks to death, 
PRO.2.18	and to the dead
PRO.2.19	Of all who go to her, none shall return, 
PRO.2.19	nor do they reach paths of life. 
PRO.2.20	So that you will walk on the road of those who are good, 
PRO.2.20	and the paths of those who are righteous you shall keep. 
PRO.2.21	For those who are upright will dwell in the land,
PRO.2.21	and those who are blameless
PRO.2.22	And those who are wicked will be cut off from the land, 
PRO.2.22	and those who are treacherous will be uprooted from it. 
PRO.3.1	My child, do not forget my instruction, 
PRO.3.1	and may your heart guard my commands. 
PRO.3.2	For length of days, years of life, 
PRO.3.2	and peace they
PRO.3.3	May loyal love
PRO.3.3	bind them around your neck, 
PRO.3.3	write them upon your heart. 
PRO.3.4	And you shall find favor and good sense
PRO.3.4	in the eyes of God and humankind. 
PRO.3.5	Trust Yahweh
PRO.3.5	do not lean toward your own understanding. 
PRO.3.6	In all your ways acknowledge him, 
PRO.3.6	and he will straighten your paths. 
PRO.3.7	Do not be wise in your own eyes; 
PRO.3.7	fear Yahweh and retreat from evil. 
PRO.3.8	There shall be healing for your flesh,
PRO.3.8	and refreshment for your body.

PRO.3.9	and from the firstfruits of all that will come to you, 
PRO.3.10	and your barns shall be full of plenty, 
PRO.3.10	and your vats shall burst with new wine. 
PRO.3.11	Do not despise the discipline of Yahweh, my child. 
PRO.3.11	Do not be weary of his reproof 
PRO.3.12	because whomever Yahweh will love, he will rebuke, 
PRO.3.12	as a father delights in his son. 
PRO.3.13	Happy is the one
PRO.3.13	and one who obtains understanding. 
PRO.3.14	For her
PRO.3.14	and her revenue than that of gold. 
PRO.3.15	She is more precious than rubies, 
PRO.3.15	and all your desires shall not compare with her. 
PRO.3.16	Length of days is in her right hand; 
PRO.3.16	in her left hand are riches and honor. 
PRO.3.17	Her ways are ways of pleasantness, 
PRO.3.17	and all her paths are peace. 
PRO.3.18	She is a tree of life for those who seize her; 
PRO.3.18	those who take hold of her are considered happy. 
PRO.3.19	Yahweh in wisdom founded the earth; 
PRO.3.19	he established the heavens in understanding. 
PRO.3.20	With his knowledge, depths broke open, 
PRO.3.20	and clouds dropped dew. 
PRO.3.21	My child, may they
PRO.3.21	may you keep sound wisdom and prudence. 
PRO.3.22	They shall be life for your soul
PRO.3.22	and adornment
PRO.3.23	Then you will walk in the confidence of your ways, 
PRO.3.23	and your foot will not stumble. 
PRO.3.24	If you sit down, you will not panic,
PRO.3.24	and if you lie down, then your sleep shall be sweet. 
PRO.3.25	Do not be afraid of sudden panic,
PRO.3.25	or the storm of wickedness that will come. 
PRO.3.26	Yahweh will be your confidence
PRO.3.26	and guard your foot from capture. 
PRO.3.27	Do not withhold good from its owner
PRO.3.27	when it is in the power of your hand to do. 
PRO.3.28	Do not say to your neighbor, 
PRO.3.28	“Go and return and tomorrow I will give it,” 
PRO.3.28	when it is with you.
PRO.3.29	Do not plot harm against your neighbor 
PRO.3.29	who dwells in confidence beside you. 
PRO.3.30	Do not quarrel with anyone without cause, 
PRO.3.30	when he did not do you harm. 
PRO.3.31	Do not envy a man of violence, 
PRO.3.31	and do not choose any of his ways, 
PRO.3.32	for he who is perverse is an abomination of Yahweh, 
PRO.3.32	but those who are upright are his confidence. 
PRO.3.33	The curse of Yahweh is on the house of the wicked, 
PRO.3.33	and the abode of the righteous ones he blesses. 
PRO.3.34	With those who scorn, he is scornful, 
PRO.3.34	but to those who are humble, he gives favor. 
PRO.3.35	They will inherit the honor of the wise, 
PRO.3.35	but stubborn fools, disgrace. 
PRO.4.1	Children, listen to the instruction of a father, 
PRO.4.1	and be attentive in order to know insight. 
PRO.4.2	For I have given you good instruction; 
PRO.4.2	do not forsake my teaching. 
PRO.4.3	When I was a son to my father, 
PRO.4.3	tender and alone before my mother, 
PRO.4.4	he taught me and said to me, 
PRO.4.4	“May your heart hold fast to my words; 
PRO.4.4	guard my commandments and live. 
PRO.4.5	Get wisdom and insight; 
PRO.4.5	do not forget and do not turn from the sayings of my mouth. 
PRO.4.6	Do not forsake her—then she will guard you; 
PRO.4.6	love her and she will keep you. 
PRO.4.7	The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! 
PRO.4.7	With all that is in your possession, gain insight. 
PRO.4.8	Cherish her and she will exalt you; 
PRO.4.8	she will honor you if you embrace her. 
PRO.4.9	She will give a garland for your head; 
PRO.4.9	she shall bestow a crown of glory upon you.” 
PRO.4.10	Listen, my child, take my sayings, 
PRO.4.10	and the years of your life shall be great. 
PRO.4.11	In the way of wisdom I have instructed you; 
PRO.4.11	I have led you in the path of uprightness. 
PRO.4.12	When you walk,
PRO.4.12	and if you run, you will not stumble. 
PRO.4.13	Seize the instruction! Do not let go! 
PRO.4.13	Guard her, for she is your life. 
PRO.4.14	In the path of the wicked do not go; 
PRO.4.14	do not walk in the way of those who do evil. 
PRO.4.15	Avoid it; do not transgress it; 
PRO.4.15	turn away from it and pass by. 
PRO.4.16	For they will not sleep if they have not done wrong, 
PRO.4.16	and they are robbed of their sleep if they do not cause stumbling. 
PRO.4.17	For they ate the bread of wickedness, 
PRO.4.17	and they drank the wine of violence. 
PRO.4.18	But the path of the righteous ones is like the light of dawn, 
PRO.4.18	leading and shining until the day is full.
PRO.4.19	The way of the wicked ones is like deep darkness; 
PRO.4.19	they do not know what they stumble over. 
PRO.4.20	My child, be attentive to my words; 
PRO.4.20	to my sayings incline your ear. 
PRO.4.21	May they not escape from your sight;
PRO.4.21	keep them in the midst of your heart. 
PRO.4.22	For they are life to those who find them 
PRO.4.22	and healing to the entire body.
PRO.4.23	With all vigilance, keep your heart, 
PRO.4.23	for from it comes the source
PRO.4.24	Remove from yourself deceitful speech,
PRO.4.24	and abolish devious talk
PRO.4.25	May your eyes look forward
PRO.4.25	and your gaze be straight before you. 
PRO.4.26	May the path of your foot be balanced 
PRO.4.26	and all your ways be sure. 
PRO.4.27	Do not swerve right or left; 
PRO.4.27	remove your foot from evil. 
PRO.5.1	 My child, be attentive to my wisdom, 
PRO.5.1	and to my understanding incline your ear; 
PRO.5.2	in order to keep prudence, 
PRO.5.2	and knowledge will guard your lips. 
PRO.5.3	For the lips of the strange woman will drip honey, 
PRO.5.3	and smoother than oil is her mouth.
PRO.5.4	But her end is bitter as the wormwood, 
PRO.5.4	sharp as a two-edged sword. 
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death; 
PRO.5.5	her steps take hold of Sheol.
PRO.5.6	She does not observe
PRO.5.6	her ways wander, and she does not know it. 
PRO.5.7	Now, O children, listen to me; 
PRO.5.7	do not depart from the sayings of my mouth. 
PRO.5.8	Keep your paths far from her, 
PRO.5.8	and do not go near to the door of her house, 
PRO.5.9	lest you give your honor to the others, 
PRO.5.9	and your years to the merciless, 
PRO.5.10	lest strangers take their fill of your strength, 
PRO.5.10	and your labors go to the house of a foreigner, 
PRO.5.11	and you groan at your end, 
PRO.5.11	when your flesh and body are consumed, 
PRO.5.12	and say “How I hated discipline, 
PRO.5.12	and I despised reproof!” 
PRO.5.13	and “I did not listen to the voice of my teachers, 
PRO.5.13	and I did not incline my ear to my instructors! 
PRO.5.14	I was almost at utter
PRO.5.14	in the midst of the assembly and congregation.” 
PRO.5.15	Drink water from your own cistern 
PRO.5.15	and flowing waters from inside your own well. 
PRO.5.16	Shall your springs be scattered outward? 
PRO.5.16	In the streets, shall there be streams of water? 
PRO.5.17	May they be yours alone, 
PRO.5.17	and not for strangers who are with you. 
PRO.5.18	May your fountain be blessed, 
PRO.5.18	and rejoice in the wife
PRO.5.19	She is a deer of love and a doe of grace; 
PRO.5.19	may her breasts satisfy you always;
PRO.5.19	by her love may you be intoxicated continually. 
PRO.5.20	Why should you be intoxicated, my child, by a strange woman, 
PRO.5.20	and embrace the bosom of a foreigner? 
PRO.5.21	For before the eyes of Yahweh are human ways,
PRO.5.21	and all his paths he examines. 
PRO.5.22	His iniquities shall ensnare him, the evildoer, 
PRO.5.22	and in the vanity of his sin he shall be caught. 
PRO.5.23	He shall die for lack of
PRO.5.23	and in the greatness of his folly he shall be lost. 
PRO.6.1	My child, if you have pledged to your neighbor, 
PRO.6.1	if you have bound yourself
PRO.6.2	if you are snared by the sayings of your mouth, 
PRO.6.2	if you are caught by the sayings of your mouth, 
PRO.6.3	do this, then, my child, and save yourself, 
PRO.6.3	for you have come into the palm of your neighbor’s hand:
PRO.6.3	Go, humble yourself, plead with your neighbor. 
PRO.6.4	Do not give sleep to your eyes, 
PRO.6.4	or slumber to your eyelids. 
PRO.6.5	Save yourself like a gazelle from a hand, 
PRO.6.5	or like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 
PRO.6.6	Go to the ant, lazy! 
PRO.6.6	Consider its ways and be wise. 
PRO.6.7	It has no chief, 
PRO.6.7	officer, or ruler. 
PRO.6.8	In the summer, it prepares its food; 
PRO.6.8	in the harvest, it gathers its sustenance. 
PRO.6.9	How long will you lie down, lazy? 
PRO.6.9	When will you rise up from your sleep? 
PRO.6.10	A little sleep, a little slumber, 
PRO.6.10	a little folding of the hands for rest— 
PRO.6.11	like a robber
PRO.6.11	and what you lack like an armed man. 
PRO.6.12	A worthless man, an evil man, 
PRO.6.12	goes around with deceitful speech.
PRO.6.13	Winking in his eye, shuffling in his foot, 
PRO.6.13	pointing in his fingers, 
PRO.6.14	perversion in his heart, he devises evil; 
PRO.6.14	at all times he will send out discord.
PRO.6.15	Upon such a man,
PRO.6.15	in a moment he will be damaged and there is no healing.
PRO.6.16	There are six things Yahweh hates, 
PRO.6.16	and seven things are abominations of his soul:
PRO.6.17	haughty eyes, a lying tongue, 
PRO.6.17	and hands that shed innocent blood, 
PRO.6.18	a devising heart, plans of deception, 
PRO.6.18	feet that hurry to run to evil,
PRO.6.19	a false witness who breathes lies 
PRO.6.19	and sends out discord
PRO.6.20	My child, keep the commandment of your father, 
PRO.6.20	and do not disregard the instruction of your mother. 
PRO.6.21	Bind them on your heart continually; 
PRO.6.21	tie them upon your neck. 
PRO.6.22	When you walk,
PRO.6.22	When you lie down,
PRO.6.22	and when you awake, she will converse with you. 
PRO.6.23	For like a lamp is a commandment, and instruction is light, 
PRO.6.23	and the way of life
PRO.6.24	in order to preserve you from an evil woman,
PRO.6.24	from the smoothness of the tongue of an adulteress.
PRO.6.25	Do not desire her beauty in your heart; 
PRO.6.25	may she not capture you with her eyelashes. 
PRO.6.26	For the price of a woman, a prostitute,
PRO.6.26	but the woman belonging to a man
PRO.6.27	Can a man carry fire in his lap, 
PRO.6.27	and his clothes not burn? 
PRO.6.28	If a man walks upon the hot coals, 
PRO.6.28	will his feet not be burned? 
PRO.6.29	Thus, he who goes to the wife of his neighbor, 
PRO.6.29	any who touches her shall not go unpunished. 
PRO.6.30	People do not despise a thief when he steals 
PRO.6.30	to fill himself
PRO.6.31	But if he is found, he will pay sevenfold, 
PRO.6.31	every possession of his house he shall give. 
PRO.6.32	He who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense,
PRO.6.32	he destroys himself
PRO.6.33	A wound and dishonor he will find, 
PRO.6.33	and his disgrace will not be wiped out. 
PRO.6.34	For jealousy is the fury of a husband, 
PRO.6.34	and he will not show restraint on the day of revenge. 
PRO.6.35	He will not accept any compensation,
PRO.6.35	and he will not be willing, though the bribe is large. 
PRO.7.1	My child, guard my sayings; 
PRO.7.1	store my commandments with you. 
PRO.7.2	Keep my commands and live, 
PRO.7.2	and my teaching like the apple of your eye.
PRO.7.3	Bind them on your fingers; 
PRO.7.3	write them on the tablet of your heart. 
PRO.7.4	Say to wisdom,
PRO.7.4	and you shall call insight,
PRO.7.5	In order to guard yourself from an adulteress,
PRO.7.5	from the foreigner who makes her words smooth.
PRO.7.6	For at the window of my house, 
PRO.7.6	through my lattice, I looked down. 
PRO.7.7	And I saw among the simple, 
PRO.7.7	I observed among the youth, 
PRO.7.7	a young man lacking sense,
PRO.7.8	passing on the street at
PRO.7.8	and he takes the road to her house, 
PRO.7.9	at twilight, at the day’s evening, 
PRO.7.9	in the midst of night and the darkness. 
PRO.7.10	Then behold! A woman comes to meet him 
PRO.7.10	with the garment of a prostitute
PRO.7.11	She is loud and stubborn; 
PRO.7.11	her feet do not stay at her house. 
PRO.7.12	Now in the street, now in the square, 
PRO.7.12	at
PRO.7.13	She took hold of 
PRO.7.13	Her face was impudent, and she said to him, 
PRO.7.14	“Sacrifices of peace offerings are upon me; 
PRO.7.14	today
PRO.7.15	So
PRO.7.15	to seek your face, and I have found you. 
PRO.7.16	With coverings I have adorned my couch, 
PRO.7.16	spreads of the linen of Egypt; 
PRO.7.17	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, 
PRO.7.17	aloes, and cinnamon. 
PRO.7.18	Come, let us take our fill of love making, 
PRO.7.18	until the morning let us delight in love. 
PRO.7.19	For there is no man
PRO.7.19	he has gone on a long journey.
PRO.7.20	The bag of money he took in his hand, 
PRO.7.20	for on the day of the full moon he will come home.” 
PRO.7.21	She persuades him with the greatness of her teachings; 
PRO.7.21	with her smooth lips she compels him. 
PRO.7.22	He goes after her suddenly; 
PRO.7.22	like an ox to the slaughter he goes, 
PRO.7.22	and like a stag to the instruction of a fool, 
PRO.7.23	until an arrow pierces his entrails,
PRO.7.23	like a bird rushing into a snare, 
PRO.7.23	but he does not know that it will cost him his life.
PRO.7.24	And now, my children, listen to me, 
PRO.7.24	and be attentive to the sayings of my mouth. 
PRO.7.25	May your heart not turn aside to her ways; 
PRO.7.25	do not stray into her path. 
PRO.7.26	For many slain she has laid low, 
PRO.7.26	and countless
PRO.7.27	The ways of Sheol
PRO.7.27	descending to chambers of death. 
PRO.8.1	Does not wisdom call, 
PRO.8.1	and understanding raise its voice? 
PRO.8.2	Atop the heights
PRO.8.2	at the crossroads she stands. 
PRO.8.3	Beside gates, before towns, 
PRO.8.3	at the entrance of doors, she cries out: 
PRO.8.4	“To you, O people,
PRO.8.4	and my cry is to the children of humankind. 
PRO.8.5	Learn prudence, O simple ones; 
PRO.8.5	fools, learn intelligence.
PRO.8.6	Listen! For noble things I will speak, 
PRO.8.6	and upright things from the opening of my lips. 
PRO.8.7	My mouth will utter truth, 
PRO.8.7	and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 
PRO.8.8	All sayings of my mouth are in righteousness; 
PRO.8.8	none of them are twisted and crooked. 
PRO.8.9	All of them are straight to him who understands, 
PRO.8.9	and upright to those who find knowledge. 
PRO.8.10	Take my teaching and not silver; 
PRO.8.10	may you choose knowledge rather than choice gold. 
PRO.8.11	For wisdom is better than jewels, 
PRO.8.11	and all desires shall not compare with her. 
PRO.8.12	I, wisdom, live with prudence, 
PRO.8.12	and I find knowledge and discretion. 
PRO.8.13	The fear of Yahweh is hatred of evil, 
PRO.8.13	pride, and arrogance and an evil way. 
PRO.8.13	And I hate a mouth of perversity. 
PRO.8.14	Advice and sound judgment
PRO.8.14	I am understanding, strength is mine.
PRO.8.15	By me kings reign, 
PRO.8.15	and rulers decree righteousness. 
PRO.8.16	By me rulers rule, 
PRO.8.16	and nobles—all judges of righteousness. 
PRO.8.17	I love those who love me,
PRO.8.17	and those who seek me diligently shall find me. 
PRO.8.18	Fortune and glory are with me, 
PRO.8.18	enduring wealth and righteousness. 
PRO.8.19	My fruit is better than gold,
PRO.8.19	and my yield than choice silver. 
PRO.8.20	In the way of righteousness I walk, 
PRO.8.20	in the midst of paths of justice, 
PRO.8.21	in order to endow those who love me with wealth, 
PRO.8.21	and I will fill their treasuries. 
PRO.8.22	“Yahweh possessed
PRO.8.22	before his acts of old.
PRO.8.23	From eternity, I was set up from the first, 
PRO.8.23	from the beginning
PRO.8.24	When there were no depths, I was brought forth, 
PRO.8.24	when there were no springs of abounding
PRO.8.25	Before mountains had been shaped, 
PRO.8.25	before hills, I was brought forth. 
PRO.8.26	When he had not yet made earth and fields, 
PRO.8.26	or the first dust of the world, 
PRO.8.27	when he established
PRO.8.27	when he drew
PRO.8.28	when he made
PRO.8.28	when he founded fountains of the deep, 
PRO.8.29	when he assigned
PRO.8.29	that waters shall not transgress his command,
PRO.8.29	when he marked
PRO.8.30	I was beside
PRO.8.30	and I was delighting day by day, 
PRO.8.30	rejoicing before him always,
PRO.8.31	rejoicing in the world of his earth, 
PRO.8.31	and my delight was with the children of humankind. 
PRO.8.32	“And now, children, listen to me; 
PRO.8.32	happy are those who will keep my ways. 
PRO.8.33	Hear teaching and be wise; 
PRO.8.33	do not neglect it. 
PRO.8.34	Happy is the person who listens to me, 
PRO.8.34	in order to keep watch at my doors day by day, 
PRO.8.34	in order to guard the frames of my entrances. 
PRO.8.35	For he who finds me is he who finds
PRO.8.35	and he obtains favor from Yahweh. 
PRO.8.36	But he who misses me injures himself.
PRO.8.36	All those who hate me love death.” 
PRO.9.1	Wisdom has built her house; 
PRO.9.1	she has hewn her seven pillars. 
PRO.9.2	She has slaughtered her slaughtering, mixed her wine, 
PRO.9.2	and also set her table. 
PRO.9.3	She has sent her servant girls,
PRO.9.3	upon the wings of the high places of town, 
PRO.9.4	“Whoever is simple, let him turn here.” 
PRO.9.4	As for the one who lacks sense,
PRO.9.5	“Come, eat with my bread; 
PRO.9.5	drink with the wine I have mixed. 
PRO.9.6	Lay aside simplicity and live; 
PRO.9.6	walk in the way of understanding.” 
PRO.9.7	He who corrects a scoffer gains abuse for himself, 
PRO.9.7	and he who rebukes the wicked gets hurt.
PRO.9.8	Do not rebuke a scoffer, lest he hate you; 
PRO.9.8	rebuke the wise and he will love you. 
PRO.9.9	Give to a wise one and he will become more wise; 
PRO.9.9	teach
PRO.9.10	The start of wisdom is fear of Yahweh, 
PRO.9.10	and knowledge of the Holy One,
PRO.9.11	For by me your days shall increase, 
PRO.9.11	and years of life shall multiply for you. 
PRO.9.12	If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, 
PRO.9.12	and if you scoff, alone you shall bear it. 
PRO.9.13	A woman of foolishness is loud, 
PRO.9.13	simple, and does not know it.
PRO.9.14	She sits at the door of her house, 
PRO.9.14	upon a throne at the high places of town, 
PRO.9.15	in order to call to those who pass by the road, 
PRO.9.15	those who go straight on their way: 
PRO.9.16	“Whoever is simple, may he turn here!” 
PRO.9.16	As for he who lacks sense,
PRO.9.17	“Stolen waters are sweet, 
PRO.9.17	and bread of secrecy is pleasant.” 
PRO.9.18	But he does not know that the dead
PRO.9.18	in the depths of Sheol
PRO.10.1	The proverbs of Solomon: 
PRO.10.1	A wise child makes a father glad, 
PRO.10.1	but a foolish child grieves his mother. 
PRO.10.2	Treasures of wickedness do not profit, 
PRO.10.2	but righteousness delivers from death. 
PRO.10.3	Yahweh will not cause a righteous person
PRO.10.3	but the craving of the wicked he will thwart. 
PRO.10.4	A slack hand causes poverty, 
PRO.10.4	but the hand of the diligent enriches. 
PRO.10.5	He who gathers in the summer is a child who is prudent; 
PRO.10.5	he who sleeps at the harvest is a child who brings shame. 
PRO.10.6	Blessings belong to the head of the righteous, 
PRO.10.6	but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 
PRO.10.7	The memory of righteousness is like a blessing, 
PRO.10.7	but the name of the wicked will rot. 
PRO.10.8	A heart of wisdom will heed commandments, 
PRO.10.8	but a babbling fool will come to ruin. 
PRO.10.9	Whoever walks in integrity
PRO.10.9	but whoever follows perversity, his ways will be made known. 
PRO.10.10	The winking of an eye causes
PRO.10.10	and the foolishness of lips comes to ruin. 
PRO.10.11	A fountain of life is a mouth of righteousness, 
PRO.10.11	and a mouth of wickedness conceals violence. 
PRO.10.12	Hatred stirs up strife, 
PRO.10.12	but love covers over all offenses. 
PRO.10.13	On the lips of one who has understanding, wisdom is found, 
PRO.10.13	but a rod is for the back of one who lacks sense.
PRO.10.14	Those who are wise lay up knowledge, 
PRO.10.14	but to the mouth of the fool, ruin draws near. 
PRO.10.15	The wealth of the rich is the city of his strength; 
PRO.10.15	the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 
PRO.10.16	The wage of the righteous leads to life; 
PRO.10.16	the gain of the wicked to sin. 
PRO.10.17	On the path to life is he who guards instruction, 
PRO.10.17	but he who rejects rebuke goes astray. 
PRO.10.18	He who conceals hatred has lips of deceit, 
PRO.10.18	and he who utters slander—he is a fool. 
PRO.10.19	In many words, transgression is not lacking, 
PRO.10.19	but he who restrains his lips is prudent. 
PRO.10.20	Choice silver is a tongue of righteousness, 
PRO.10.20	a heart
PRO.10.21	Lips of righteousness feed many, 
PRO.10.21	but fools die for lack of sense.
PRO.10.22	The blessing of Yahweh makes one rich, 
PRO.10.22	and he does not increase sorrow with it. 
PRO.10.23	It is like a sport for a fool to do wrong, 
PRO.10.23	wisdom for a person of understanding. 
PRO.10.24	The dread of the wicked will come upon him, 
PRO.10.24	but the desire of the righteous will be granted. 
PRO.10.25	With the passing of the tempest, there is no wickedness, 
PRO.10.25	but the righteous have a foundation forever. 
PRO.10.26	Like vinegar to the tooth and like smoke to the eyes, 
PRO.10.26	thus is the lazy to one who employs
PRO.10.27	The fear of Yahweh adds life, 
PRO.10.27	but the years of the wicked are shortened. 
PRO.10.28	The hope of the righteous is gladness, 
PRO.10.28	but the expectation of the wicked comes to nothing. 
PRO.10.29	A stronghold for the upright is the way of Yahweh, 
PRO.10.29	but ruin belongs to evildoers.
PRO.10.30	The righteous one is forever; he will not be removed. 
PRO.10.30	But the wicked will not remain in the land.
PRO.10.31	The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom, 
PRO.10.31	but a tongue of perversity will be cut off. 
PRO.10.32	The lips of the righteous know the acceptable, 
PRO.10.32	but the mouth of the wicked, the perverse. 
PRO.11.1	 Balances of deceit are an abomination of Yahweh, 
PRO.11.1	but an accurate weight
PRO.11.2	Pride comes, then disgrace comes, 
PRO.11.2	but wisdom is with the humble. 
PRO.11.3	The integrity of the upright guides them, 
PRO.11.3	but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them. 
PRO.11.4	Wealth does not profit on the day of wrath, 
PRO.11.4	but righteousness will deliver from death. 
PRO.11.5	The righteousness of the blameless will keep his ways straight, 
PRO.11.5	but the wicked will fall by his wickedness. 
PRO.11.6	The righteousness of the upright will save them, 
PRO.11.6	but by a scheme the treacherous will be taken captive. 
PRO.11.7	With the death of a wicked person, hope will die, 
PRO.11.7	and the expectation of the godless perishes. 
PRO.11.8	The righteous is delivered from trouble, 
PRO.11.8	but the wicked enters into it. 
PRO.11.9	With a mouth, the godless shall destroy his neighbor, 
PRO.11.9	but by knowledge the righteous are delivered. 
PRO.11.10	When good is with the righteous, the city rejoices, 
PRO.11.10	and with the perishing of the wicked, jubilation. 
PRO.11.11	By the blessing of the upright, a city will be exalted, 
PRO.11.11	but by the mouth of the wicked, it will be overthrown. 
PRO.11.12	He who lacks sense
PRO.11.12	but a person of intelligence will remain silent. 
PRO.11.13	A gossip walks about telling a secret, 
PRO.11.13	but the trustworthy in spirit keeps the matter. 
PRO.11.14	Where there is no guidance, a nation
PRO.11.14	but there is safety in an abundance of counsel. 
PRO.11.15	He will suffer trouble when he loans to a stranger, 
PRO.11.15	but he who refuses a pledge is safe. 
PRO.11.16	A woman of grace receives honor, 
PRO.11.16	but the ruthless gets wealth. 
PRO.11.17	A person of kindness rewards himself,
PRO.11.17	but a cruel person harms his own flesh. 
PRO.11.18	The wicked earns
PRO.11.18	but he who sows righteousness, a true reward.
PRO.11.19	He who is steadfast in righteousness is to life 
PRO.11.19	as
PRO.11.20	An abomination of Yahweh are the crooked of heart,
PRO.11.20	but his delight are those with blameless ways.
PRO.11.21	Rest assured,
PRO.11.21	but the offspring
PRO.11.22	A ring of gold in the snout of a pig 
PRO.11.22	is a woman who is beautiful but without discretion. 
PRO.11.23	The desire of the righteous is only good, 
PRO.11.23	but the expectation of the wicked, wrath. 
PRO.11.24	There is one who gives yet grows richer,
PRO.11.24	but he who withholds what is right
PRO.11.25	A person of blessing will be enriched, 
PRO.11.25	and he who gives water also will be refreshed. 
PRO.11.26	He who withholds grain, the people curse him, 
PRO.11.26	but a blessing is for the head of him who sells. 
PRO.11.27	He who diligently seeks good seeks favor, 
PRO.11.27	but he who inquires of evil, it will come to him. 
PRO.11.28	He who trusts in his wealth is he who will fall, 
PRO.11.28	but like a green leaf the righteous will flourish. 
PRO.11.29	He who brings trouble to his household, he will inherit wind,
PRO.11.29	and a fool will serve the wise of heart. 
PRO.11.30	The fruit of righteousness is a tree of life, 
PRO.11.30	and he who captures souls
PRO.11.31	If the righteous on earth will be repaid, 
PRO.11.31	how much more
PRO.12.1	 He who loves discipline loves knowledge, 
PRO.12.1	but he who hates rebuke is stupid. 
PRO.12.2	The good obtains favor from Yahweh, 
PRO.12.2	but anyone who schemes, he condemns. 
PRO.12.3	A person will not be established by wickedness, 
PRO.12.3	but the root of the righteous will not be moved. 
PRO.12.4	A woman of strength
PRO.12.4	but like rot in his bones is she who brings shame. 
PRO.12.5	The thoughts of the righteous are
PRO.12.5	the advice of the wicked is treacherous. 
PRO.12.6	The words of the wicked are an ambush of blood, 
PRO.12.6	but the mouth of the upright delivers them. 
PRO.12.7	The wicked are overthrown and are no more,
PRO.12.7	but the house of the righteous shall stand. 
PRO.12.8	For his mouth of good sense, a man will be recommended, 
PRO.12.8	but he who is of perverse mind
PRO.12.9	It is better to be lowly and a servant to someone
PRO.12.9	than self-glorifying and lacking food. 
PRO.12.10	The righteous knows the life
PRO.12.10	but the compassion
PRO.12.11	He who works his land will have plenty of food, 
PRO.12.11	but he who follows worthless things lacks sense.
PRO.12.12	The wicked covets the proceeds of evil, 
PRO.12.12	but the root of the righteous bears fruit.
PRO.12.13	By the transgression of lips, evil is ensnared, 
PRO.12.13	but the righteous escapes from trouble. 
PRO.12.14	From the fruit of the mouth of a man, he is filled with good, 
PRO.12.14	and the reward of a man’s labor
PRO.12.15	The way of a fool is upright in his own eyes, 
PRO.12.15	but he who listens to advice is wise. 
PRO.12.16	As for a fool, on that very day
PRO.12.16	but he who ignores an insult is prudent. 
PRO.12.17	He who will speak truth will reveal righteousness, 
PRO.12.17	but the witness of falsehood, deceit. 
PRO.12.18	There is one who speaks rashly, like the thrust of a sword, 
PRO.12.18	but the tongue of the wise brings healing. 
PRO.12.19	A lip of truth endures forever, 
PRO.12.19	but a tongue of deception lasts only a moment. 
PRO.12.20	Deceit is in the heart
PRO.12.20	but to those who plan
PRO.12.21	No evil will happen
PRO.12.21	but the wicked are filled with trouble. 
PRO.12.22	An abomination of Yahweh are lips of deceit, 
PRO.12.22	but they who act faithfully are his delight. 
PRO.12.23	A clever person conceals knowledge, 
PRO.12.23	but the heart
PRO.12.24	The hand of the diligent ones will rule, 
PRO.12.24	but the lazy will belong to forced labor. 
PRO.12.25	Anxiety in the heart
PRO.12.25	but a good word will cheer him. 
PRO.12.26	A righteous person will seek out his neighbor, 
PRO.12.26	but the way of the wicked will lead them astray. 
PRO.12.27	The lazy will not roast his game, 
PRO.12.27	but diligence is the precious wealth of a man. 
PRO.12.28	On the road of righteousness is life, 
PRO.12.28	and on the way of the path, may there be no death. 
PRO.13.1	 A wise child hears the discipline of a father, 
PRO.13.1	but a scoffer does not listen to a rebuke. 
PRO.13.2	From the fruit of the mouth of a man, he shall eat what is good, 
PRO.13.2	but the desire
PRO.13.3	He who keeps his mouth guards his life;
PRO.13.3	he who opens his lips, ruin belongs to him. 
PRO.13.4	The soul
PRO.13.4	but the person of diligence is richly supplied. 
PRO.13.5	The righteous hates a word of falsehood; 
PRO.13.5	the wicked will bring shame and disgrace.
PRO.13.6	Righteousness will guard the upright of way, 
PRO.13.6	but wickedness will overthrow sin. 
PRO.13.7	There is one who acts rich but has nothing;
PRO.13.7	another who pretends to be poor but has wealth. 
PRO.13.8	The ransom of the life of a man is his wealth, 
PRO.13.8	but the poor does not receive a threat. 
PRO.13.9	The light of the righteous will rejoice, 
PRO.13.9	but the lamp of the wicked will die out. 
PRO.13.10	Only by insolence is strife set up, 
PRO.13.10	and wisdom is with those who take advice. 
PRO.13.11	Wealth gained from haste
PRO.13.11	but he who gathers little by little
PRO.13.12	Hope that is deferred makes the heart
PRO.13.12	but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life. 
PRO.13.13	He who despises a word will bring destruction on himself, 
PRO.13.13	but he who respects a commandment will be rewarded. 
PRO.13.14	The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, 
PRO.13.14	in order to avoid the snares of death. 
PRO.13.15	Good sense grants favor, 
PRO.13.15	but the way of the faithless is coarse. 
PRO.13.16	Anyone who is clever will act with intelligence, 
PRO.13.16	but the fool will display folly. 
PRO.13.17	A messenger of wickedness will fall into trouble, 
PRO.13.17	but an envoy of the faithful brings healing. 
PRO.13.18	Poverty and disgrace belong to him who ignores instruction, 
PRO.13.18	but he who guards reproof will be honored. 
PRO.13.19	A desire fulfilled
PRO.13.19	but an abomination of fools is turning from evil. 
PRO.13.20	Walk with the wise and be wise, 
PRO.13.20	but as for the companion of fools, he will suffer harm. 
PRO.13.21	Misfortune will pursue sinners, 
PRO.13.21	but the righteous will be rewarded with prosperity.
PRO.13.22	He who is good will leave an inheritance to his grandchildren,
PRO.13.22	and stored up for the righteous is the wealth of a sinner. 
PRO.13.23	There is much food in the field of the poor, 
PRO.13.23	but it is swept away
PRO.13.24	He who withholds his rod hates his child, 
PRO.13.24	but he who loves him gives him
PRO.13.25	The righteous eats to satisfy his life,
PRO.13.25	but the belly of the wicked will lack. 
PRO.14.1	 The wisest of women
PRO.14.1	but the foolish tears it down with her hands. 
PRO.14.2	He who walks in uprightness fears Yahweh, 
PRO.14.2	but he who is devious in his ways displeases him. 
PRO.14.3	In the mouth of a fool is the rod of pride, 
PRO.14.3	but the lips of the wise preserve them. 
PRO.14.4	When there are no
PRO.14.4	but an abundance of crops comes by the strength of an ox.
PRO.14.5	A faithful witness does not lie, 
PRO.14.5	but he who breathes out falsehood is a witness of deceit. 
PRO.14.6	A scoffer seeks wisdom, but there is none, 
PRO.14.6	but knowledge comes easily to him who understands.
PRO.14.7	Leave the presence of a foolish man,
PRO.14.7	for you will not come to know words of knowledge.
PRO.14.8	The wisdom of the clever is understanding his ways, 
PRO.14.8	but the folly of fools is deceit. 
PRO.14.9	Fools mock
PRO.14.9	but among the upright, it is favorable. 
PRO.14.10	The heart
PRO.14.10	but in its joy, it will not share itself with a stranger. 
PRO.14.11	The house of the wicked will be destroyed, 
PRO.14.11	but the tent of the upright will flourish. 
PRO.14.12	There is a way that seems upright to
PRO.14.12	but its end is the way of death. 
PRO.14.13	Even in laughter, a heart may be sad, 
PRO.14.13	and the end of joy may be grief. 
PRO.14.14	From his ways, the perverse of heart will be satisfied, 
PRO.14.14	and from his own,
PRO.14.15	The simple will believe every word, 
PRO.14.15	but the clever will consider his step. 
PRO.14.16	The wise is cautious and turns from evil, 
PRO.14.16	but the fool throws off restraint and is confident. 
PRO.14.17	He who is short of temper
PRO.14.17	and the man who schemes will be hated. 
PRO.14.18	The simple are adorned with folly, 
PRO.14.18	but the clever are crowned with knowledge. 
PRO.14.19	The evil bow down before the good, 
PRO.14.19	and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. 
PRO.14.20	The poor is disliked even by his neighbor, 
PRO.14.20	but the lovers of the rich are many. 
PRO.14.21	He who despises his neighbor is a sinner, 
PRO.14.21	but he who has mercy on the poor blesses him. 
PRO.14.22	Have they not erred, those who plan evil? 
PRO.14.22	But loyalty and faithfulness belong to those who plan good. 
PRO.14.23	In all toil, there is profit, 
PRO.14.23	but the talk
PRO.14.24	The crown of the wise is their wealth; 
PRO.14.24	the folly of fools is folly. 
PRO.14.25	He who saves lives
PRO.14.25	but he who utters lies is a betrayer. 
PRO.14.26	In the fear of Yahweh, there is confidence of strength, 
PRO.14.26	and for his children, there will be refuge. 
PRO.14.27	The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of life, 
PRO.14.27	in order to turn from the snares of death. 
PRO.14.28	In the multitude of people is the glory of the king, 
PRO.14.28	but without a population, a prince is ruined. 
PRO.14.29	He who is slow to anger has great understanding, 
PRO.14.29	but the hasty of spirit
PRO.14.30	A heart
PRO.14.30	but causes bones of passion to rot. 
PRO.14.31	He who oppresses the poor insults him who made him, 
PRO.14.31	but he who has mercy on the poor honors him. 
PRO.14.32	By his evildoing, the wicked will be overthrown, 
PRO.14.32	and the righteous will find refuge in his death. 
PRO.14.33	In the heart
PRO.14.33	but even in the midst of fools it becomes known. 
PRO.14.34	Righteousness will exalt a nation, 
PRO.14.34	but sin is a reproach to a people. 
PRO.14.35	The favor of a king is for the servant who deals wisely, 
PRO.14.35	but his wrath will be on him who acts shamefully. 
PRO.15.1	 A soft answer will turn away wrath, 
PRO.15.1	but a word of trouble will stir anger.
PRO.15.2	The tongue of the wise will dispense knowledge, 
PRO.15.2	but the mouth of fools will pour out folly. 
PRO.15.3	In every place, the eyes of Yahweh 
PRO.15.3	keep watch over the evil and the good. 
PRO.15.4	Gentleness
PRO.15.4	but perverseness in it
PRO.15.5	A fool will despise the instruction of his father, 
PRO.15.5	but he who guards reproof is prudent. 
PRO.15.6	In the house of the righteous there is much treasure, 
PRO.15.6	but the income of the wicked brings trouble. 
PRO.15.7	The lips of the wise will spread knowledge, 
PRO.15.7	but the heart
PRO.15.8	The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination of Yahweh, 
PRO.15.8	but the prayer of the upright is his delight. 
PRO.15.9	An abomination of Yahweh is the way of the wicked, 
PRO.15.9	but he who pursues righteousness he will love. 
PRO.15.10	Severe discipline belongs to him who forsakes the way; 
PRO.15.10	he who hates a rebuke will die. 
PRO.15.11	Sheol
PRO.15.11	how much more
PRO.15.12	A scoffer does not like his rebuke;
PRO.15.12	to the wise he will not go. 
PRO.15.13	A heart
PRO.15.13	but in sorrow of heart
PRO.15.14	The heart of him who understands will seek knowledge, 
PRO.15.14	but the faces of fools, they
PRO.15.15	All the days of the poor are hard, 
PRO.15.15	but goodness of heart
PRO.15.16	Better is little with the fear of Yahweh 
PRO.15.16	than great treasure and trouble with it.
PRO.15.17	Better is a dinner of vegetables when
PRO.15.17	than a fattened ox and hatred with it.
PRO.15.18	A man who is hot-tempered will stir up strife, 
PRO.15.18	but he who is slow to anger,
PRO.15.19	The way of the lazy is like a hedge of thorns,
PRO.15.19	but the path of the upright is a highway. 
PRO.15.20	A child of wisdom will make a father glad, 
PRO.15.20	but a foolish person,
PRO.15.21	Folly is a joy to him who lacks sense,
PRO.15.21	and a person of understanding will walk upright.
PRO.15.22	Plans go wrong when there is no counsel, 
PRO.15.22	but with many advisors it will succeed. 
PRO.15.23	Joy belongs to a man with answers in his mouth, 
PRO.15.23	and a word in its time, how good it is! 
PRO.15.24	The path of life leads upward for him who has insight, 
PRO.15.24	in order to turn away from Sheol below. 
PRO.15.25	The house of the proud, Yahweh will tear it down, 
PRO.15.25	but he will maintain the property line
PRO.15.26	Plans of evil are an abomination of Yahweh, 
PRO.15.26	but gracious words are pure. 
PRO.15.27	He who makes trouble for his house is he who is greedy for unjust gain, 
PRO.15.27	but he who hates bribes will live. 
PRO.15.28	A heart
PRO.15.28	but a mouth of wickedness will pour out deceit. 
PRO.15.29	Yahweh is far from the wicked, 
PRO.15.29	but the prayers of the righteous he will hear. 
PRO.15.30	From the light of the eyes, the heart
PRO.15.30	and good news will enliven the bones.
PRO.15.31	The ear of him who listens to admonitions of life, 
PRO.15.31	in the midst of the wise it will lodge. 
PRO.15.32	He who ignores instruction despises himself,
PRO.15.32	but he who hears admonition gains heart.
PRO.15.33	Fear of Yahweh is the instruction of the wise, 
PRO.15.33	and before honor comes humility. 
PRO.16.1	 To mortals belong the plans of the heart, 
PRO.16.1	but from Yahweh comes the answer of the tongue. 
PRO.16.2	All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, 
PRO.16.2	but Yahweh weighs the spirit.
PRO.16.3	Commit your work to Yahweh, 
PRO.16.3	and your plans will be established. 
PRO.16.4	All Yahweh has made is for his
PRO.16.4	and even the wicked for the day of trouble. 
PRO.16.5	An abomination of Yahweh are all who are arrogant of heart;
PRO.16.5	rest assured,
PRO.16.6	By loyalty and faithfulness, iniquity will be covered over,
PRO.16.6	and by fear of Yahweh one turns
PRO.16.7	When the ways of a man are pleasing to Yahweh, 
PRO.16.7	even his enemies he will cause to make peace with him. 
PRO.16.8	Better is little with righteousness 
PRO.16.8	than great income with no justice. 
PRO.16.9	The mind
PRO.16.9	and Yahweh will direct his steps. 
PRO.16.10	A decision is upon the lips of a king; 
PRO.16.10	in judgment his mouth will not sin. 
PRO.16.11	A balance and scales of justice belong to Yahweh; 
PRO.16.11	all the weights of the bag are his work. 
PRO.16.12	An abomination to kings is doing evil, 
PRO.16.12	for by righteousness the throne will be established. 
PRO.16.13	The delight of kings are the lips of righteousness, 
PRO.16.13	and he who speaks what is upright he will love. 
PRO.16.14	The wrath of a king is a messenger of death, 
PRO.16.14	but one who is wise will appease
PRO.16.15	In the light of the face of the king there is life, 
PRO.16.15	and his favor is like a cloud of spring rain. 
PRO.16.16	Getting wisdom: how much
PRO.16.16	And getting understanding: it is chosen over
PRO.16.17	The highway of the upright, it turns from evil, 
PRO.16.17	he who guards himself
PRO.16.18	Before destruction comes pride, 
PRO.16.18	and before a fall, a haughty spirit.
PRO.16.19	Better a lowly spirit with the poor 
PRO.16.19	than dividing the spoil with the proud. 
PRO.16.20	He who is attentive to a matter will find goodness, 
PRO.16.20	and he who trusts in Yahweh, his own happiness. 
PRO.16.21	The wise of heart
PRO.16.21	but he who is pleasant of lips will increase persuasiveness. 
PRO.16.22	A fountain of life is wisdom for its owner,
PRO.16.22	but the instruction
PRO.16.23	The heart
PRO.16.23	and upon his lips, it
PRO.16.24	Pleasant sayings are a honeycomb, 
PRO.16.24	sweetness to the soul and healing to the bones. 
PRO.16.25	There is a way that seems upright to
PRO.16.25	but its end is the way of death. 
PRO.16.26	The life
PRO.16.26	for his hunger
PRO.16.27	A man of wickedness concocts evil, 
PRO.16.27	and his lips are like a scorching fire. 
PRO.16.28	A person of perversity will spread dissent, 
PRO.16.28	and he who whispers separates a close friend. 
PRO.16.29	A person of violence will entice his neighbor 
PRO.16.29	and cause him to walk on a way that is not good. 
PRO.16.30	He who winks his eyes does so in order to plan perverse things; 
PRO.16.30	he who purses his lips will bring evil to pass. 
PRO.16.31	A crown of glory is gray hair; 
PRO.16.31	by a righteous life it is gained. 
PRO.16.32	He who is slow to anger
PRO.16.32	and he who controls his spirit than him who captures a city. 
PRO.16.33	The lot will be cast into the lap, 
PRO.16.33	but all of its decisions are from Yahweh. 
PRO.17.1	 Better a dry morsel and quiet with it 
PRO.17.1	than a house filled with feasts of strife. 
PRO.17.2	A slave who deals wisely will rule over a child who acts shamefully, 
PRO.17.2	and in the midst of brothers he will share his inheritance. 
PRO.17.3	A crucible is for the silver, and a furnace is for the gold, 
PRO.17.3	but Yahweh will test hearts. 
PRO.17.4	He who does evil listens to lips of wickedness, 
PRO.17.4	and the liar gives heed to the tongue of mischief. 
PRO.17.5	He who mocks the poor insults him who made him; 
PRO.17.5	he who rejoices at calamity will not go unpunished. 
PRO.17.6	The crown of the elderly are grandchildren,
PRO.17.6	and the glory of children is their fathers. 
PRO.17.7	Fine speech
PRO.17.7	still less
PRO.17.8	The bribe is a stone of magic in the eyes of its owner;
PRO.17.8	everywhere
PRO.17.9	He who forgives an affront fosters love, 
PRO.17.9	but he who waits on a matter will alienate a friend. 
PRO.17.10	A rebuke strikes him who understands 
PRO.17.10	deeper than one hundred blows to a fool. 
PRO.17.11	An evil person will seek only rebellion, 
PRO.17.11	and a cruel messenger will be sent against him. 
PRO.17.12	May a man meet a she-bear robbed of offspring 
PRO.17.12	and not a fool in his folly. 
PRO.17.13	For he who returns evil for good, 
PRO.17.13	evil will not depart from his house. 
PRO.17.14	Like the release of water is the beginning of strife; 
PRO.17.14	before it breaks out, stop the quarrel. 
PRO.17.15	He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous, 
PRO.17.15	the two of them are both abominations of Yahweh. 
PRO.17.16	Why is this? A price in the hand of a fool, 
PRO.17.16	in order to buy wisdom where
PRO.17.17	The friend loves at all times
PRO.17.17	but a brother is born for adversity. 
PRO.17.18	A person who lacks sense
PRO.17.18	he becomes security before his neighbor. 
PRO.17.19	He who loves transgression loves strife; 
PRO.17.19	he who builds his high thresholds seeks destruction. 
PRO.17.20	He who is crooked of heart
PRO.17.20	and he who is perverse, by his tongue he will fall into calamity. 
PRO.17.21	He who begets a fool, there is trouble for him; 
PRO.17.21	the father of a fool will not rejoice. 
PRO.17.22	A cheerful heart is good medicine, 
PRO.17.22	but a downcast spirit will dry out bones. 
PRO.17.23	The wicked will accept a bribe from the lap, 
PRO.17.23	in order to pervert the ways of justice. 
PRO.17.24	He who understands sets his face toward wisdom, 
PRO.17.24	but the eyes of a fool, to the end of the earth.
PRO.17.25	A grief to his father is the child of a fool, 
PRO.17.25	and bitterness to her who bore him. 
PRO.17.26	Also, imposing a fine on the righteous is not good, 
PRO.17.26	nor to flog nobles for uprightness. 
PRO.17.27	He who spares his sayings knows knowledge, 
PRO.17.27	and a cool spirit is a man of understanding. 
PRO.17.28	Even a fool who keeps silent shall be considered wise;
PRO.17.28	he who closes his lips is intelligent. 
PRO.18.1	 He who is selfish seeks a craving;
PRO.18.1	against all sound judgment he shows contempt. 
PRO.18.2	A fool will not take pleasure in understanding, 
PRO.18.2	but in expressing his heart.
PRO.18.3	With the coming of wickedness comes contempt also, 
PRO.18.3	and with dishonor, disgrace. 
PRO.18.4	Deep waters are words of the mouth of a man; 
PRO.18.4	a gushing stream is a fountain of wisdom. 
PRO.18.5	Being partial to faces of evil is not good, 
PRO.18.5	nor to subvert the righteous at the judgment. 
PRO.18.6	The lips of a fool will bring strife, 
PRO.18.6	and his mouth calls out for a flogging. 
PRO.18.7	The mouth of a fool is ruin to him, 
PRO.18.7	and his lips are a snare to his soul.
PRO.18.8	The words of a whisper are like delicious morsels, 
PRO.18.8	and they themselves go down to inner parts of the body. 
PRO.18.9	Even he who is slack in his work, 
PRO.18.9	he is brother to a master
PRO.18.10	A tower of strength is the name of Yahweh; 
PRO.18.10	into him
PRO.18.11	The wealth of the rich is his strong city,
PRO.18.11	and like a wall, it is high in his imagination. 
PRO.18.12	In the presence of destruction, the heart
PRO.18.12	but in the presence of honor, humble. 
PRO.18.13	He who returns a word before he will hear, 
PRO.18.13	folly itself belongs to him as well as
PRO.18.14	The spirit of a man will endure his sickness, 
PRO.18.14	but a broken spirit, who may bear it? 
PRO.18.15	An intelligent mind
PRO.18.15	and the ear of the wise will seek knowledge. 
PRO.18.16	The gift of a person will open doors for him, 
PRO.18.16	and before the great, it gives him access. 
PRO.18.17	The first in his dispute is deemed righteous, 
PRO.18.17	but his neighbor will come and examine him. 
PRO.18.18	The lot will put an end to disputes, 
PRO.18.18	and between powerful contenders it will decide. 
PRO.18.19	A brother who is offended is worse than a city of strength, 
PRO.18.19	and quarrels are like the bars of a fortification. 
PRO.18.20	From the fruit of a man’s mouth, his stomach will be satisfied, 
PRO.18.20	as for the yield of his lips, it will satisfy. 
PRO.18.21	Death and life are in the power
PRO.18.21	and those who love her
PRO.18.22	He who finds a wife
PRO.18.22	and he will obtain favor from Yahweh. 
PRO.18.23	The poor may speak entreaties, 
PRO.18.23	but the rich will answer roughly. 
PRO.18.24	A man of many friends will come to ruin, 
PRO.18.24	but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. 
PRO.19.1	 Better a poor person walking in integrity 
PRO.19.1	than one who is perverse in his speech
PRO.19.2	Also, a life
PRO.19.2	and he who moves quickly with his feet misses the mark.
PRO.19.3	As for the folly of humankind, its way leads to ruin, 
PRO.19.3	and against Yahweh his heart
PRO.19.4	Wealth adds many friends, 
PRO.19.4	but the poor will be left by his friends. 
PRO.19.5	A witness of falsehood will not go unpunished, 
PRO.19.5	and he who breathes lies will not escape. 
PRO.19.6	Many will seek favor before the generous, 
PRO.19.6	and everyone is the friend of a man of gifts.
PRO.19.7	All the brothers of the poor, if they hate him, 
PRO.19.7	how much more will his friends keep away from him. 
PRO.19.7	He pursues them with words, and they are gone.
PRO.19.8	He who acquires wisdom loves himself;
PRO.19.8	he who guards understanding loves to find good. 
PRO.19.9	A false witness will not go unpunished, 
PRO.19.9	and he who breathes lies will perish. 
PRO.19.10	For a fool living in luxury is not fitting, 
PRO.19.10	any more than it is for a slave to rule over princes. 
PRO.19.11	The understanding of a person makes him slow to his anger,
PRO.19.11	and his glory overlooks offense. 
PRO.19.12	The rage of a king growls like a lion, 
PRO.19.12	but his favor is like dew on the grass. 
PRO.19.13	A foolish child is a ruin to his father, 
PRO.19.13	and the quarreling of a woman
PRO.19.14	A house and wealth are an inheritance from fathers, 
PRO.19.14	but from Yahweh comes a woman
PRO.19.15	Laziness will bring on a deep sleep, 
PRO.19.15	and a person
PRO.19.16	He who guards commandments guards his life;
PRO.19.16	he who is careless of his ways will be killed. 
PRO.19.17	He who lends to Yahweh is he who is kind to the poor, 
PRO.19.17	and his benefits he will repay to him. 
PRO.19.18	Discipline your child, for there is hope, 
PRO.19.18	but on his destruction do not set your desire.
PRO.19.19	A hot-tempered person pays a penalty; 
PRO.19.19	if you rescue him, you will do it yet again. 
PRO.19.20	Listen to advice and accept instruction 
PRO.19.20	so that you will gain wisdom for your future.
PRO.19.21	Many plans are in the heart
PRO.19.21	but the purpose of Yahweh will be established. 
PRO.19.22	The craving of a man is his steadfast loyalty, 
PRO.19.22	and it is better to be poor than a liar.
PRO.19.23	Fear of Yahweh leads to life; 
PRO.19.23	he who is filled with it will rest—he will not suffer harm. 
PRO.19.24	A lazy person buries his hand in the dish, 
PRO.19.24	and even to his mouth he will not bring it back. 
PRO.19.25	The scoffer you shall strike, and the simple, may they learn prudence, 
PRO.19.25	and reprove the intelligent and he will gain knowledge. 
PRO.19.26	He who does violence to a father, he who chases away a mother, 
PRO.19.26	is a child who causes shame and brings reproach. 
PRO.19.27	Cease to listen to instruction, my child, 
PRO.19.27	and you will stray
PRO.19.28	A worthless witness will mock justice, 
PRO.19.28	and the mouth of the wicked will devour iniquity. 
PRO.19.29	Judgments
PRO.19.29	and flogging for the back of fools. 
PRO.20.1	 Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, 
PRO.20.1	and any who go astray by it are not wise. 
PRO.20.2	Roaring like the lion is the dreaded anger of a king; 
PRO.20.2	he who provokes him forfeits his life.
PRO.20.3	It is honorable for the man to refrain from strife, 
PRO.20.3	but every fool will be quick to quarrel. 
PRO.20.4	The lazy person will not plow in season; 
PRO.20.4	he will expect at the harvest, but there will be nothing. 
PRO.20.5	Deep waters are like purpose in the heart
PRO.20.5	and a man of understanding will draw it
PRO.20.6	Many a person will proclaim his loyalty for himself, 
PRO.20.6	but a man who is trustworthy, who can find? 
PRO.20.7	He who walks in his integrity is righteous; 
PRO.20.7	happy are his children who follow him. 
PRO.20.8	A king who sits on the throne of judgment 
PRO.20.8	winnows all evil with his eyes. 
PRO.20.9	Who will say “I have made my heart
PRO.20.9	I am pure from my sin”? 
PRO.20.10	Stone and stone, measure and measure, 
PRO.20.10	both of them
PRO.20.11	Even by his acts, a young man
PRO.20.11	whether his acts are pure and upright. 
PRO.20.12	The ear that hears and the eye that sees, 
PRO.20.12	Yahweh has made them both.
PRO.20.13	Do not love sleep, lest you become poor; 
PRO.20.13	open your eyes and have plenty bread. 
PRO.20.14	“Bad, bad,” the buyer will say, 
PRO.20.14	but when one goes to him, then he will boast. 
PRO.20.15	There is gold and many costly stones, 
PRO.20.15	but precious jewels are lips of knowledge. 
PRO.20.16	Take his garment, for he has given security to a stranger, 
PRO.20.16	and on behalf of a foreigner—take it as pledge. 
PRO.20.17	Bread gained by deceit is sweet for the man, 
PRO.20.17	but afterward, his mouth will be filled with gravel. 
PRO.20.18	A plan
PRO.20.18	and with guidance make war. 
PRO.20.19	He reveals a secret, he who walks about with gossip, 
PRO.20.19	and do not associate with a babbler’s lips. 
PRO.20.20	He who curses his father and his mother, 
PRO.20.20	his lamp will be extinguished in the midst of darkness.
PRO.20.21	An inheritance acquired hastily at the beginning
PRO.20.21	will not be blessed at its end. 
PRO.20.22	Do not say “I will repay evil”; 
PRO.20.22	wait for Yahweh and he will deliver you. 
PRO.20.23	An abomination of Yahweh is a stone and a weight,
PRO.20.23	and scales of falsehood are not good. 
PRO.20.24	Away from Yahweh are the steps of a strong man, 
PRO.20.24	and how will humankind understand his ways? 
PRO.20.25	It is a snare to humankind to say rashly “It is holy,” 
PRO.20.25	and after vows, to scrutinize. 
PRO.20.26	A wise king winnows the wicked, 
PRO.20.26	and he will drive a wheel over them. 
PRO.20.27	The lamp of Yahweh is the spirit
PRO.20.27	he who searches every innermost part.
PRO.20.28	Loyalty and faithfulness will preserve a king, 
PRO.20.28	and he is upheld with the righteousness of his throne. 
PRO.20.29	The glory of young men is their strength,
PRO.20.29	but the beauty of the aged is gray hair. 
PRO.20.30	The blows of a wound will cleanse evil, 
PRO.20.30	as will
PRO.21.1	 Streams of water are the heart
PRO.21.1	wherever
PRO.21.2	Every way of a man is upright in his own eyes, 
PRO.21.2	but Yahweh weighs hearts.
PRO.21.3	Doing righteousness and justice is more acceptable 
PRO.21.3	to Yahweh than sacrifice. 
PRO.21.4	Haughtiness of the eyes and pride of heart, 
PRO.21.4	the lamp of the wicked are sin. 
PRO.21.5	The plans of the diligent only lead to abundance, 
PRO.21.5	but all who are hasty, only to want. 
PRO.21.6	He who makes treasure by a lying tongue 
PRO.21.6	is a fleeting vapor and seeker
PRO.21.7	The violence of the wicked will sweep them away, 
PRO.21.7	for they refuse to do justice. 
PRO.21.8	Crooked is the way of a man and a foreigner, 
PRO.21.8	but the pure is upright in his conduct. 
PRO.21.9	Better to dwell on the corner of a roof 
PRO.21.9	than to share a house with a woman
PRO.21.10	The soul
PRO.21.10	his neighbor will not find mercy in his eyes. 
PRO.21.11	With the punishment of a scoffer, the simple will become wise, 
PRO.21.11	and with the instruction of the wise, he will obtain knowledge. 
PRO.21.12	The righteous observes the house of the wicked; 
PRO.21.12	he throws the wicked to ruin. 
PRO.21.13	He who closes his ear from the cry of the poor, 
PRO.21.13	he also will cry out and not be heard. 
PRO.21.14	A gift in secret
PRO.21.14	and a concealed bribe,
PRO.21.15	It is a joy to the righteous to do justice, 
PRO.21.15	but dismay to those who do evil. 
PRO.21.16	Whoever wanders from the way of understanding, 
PRO.21.16	in the assembly of the dead
PRO.21.17	A man of want is he who loves pleasure; 
PRO.21.17	he who loves wine and oil
PRO.21.18	A ransom for the righteous is the wicked, 
PRO.21.18	and the faithless instead of the upright. 
PRO.21.19	Better to live in a land of wilderness 
PRO.21.19	than with a wife of quarrels and provocation. 
PRO.21.20	Precious treasure and oil are in the house of the wise, 
PRO.21.20	but the foolish person
PRO.21.21	He who pursues righteousness and kindness 
PRO.21.21	will find life, righteousness, and honor. 
PRO.21.22	To a city of warriors, the wise ascends, 
PRO.21.22	and he will bring down the stronghold—its object of trust. 
PRO.21.23	He who guards his mouth and his tongue, 
PRO.21.23	he guards his life
PRO.21.24	The proud, haughty one: “scoffer” is his name; 
PRO.21.24	he acts with arrogance of pride. 
PRO.21.25	The craving of a lazy person will kill him, 
PRO.21.25	for his hands refuse to work.
PRO.21.26	All day
PRO.21.26	but the righteous will give and not hold back. 
PRO.21.27	The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; 
PRO.21.27	how much more when he brings it in divisiveness! 
PRO.21.28	A false witness will perish, 
PRO.21.28	but a man who listens will testify with
PRO.21.29	A wicked man is strong in his countenance,
PRO.21.29	but the upright will appoint his paths. 
PRO.21.30	There is no wisdom, nor understanding, 
PRO.21.30	nor counsel to oppose Yahweh. 
PRO.21.31	A horse is prepared for the day of battle, 
PRO.21.31	but to Yahweh belongs the victory. 
PRO.22.1	 A reputation
PRO.22.1	favor is better than silver and gold.
PRO.22.2	Rich and poor have much in common; 
PRO.22.2	Yahweh is the maker of all of them. 
PRO.22.3	The clever sees danger and hides, 
PRO.22.3	but the simple go on and suffer. 
PRO.22.4	The reward of humility is the fear of Yahweh— 
PRO.22.4	wealth and honor and life. 
PRO.22.5	Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse; 
PRO.22.5	he who guards himself
PRO.22.6	Train the child concerning his way;
PRO.22.6	even when he is old, he will not stray from it. 
PRO.22.7	The rich will rule over the poor, 
PRO.22.7	and the borrower is a slave of the lender.
PRO.22.8	He who sows injustice will reap calamity, 
PRO.22.8	and the rod of his anger will fail. 
PRO.22.9	He who is generous
PRO.22.9	for he gives to the poor from his own bread. 
PRO.22.10	Drive out a scoffer and strife will go out; 
PRO.22.10	quarrel and abuse will cease. 
PRO.22.11	He who loves purity of heart 
PRO.22.11	and hasgracious speech,
PRO.22.12	The eyes of Yahweh keep watch over knowledge, 
PRO.22.12	but he will overthrow the words of the faithless. 
PRO.22.13	A lazy person says “A lion in the street! 
PRO.22.13	In the middle of the highway, I shall be killed!” 
PRO.22.14	A deep pit is the mouth of an adulteress,
PRO.22.14	he with whom Yahweh is angry will fall there. 
PRO.22.15	Folly is bound up in the heart
PRO.22.15	the rod of discipline will drive it
PRO.22.16	He who oppresses the poor in order to enrich himself, 
PRO.22.16	or gives to the rich, will come to poverty.
PRO.22.17	Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise; 
PRO.22.17	you shall apply your heart
PRO.22.18	For it is pleasant if you guard them within you;
PRO.22.18	together they will be ready upon your lips. 
PRO.22.19	In order for your trust to be in Yahweh, 
PRO.22.19	I have made them known to you today
PRO.22.20	Have I not written for you thirty sayings 
PRO.22.20	with admonitions and knowledge? 
PRO.22.21	In order to show you what is right—sayings of truth— 
PRO.22.21	in order to return a true saying to him who sent you. 
PRO.22.22	Do not rob the poor because he is poor, 
PRO.22.22	and do not crush the afflicted at the gate; 
PRO.22.23	For Yahweh will plead their case 
PRO.22.23	and despoil those who despoil them of life.
PRO.22.24	Do not befriend an owner
PRO.22.24	and with a man of wrath you shall not associate; 
PRO.22.25	lest you learn his way 
PRO.22.25	and become entangled in a snare to yourself.
PRO.22.26	Do not be with those who give a pledge
PRO.22.26	by becoming
PRO.22.27	If there is nothing for you to pay,
PRO.22.27	why will he take your bed from under you? 
PRO.22.28	Do not remove an ancient boundary marker 
PRO.22.28	which your ancestors
PRO.22.29	A man who is skillful in his work, you shall see: 
PRO.22.29	before kings, he will serve; 
PRO.22.29	he will not serve before the commoners. 
PRO.23.1	 When you sit to eat with a ruler, 
PRO.23.1	you shall surely observe what is before you, 
PRO.23.2	and you shall put a knife to your throat 
PRO.23.2	if you have a big appetite.
PRO.23.3	Do not desire his delicacies, 
PRO.23.3	for
PRO.23.4	Do not tire in order to become rich; 
PRO.23.4	out of your understanding, may you desist. 
PRO.23.5	Your eyes will alight
PRO.23.5	for suddenly it will make for itself wings 
PRO.23.5	like an eagle and it will be exhausted in the heavens. 
PRO.23.6	Do not eat the bread of the stingy,
PRO.23.6	and do not desire his delicacies. 
PRO.23.7	For, like hair in his throat,
PRO.23.7	“Eat and drink!” he will say to you, 
PRO.23.7	but his heart will not be with you. 
PRO.23.8	Your morsel you have eaten, you will vomit it up, 
PRO.23.8	and you will waste your pleasant words. 
PRO.23.9	In the ears of a fool do not speak, 
PRO.23.9	for he will despise the wisdom of your words. 
PRO.23.10	Do not remove an ancient boundary marker, 
PRO.23.10	and on the fields of orphans do not encroach; 
PRO.23.11	For their redeemer is strong, 
PRO.23.11	he himself will plead their cause against you. 
PRO.23.12	Apply your heart
PRO.23.12	and your ear to sayings of knowledge. 
PRO.23.13	Do not withhold discipline from a child, 
PRO.23.13	if you will beat him with the rod, he will not die. 
PRO.23.14	As for you, with the rod you shall beat him, 
PRO.23.14	and his life
PRO.23.15	My child, if your heart
PRO.23.15	my heart will be glad—even me! 
PRO.23.16	And my insides
PRO.23.16	when your lips speak what is upright. 
PRO.23.17	May your heart
PRO.23.17	but live in fear of Yahweh all day.
PRO.23.18	Surely
PRO.23.18	and your hope will not be cut off. 
PRO.23.19	You, my child, hear and be wise, 
PRO.23.19	and direct your heart
PRO.23.20	Do not be among drinkers of wine, 
PRO.23.20	among gluttonous eaters of their meat.
PRO.23.21	For the drunkard and gluttonous, they will become poor, 
PRO.23.21	and with rags, drowsiness will clothe them. 
PRO.23.22	Listen to your father—he who gave you life,
PRO.23.22	and do not despise your mother when
PRO.23.23	Buy truth and do not sell it, 
PRO.23.23	wisdom and instruction and understanding. 
PRO.23.24	The father of the righteous will surely rejoice; 
PRO.23.24	he who bears a wise person will be happy with him. 
PRO.23.25	May your father and your mother be glad, 
PRO.23.25	and may she who bore you rejoice. 
PRO.23.26	My child, may you give your heart
PRO.23.26	and may your eyes delight in my ways. 
PRO.23.27	For a deep pit is a prostitute,
PRO.23.27	and a narrow well is an adulteress.
PRO.23.28	She is also like a robber lying in wait, 
PRO.23.28	and the faithless among mankind she increases. 
PRO.23.29	To whom is woe? To whom is sorrow? To whom are quarrels? To whom is complaint? 
PRO.23.29	To whom are wounds without cause? To whom is redness of the eyes? 
PRO.23.30	To those who linger over wine, 
PRO.23.30	to those who come to try mixed wine. 
PRO.23.31	Do not look at wine when it is red, 
PRO.23.31	when it sparkles
PRO.23.31	going down smoothly. 
PRO.23.32	In the end,
PRO.23.32	and it will sting like an adder. 
PRO.23.33	Your eyes will see strange things, 
PRO.23.33	and your heart
PRO.23.34	And you will be like him who lies down in the heart of the sea, 
PRO.23.34	and like him who lies down on top of a mast. 
PRO.23.35	“They struck me; I was not hurt. They beat me; I did not know it. 
PRO.23.35	When I will awake, I will continue; I will seek it again.” 
PRO.24.1	 Do not envy men of evil, 
PRO.24.1	and do not desire to be with them. 
PRO.24.2	For their minds will devise violence, 
PRO.24.2	and their lips will speak mischief. 
PRO.24.3	By wisdom a house is built, 
PRO.24.3	and by understanding it is established. 
PRO.24.4	And by knowledge, rooms are filled 
PRO.24.4	with all riches, precious and pleasant. 
PRO.24.5	The warrior of wisdom is in strength, 
PRO.24.5	and a man of knowledge is strong in power. 
PRO.24.6	For with wise guidance you shall make war for yourself, 
PRO.24.6	and victory is in an abundance of counsel. 
PRO.24.7	Wisdom is too high for fools; 
PRO.24.7	at the gate he will not open his mouth. 
PRO.24.8	He who plans to do evil for
PRO.24.8	they will call him “master
PRO.24.9	Devising folly is a sin, 
PRO.24.9	and an abomination to humankind is a scoffer. 
PRO.24.10	If you faint on the day of adversity, 
PRO.24.10	little is your strength. 
PRO.24.11	Rescue those who are led away to the death 
PRO.24.11	and those who stagger to the slaughter. If you hold back, 
PRO.24.12	if you say, “Look, we do not know this,” 
PRO.24.12	does not he who weighs hearts perceive it? 
PRO.24.12	And he who keeps your soul,
PRO.24.12	he knows and will repay humankind according to his deeds. 
PRO.24.13	My child, eat honey, for it is good, 
PRO.24.13	and the dripping of the honeycomb is sweet to your taste. 
PRO.24.14	Thus know wisdom for the sake of your soul,
PRO.24.14	if you find it, then there is a future, 
PRO.24.14	and your hope will not be cut off. 
PRO.24.15	Do not lie in wait like an outlaw against the home of the righteous; 
PRO.24.15	do not do violence to his dwelling place. 
PRO.24.16	For seven times the righteous will fall, but he will rise, 
PRO.24.16	but the wicked will be overthrown by calamity. 
PRO.24.17	While your enemies are falling, do not rejoice; 
PRO.24.17	when he trips himself, may your heart
PRO.24.18	lest Yahweh see and it be evil in his eyes, 
PRO.24.18	and turn his anger away from him. 
PRO.24.19	Do not fret because of the evildoers; 
PRO.24.19	do not envy the wicked. 
PRO.24.20	For there will not be a future for the evil; 
PRO.24.20	the lamp of the wicked will die out. 
PRO.24.21	Fear Yahweh, my son, and the king; 
PRO.24.21	with those who change, do not associate. 
PRO.24.22	For suddenly their disaster will come, 
PRO.24.22	and the ruin of both of them,
PRO.24.23	These sayings are also for the wise: 
PRO.24.23	Partiality
PRO.24.24	Whoever says to the guilty, “You are righteous,” the people will curse him; 
PRO.24.24	the nations will abhor him. 
PRO.24.25	But they who rebuke will have delight, 
PRO.24.25	and upon them blessings of goodness will come. 
PRO.24.26	He will kiss the lips, 
PRO.24.26	he who gives an honest answer. 
PRO.24.27	Prepare your work in the street and get it ready for yourself in the field; 
PRO.24.27	afterward, then
PRO.24.28	Do not be a witness without cause against your neighbor 
PRO.24.28	nor deceive with your lips. 
PRO.24.29	Do not say, “Just as he has done to me, so shall I do to him; 
PRO.24.29	I will pay back the man according to his deed.” 
PRO.24.30	I passed by the field of a lazy person, 
PRO.24.30	and over the vineyard of a person lacking sense;
PRO.24.31	and behold, it was overgrown—all of it was covered with thorns, its surface with nettles, 
PRO.24.31	and its stone wall
PRO.24.32	Then I myself saw and my heart
PRO.24.32	I looked, and I took hold of instruction: 
PRO.24.33	A little sleep, a little slumber, 
PRO.24.33	a little folding of the hands for rest, 
PRO.24.34	and your poverty will come running, 
PRO.24.34	and your lack like an armed warrior. 
PRO.25.1	These are also proverbs of Solomon which officials of Hezekiah king of Judah copied: 
PRO.25.2	The glory of God
PRO.25.2	but the glory of kings searches out things. 
PRO.25.3	As heaven is to height and the earth is to depth, 
PRO.25.3	so is the heart
PRO.25.4	Remove the dross from silver, 
PRO.25.4	and it will become a vessel for the smith. 
PRO.25.5	Remove the wicked before a king, 
PRO.25.5	and his throne will be established in righteousness.
PRO.25.6	Do not promote yourself before the king, 
PRO.25.6	and in the place of the great ones do not stand. 
PRO.25.7	For it is better that he say to you, “Ascend here,” 
PRO.25.7	than he humble you before a noble. 
PRO.25.7	What your eyes have seen, 
PRO.25.8	do not hastily bring out to court, 
PRO.25.8	for
PRO.25.8	when your neighbor puts you to shame? 
PRO.25.9	Argue your argument with your neighbor himself, 
PRO.25.9	the secret of another do not disclose, 
PRO.25.10	lest he who hears shame you 
PRO.25.10	and your ill repute will not end. 
PRO.25.11	Apples of gold in a setting of silver 
PRO.25.11	is a matter spoken at
PRO.25.12	A ring of gold and an ornament of fine gold 
PRO.25.12	is a rebuke of the wise to the ear of a listener. 
PRO.25.13	Like the cold of snow on a day
PRO.25.13	is a faithful messenger to those who send him, 
PRO.25.13	and the soul
PRO.25.14	Like clouds and wind when there is no rain, 
PRO.25.14	so too is a man who boasts in a gift of deception. 
PRO.25.15	With patience
PRO.25.15	and a soft tongue will break a bone.
PRO.25.16	If you find honey, eat what is sufficient for you, 
PRO.25.16	lest you have your fill of it and vomit it out. 
PRO.25.17	Make your foot scarce in the house of your neighbor, 
PRO.25.17	lest he become weary of you and hate you. 
PRO.25.18	Like a club and sword and a sharp arrow 
PRO.25.18	is a man who bears false witness against his neighbor. 
PRO.25.19	A bad tooth and a lame foot 
PRO.25.19	is the trust of a faithless person in a time
PRO.25.20	Like one who removes a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar on natron,
PRO.25.20	is he who sings songs to a heavy heart. 
PRO.25.21	If your enemy is hungry, feed him bread, 
PRO.25.21	and if thirsty, let him drink water. 
PRO.25.22	For coals of fire you will heap upon his head, 
PRO.25.22	and Yahweh will reward you. 
PRO.25.23	The wind of the north produces rain, 
PRO.25.23	and a backbiting tongue, angry faces. 
PRO.25.24	Better to live upon the corner of a roof 
PRO.25.24	than with a woman
PRO.25.25	Like cold water
PRO.25.25	so too is good news from a distant place. 
PRO.25.26	Like a muddied spring or a polluted fountain 
PRO.25.26	is the righteous who gives way before the wicked. 
PRO.25.27	To eat much honey is not good, 
PRO.25.27	nor is seeking one’s honor
PRO.25.28	A breached city where there is no wall 
PRO.25.28	is like a man who has no
PRO.26.1	 Like snow in the summer and like rain at the harvest, 
PRO.26.1	so honor is not fitting for a fool. 
PRO.26.2	Like the sparrow is to fluttering and like the swallow is to flying, 
PRO.26.2	so an undeserved curse does not go forth. 
PRO.26.3	A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, 
PRO.26.3	and a rod for the back of fools. 
PRO.26.4	Do not answer a fool according to his folly 
PRO.26.4	lest you become like him—even you. 
PRO.26.5	Answer a fool according to his folly, 
PRO.26.5	or else he will be wise in his own eyes. 
PRO.26.6	Like cutting off feet or drinking violence, 
PRO.26.6	so is he who sends messages in the hand of a fool. 
PRO.26.7	Like legs that hang limp from a lame person, 
PRO.26.7	so is a proverb in the mouth of fools. 
PRO.26.8	Like binding a stone in a sling, 
PRO.26.8	so is giving honor to a fool. 
PRO.26.9	Like a thorn that goes up in the hand of a drunkard, 
PRO.26.9	so is a proverb in the mouth of fools. 
PRO.26.10	Like an archer who wounds everyone, 
PRO.26.10	so is he who hires a fool or he who hires passersby. 
PRO.26.11	Like a dog returning to his vomit 
PRO.26.11	is a fool reverting to his folly. 
PRO.26.12	Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? 
PRO.26.12	There is more hope for a fool than for him. 
PRO.26.13	A lazy person says “A lion is in the road! 
PRO.26.13	A lion among the streets!” 
PRO.26.14	The door turns on its hinge, 
PRO.26.14	and a lazy person on his bed. 
PRO.26.15	A lazy person buries his hands in the dish; 
PRO.26.15	he is too tired to return it to his mouth. 
PRO.26.16	A lazy person is wiser in his eyes 
PRO.26.16	than seven who answer discreetly. 
PRO.26.17	Grabbing onto the ears of a dog 
PRO.26.17	passing by is one who meddles in a quarrel that is not his own. 
PRO.26.18	Like a maniac who shoots 
PRO.26.18	firebrands, arrows, and death, 
PRO.26.19	so is a man who deceives his neighbor, 
PRO.26.19	but says “Am I not joking?” 
PRO.26.20	For lack of wood, a fire goes out, 
PRO.26.20	and where there is no whisperer, quarreling will cease. 
PRO.26.21	As charcoal is to hot embers and wood is to fire, 
PRO.26.21	so a man of quarrels is to kindling strife. 
PRO.26.22	The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels, 
PRO.26.22	and they go down to the inner parts of the body. 
PRO.26.23	Like impure silver
PRO.26.23	so are smooth lips and an evil heart
PRO.26.24	On his lips, an enemy will pretend, 
PRO.26.24	but inside
PRO.26.25	When he makes his voice gracious, do not believe him, 
PRO.26.25	for seven abominations are in his heart. 
PRO.26.26	Though hatred is covered with guile, 
PRO.26.26	its evil will be exposed in the assembly. 
PRO.26.27	He who digs a pit, in it he will fall, 
PRO.26.27	and he who rolls a stone, on him it will come back. 
PRO.26.28	A tongue of deceit hates its victim, 
PRO.26.28	and a flattering mouth makes ruin. 
PRO.27.1	 Do not boast about tomorrow,
PRO.27.1	for you do not know what the day will bring. 
PRO.27.2	May another praise you and not your own mouth, 
PRO.27.2	a stranger and not your own lips. 
PRO.27.3	Heavy is a stone and weighty is sand, 
PRO.27.3	but the provocation of a fool is heavier than both of them. 
PRO.27.4	Cruel is wrath and overwhelming is anger, 
PRO.27.4	but who will stand before jealousy? 
PRO.27.5	Better a rebuke that is open 
PRO.27.5	than a love that is hidden. 
PRO.27.6	The wounds of a friend mean well, 
PRO.27.6	but the kisses of an enemy are profane. 
PRO.27.7	An appetite
PRO.27.7	but to an appetite
PRO.27.8	Like a bird that strays from its nest, 
PRO.27.8	so is a man who strays from his place. 
PRO.27.9	Perfume and incense will gladden a heart, 
PRO.27.9	and the pleasantness of one’s friend is personal advice.
PRO.27.10	As for your friend and a friend of your father, do not forsake them, 
PRO.27.10	and the house of your brother, do not enter on the day of your calamity. 
PRO.27.10	Better is a close neighbor than a distant brother. 
PRO.27.11	Be wise, my child, and make my heart glad, 
PRO.27.11	and I will answer him who reproaches me with a word. 
PRO.27.12	When the clever sees danger, he hides; 
PRO.27.12	the simple go on and suffer. 
PRO.27.13	Take his garment, for he gives surety to a stranger, 
PRO.27.13	and to an adulteress
PRO.27.14	He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice 
PRO.27.14	early in the morning, 
PRO.27.14	a curse will be reckoned to him. 
PRO.27.15	Dripping constantly on a day of heavy rain 
PRO.27.15	and a woman
PRO.27.16	In restraining her, he restrains wind,
PRO.27.16	and his right hand will grasp oil
PRO.27.17	As iron sharpens
PRO.27.17	so one man sharpens another.
PRO.27.18	He who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, 
PRO.27.18	and he who guards his master
PRO.27.19	As the waters reflect face to face,
PRO.27.19	so the heart of a person reflects the person. 
PRO.27.20	Sheol
PRO.27.20	and the eyes of a person will not be satisfied either. 
PRO.27.21	A crucible is for the silver, and a furnace for the gold, 
PRO.27.21	but a man is tested by the mouth of him who praises him. 
PRO.27.22	If you crush a fool in the mortar with the pestle along with
PRO.27.22	it will not drive folly from upon him. 
PRO.27.23	You will surely know the condition
PRO.27.23	your heart
PRO.27.24	For riches are not forever, 
PRO.27.24	nor a crown for generation after generation. 
PRO.27.25	When the grass is gone, then green growth will appear, 
PRO.27.25	and the herbs of the mountains will be gathered. 
PRO.27.26	Lambs will be your clothing, 
PRO.27.26	and goats the price of the field. 
PRO.27.27	And there will be enough goats’ milk for your food, 
PRO.27.27	for the food of your household and the nourishment
PRO.28.1	 The wicked flee, but no one pursues, 
PRO.28.1	but the righteous is bold like a lion. 
PRO.28.2	By the rebellion of a land, her rulers increase, 
PRO.28.2	but by a person of intelligence who knows justice, it will last. 
PRO.28.3	A man who is poor and oppresses the impoverished 
PRO.28.3	is a beating rain that leaves
PRO.28.4	Those who forsake instruction will praise the wicked, 
PRO.28.4	but they who guard instruction will struggle against them. 
PRO.28.5	Men of evil do not understand justice, 
PRO.28.5	but seekers of Yahweh understand completely.
PRO.28.6	Better to be poor and walking in one’s integrity 
PRO.28.6	than to be crooked of ways when one is rich. 
PRO.28.7	He who keeps instruction is a child of understanding, 
PRO.28.7	but the companion of gluttons will shame his father. 
PRO.28.8	He who augments his wealth with interest and with usury 
PRO.28.8	gathers it for him who is kind to the poor. 
PRO.28.9	He who turns his ear from listening to instruction, 
PRO.28.9	even his prayer is an abomination. 
PRO.28.10	He who misleads the upright onto the way of evil, 
PRO.28.10	into his pits he will fall. 
PRO.28.10	But as for the blameless, they will inherit good. 
PRO.28.11	A man of wealth is wise in his own eyes, 
PRO.28.11	but the intelligent poor sees through him. 
PRO.28.12	When the righteous triumphs, great is the glory, 
PRO.28.12	but with the rising of the wicked, a person will be hidden. 
PRO.28.13	He who conceals his transgression will not prosper, 
PRO.28.13	but he who confesses and forsakes will obtain mercy. 
PRO.28.14	Happy is the person who fears continuously, 
PRO.28.14	but he who is stubborn of heart,
PRO.28.15	Like a roaring lion and a charging bear 
PRO.28.15	is a wicked ruler over a poor people. 
PRO.28.16	A ruler who lacks understanding is
PRO.28.16	but those who hate unjust gain will have long
PRO.28.17	A person who is burdened with the blood of another,
PRO.28.17	until death he will flee; 
PRO.28.17	do not take hold of him. 
PRO.28.18	He who walks in integrity will be safe, 
PRO.28.18	but he who takes crooked paths will fall in one. 
PRO.28.19	He who tills his ground will have plenty bread, 
PRO.28.19	but he who follows fantasies will have plenty of poverty. 
PRO.28.20	A man of faithfulness has abundant blessings, 
PRO.28.20	but he who hurries to become rich will not go unpunished. 
PRO.28.21	Showing partiality
PRO.28.21	and over a morsel of bread, a strong man will do wrong. 
PRO.28.22	He who hurries for wealth is a man with an evil eye,
PRO.28.22	but he does not know that poverty will come upon him. 
PRO.28.23	He who rebukes a person will afterward find more favor 
PRO.28.23	than he who flatters with the tongue. 
PRO.28.24	He who robs his father and his mother and says, “There is no crime,” 
PRO.28.24	is partner to a man who corrupts. 
PRO.28.25	The greedy person
PRO.28.25	but he who trusts in Yahweh will be enriched. 
PRO.28.26	He who trusts in his own heart
PRO.28.26	but he who walks in wisdom will be saved. 
PRO.28.27	For he who gives to the poor, there is no lacking, 
PRO.28.27	but for he
PRO.28.28	With the rising of the wicked, humankind will be hidden, 
PRO.28.28	and with their perishing, the righteous will multiply. 
PRO.29.1	 A man who is reproved, being stubborn of neck— 
PRO.29.1	suddenly he will be broken, and there will not be healing. 
PRO.29.2	When the righteous are numerous, the people will rejoice, 
PRO.29.2	but when the wicked are ruling, people will groan. 
PRO.29.3	A man who loves wisdom will make his parents glad, 
PRO.29.3	but the friend of prostitutes
PRO.29.4	By justice a king gives stability to a land, 
PRO.29.4	but a man of bribes will ruin it. 
PRO.29.5	A strong man who flatters his neighbor 
PRO.29.5	is spreading a net for his feet. 
PRO.29.6	In transgression, an evil man is a snare, 
PRO.29.6	but the righteous will sing and rejoice.
PRO.29.7	The righteous knows the case of the poor, 
PRO.29.7	but the wicked does not understand knowledge. 
PRO.29.8	Men of scoffing set a city aflame, 
PRO.29.8	but the wise turn away wrath. 
PRO.29.9	If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man, 
PRO.29.9	then there is rankling and ridicule,
PRO.29.10	Men of blood hate the blameless, 
PRO.29.10	and they seek the life of the upright.
PRO.29.11	A fool gives all his breath,
PRO.29.11	but the wise holds back in quiet. 
PRO.29.12	A ruler listening to a word of falsehood, 
PRO.29.12	all his officials are wicked. 
PRO.29.13	The poor and a man of oppression have this in common: 
PRO.29.13	Yahweh gives light to the eyes of them both.
PRO.29.14	A king who judges with truthfulness to the poor, 
PRO.29.14	his throne will be established forever. 
PRO.29.15	As for a rod and reproof, they
PRO.29.15	but a neglected child is disgraced by his mother. 
PRO.29.16	With the increase of the wicked, transgression will increase, 
PRO.29.16	but the righteous will look on his downfall. 
PRO.29.17	Discipline your children, and they will give you rest, 
PRO.29.17	and they will give delight to your soul.
PRO.29.18	When there is no prophecy, the people cast off restraint, 
PRO.29.18	but as for he who guards instruction, happiness is his. 
PRO.29.19	By words, a servant is not disciplined, 
PRO.29.19	for he will understand, but there is no giving heed. 
PRO.29.20	You see a man who is hasty in his words: 
PRO.29.20	there is more hope for a fool than him. 
PRO.29.21	He who pampers his servant from childhood, 
PRO.29.21	arrogance will be his end.
PRO.29.22	A man of anger will stir strife, 
PRO.29.22	and the owner of anger, much transgression. 
PRO.29.23	The pride of a person will bring him humiliation, 
PRO.29.23	and the lowly of spirit will obtain honor. 
PRO.29.24	Being a partner with a thief is hating one’s life;
PRO.29.24	a curse he will hear, but not disclose. 
PRO.29.25	The fear of a person will lay a snare, 
PRO.29.25	but he who trusts in Yahweh will be secure. 
PRO.29.26	Many are those who seek the favor
PRO.29.26	but from Yahweh one obtains justice.
PRO.29.27	A man of injustice is an abomination to the righteous, 
PRO.29.27	but the upright
PRO.30.1	The words of Agur, son of Yakeh, the oracle. 
PRO.30.1	Thus says the man to Ithiel, to Ithiel, and Ucal:
PRO.30.2	Certainly I am more stupid than a man, 
PRO.30.2	and the understanding of humankind is not for me. 
PRO.30.3	And I have not learned wisdom, 
PRO.30.3	nor will I know knowledge of the Holy One.
PRO.30.4	Who has ascended to heaven and come down? 
PRO.30.4	Who has gathered the wind in the hollow of his hand? 
PRO.30.4	Who has wrapped water in a
PRO.30.4	Who has established all the ends of the earth? 
PRO.30.4	What is his name and what is the name of his child? 
PRO.30.4	For surely you know. 
PRO.30.5	Every word of God is flawless; 
PRO.30.5	he is a shield for him who takes refuge in him. 
PRO.30.6	Do not add to his words 
PRO.30.6	lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar. 
PRO.30.7	Two things I ask from you; 
PRO.30.7	do not deny me before I die: 
PRO.30.8	Keep falsehood and a lying word
PRO.30.8	do not give me poverty or wealth; 
PRO.30.8	provide me with food only for my need. 
PRO.30.9	Or else I will be satisfied and will deny him 
PRO.30.9	and say “Who is Yahweh?” 
PRO.30.9	Or
PRO.30.9	and profane the name of my God. 
PRO.30.10	Do not slander a servant to his master, 
PRO.30.10	or else he will curse you and you will be guilty. 
PRO.30.11	There is a generation that will curse its father, 
PRO.30.11	and its mother it will not bless. 
PRO.30.12	There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes, 
PRO.30.12	but from its filthiness it will not be cleansed. 
PRO.30.13	There is a generation—how lofty are their eyes! 
PRO.30.13	And their eyelids they will lift. 
PRO.30.14	There is a generation whose teeth are swords, 
PRO.30.14	and its jawbones, knives, 
PRO.30.14	in order to devour the poor from the earth
PRO.30.14	and the needy from humankind. 
PRO.30.15	For the leech, there are two daughters; 
PRO.30.15	“Give, give!” they cry. 
PRO.30.15	As for three of these, they are not satisfied; 
PRO.30.15	as for four, they do not say enough. 
PRO.30.16	Sheol
PRO.30.16	the land is not satisfied with water, 
PRO.30.16	and fire does not say “enough!” 
PRO.30.17	The eye that mocks a father 
PRO.30.17	and scorns the obedience of a mother— 
PRO.30.17	the ravens of the valley will peck it out, 
PRO.30.17	and the offspring of vultures will eat it. 
PRO.30.18	Three of these are too wonderful for me, 
PRO.30.18	and four, I do not understand them: 
PRO.30.19	the way of the eagle in the sky, 
PRO.30.19	the way of a snake on a rock, 
PRO.30.19	the way of a ship in the heart of the sea, 
PRO.30.19	and the way of a man with a young woman. 
PRO.30.20	This is the way of a woman committing adultery: 
PRO.30.20	she eats and wipes her mouth, 
PRO.30.20	and says “I have not done wrong.” 
PRO.30.21	Under three things the earth
PRO.30.21	and under four, it is not able to bear up: 
PRO.30.22	under a slave when he becomes king, 
PRO.30.22	and a fool when he is satisfied with food; 
PRO.30.23	under an unloved woman when she gets married, 
PRO.30.23	and a maid when she succeeds her mistress. 
PRO.30.24	There are four small things on the earth, 
PRO.30.24	and they are exceedingly wise:
PRO.30.25	The ants are a people who are not strong, 
PRO.30.25	yet they prepare their food in the summer; 
PRO.30.26	the badgers are a people who are not mighty, 
PRO.30.26	yet they set their house on the rock; 
PRO.30.27	there is no king for the locust, 
PRO.30.27	yet it marches in rank; 
PRO.30.28	a lizard you can seize with hands, 
PRO.30.28	yet it is in palaces of kings. 
PRO.30.29	There are three things that are magnificent of stride, 
PRO.30.29	and four that are magnificent when moving: 
PRO.30.30	a mighty lion among the beasts,
PRO.30.30	but he will not turn back from any face;
PRO.30.31	a strutting rooster or he-goat, 
PRO.30.31	and a king whose army is with him. 
PRO.30.32	If you have been foolish by exalting yourself, 
PRO.30.32	and if you have devised evil, put your hand to your mouth. 
PRO.30.33	For pressing milk produces curd, 
PRO.30.33	and pressing the nose produces blood, 
PRO.30.33	so pressing anger
PRO.31.1	The words of Lemuel, the king—an oracle 
PRO.31.1	that his mother taught him: 
PRO.31.2	What, my son? And what, my son in my womb? 
PRO.31.2	And what, son of my vows? 
PRO.31.3	Do not give your strength to the women, 
PRO.31.3	and your ways to destroy kings. 
PRO.31.4	It is not for the kings, O Lemuel; 
PRO.31.4	drinking wine is not for the kings, 
PRO.31.4	nor is strong drink for rulers. 
PRO.31.5	Or else he will drink and forget what has been decreed, 
PRO.31.5	and he will pervert the rights
PRO.31.6	Give strong drink to him who is perishing, 
PRO.31.6	and wine to those in bitter distress.
PRO.31.7	He will drink and forget his poverty, 
PRO.31.7	and his misery he will not remember any more. 
PRO.31.8	Open your mouth for the mute, 
PRO.31.8	for the rights
PRO.31.9	Open your mouth, judge righteousness, 
PRO.31.9	and defend the poor and needy. 
PRO.31.10	A woman
PRO.31.10	For her worth is far more than precious jewels. 
PRO.31.11	The heart of her husband
PRO.31.11	and gain he will not lack. 
PRO.31.12	She does him good, but not harm 
PRO.31.12	all the days of her life. 
PRO.31.13	She seeks wool and flax, 
PRO.31.13	and she works with the diligence of her hands.
PRO.31.14	She is like the ships of a merchant; 
PRO.31.14	from far off she brings her food;
PRO.31.15	And she arises while it is still night, 
PRO.31.15	and gives food to her household, 
PRO.31.15	and tasks to her servant girls. 
PRO.31.16	She considers a field and buys it, 
PRO.31.16	from the fruit of her hand
PRO.31.17	She girds her waist in strength, 
PRO.31.17	and makes her arms strong. 
PRO.31.18	She perceives that her merchandise is good; 
PRO.31.18	her lamp does not go out in the night. 
PRO.31.19	Her hands she puts onto the distaff,
PRO.31.19	and her palms hold a spindle. 
PRO.31.20	Her palm she opens to the poor, 
PRO.31.20	and her hand she reaches out to the needy. 
PRO.31.21	She does not fear for her house when it snows, 
PRO.31.21	for her entire household
PRO.31.22	She makes for herself coverings; 
PRO.31.22	her clothing is fine linen and purple. 
PRO.31.23	Her husband
PRO.31.23	in his seat among the elders of the land. 
PRO.31.24	Linen garments she makes and sells, 
PRO.31.24	and she supplies sashes for the merchants. 
PRO.31.25	Strength and dignity are her clothing, 
PRO.31.25	and she laughs at the future.
PRO.31.26	She opens her mouth with wisdom, 
PRO.31.26	and instruction of kindness is upon her tongue. 
PRO.31.27	She looks after the ways of her household, 
PRO.31.27	and the bread of idleness she will not eat. 
PRO.31.28	Her children rise and consider her happy, 
PRO.31.28	her husband
PRO.31.29	“Many daughters have done excellence,
PRO.31.29	but you surpass
PRO.31.30	Charm
PRO.31.30	but a woman who fears Yahweh shall be praised. 
PRO.31.31	Give to her from the fruit of her hand, 
PRO.31.31	and may they praise her works in the city gates. 
ECC.1.1	The words of the Teacher,
ECC.1.2	“Vanity of vanities!” says the Teacher,
ECC.1.2	“Vanity of vanities! All is vanity!” 
ECC.1.3	What does a person gain in all his toil 
ECC.1.3	with which he toils under the sun? 
ECC.1.4	A generation goes, and a generation comes, 
ECC.1.4	but the earth stands forever. 
ECC.1.5	The sun rises, and the sun goes down; 
ECC.1.5	to its place it hurries,
ECC.1.6	The wind goes to the south and goes around to the north; 
ECC.1.6	around and around it goes, and on its circuit the wind returns. 
ECC.1.7	All the streams flow to the sea, 
ECC.1.7	but the sea is never full; 
ECC.1.7	to the place where the streams flow, 
ECC.1.7	there they continue to flow. 
ECC.1.8	All things toil continuously;
ECC.1.8	no one can ever finish describing this.
ECC.1.8	The eye is never
ECC.1.8	and the ear is never
ECC.1.9	What has been—it is what will be; 
ECC.1.9	what has been done—it is what will be done; 
ECC.1.9	there is nothing new under the sun. 
ECC.1.10	There is a thing of which it is said, “Look at this! This is new!” 
ECC.1.10	But it already existed in ages past before us. 
ECC.1.11	There is neither remembrance of former generations, 
ECC.1.11	nor will there be remembrance of future generations. 
ECC.1.12	I, the Teacher,
ECC.1.13	I applied my mind to seek and to search by wisdom all that is done under the heavens.
ECC.1.14	I saw all the works that are done under the sun. Look! Everything is vanity and chasing wind. 
ECC.1.15	What is twisted cannot be straightened,
ECC.1.15	and what is lacking cannot be counted.
ECC.1.16	I said to myself,
ECC.1.17	So I dedicated myself
ECC.1.18	For in much wisdom is much frustration,
ECC.1.18	and whoever increases knowledge increases sorrow. 
ECC.2.1	I said to myself,
ECC.2.2	I said of laughter, “It is folly!” and of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?”
ECC.2.3	I also explored
ECC.2.4	I accomplished great things.
ECC.2.5	I made for myself gardens and parks, and I planted all sorts of fruit trees in them. 
ECC.2.6	I made for myself pools of water from which to irrigate a grove of flourishing trees. 
ECC.2.7	I acquired male slaves and female slaves, as well as children born in my house. I also had livestock, cattle, and flocks more than anyone who was before me in Jerusalem. 
ECC.2.8	I also gathered to myself silver and gold—the royal and provincial treasuries. I acquired for myself male and female singers, as well as the delight of men,
ECC.2.9	Thus, I accomplished far more
ECC.2.10	I neither withheld anything from my eyes that they desired, nor did I deprive any pleasure from my heart. My heart rejoiced in all my toil, for this was my reward from all my toil. 
ECC.2.11	Yet when I considered
ECC.2.12	Next, I considered wisdom, as well as delusion and folly. What can anyone do who will come after the king that has not already been done? 
ECC.2.13	I realized that wisdom has an advantage over folly, just as light has an advantage over darkness. 
ECC.2.14	The wise man can see where he is walking,
ECC.2.15	So I said to myself,
ECC.2.16	Certainly no one will remember the wise man or the fool in future generations.
ECC.2.17	So I hated life because the work done under the sun is grievous to me. For everything is vanity and chasing wind! 
ECC.2.18	So I hated all my toil with which I have toiled under the sun, for I must leave it behind to someone who will be after me. 
ECC.2.19	And who knows whether he will be wise or foolish? Yet he will exercise control of all the fruit of my toil with which I toiled wisely under the sun. This also is vanity! 
ECC.2.20	So I began to despair
ECC.2.21	For although a person may toil with great wisdom and skill, he must leave his reward to someone who has not toiled for it. This also is vanity and a great calamity. 
ECC.2.22	For what does a person receive for all his toil and in the longing of his heart with which he toils under the sun? 
ECC.2.23	All his days are painful, his labor brings grief, and his heart cannot rest at night. This also is vanity! 
ECC.2.24	There is nothing better for a person than to eat and drink and find delight
ECC.2.25	For who can eat and drink, and who can enjoy life apart from him?
ECC.2.26	For to the person who is good in his eyes, he gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and heaping up only to give it to him who is pleasing to him. This also is vanity and chasing wind! 
ECC.3.1	For everything there is an appointed time, a time for every matter under heaven: 
ECC.3.2	a time to bear
ECC.3.2	a time to plant and a time to root up what is planted; 
ECC.3.3	a time to kill and a time to heal; 
ECC.3.3	a time to break down and a time to build up; 
ECC.3.4	a time to weep and a time to laugh; 
ECC.3.4	a time to mourn and a time to dance; 
ECC.3.5	a time to throw away stones and a time to gather stones; 
ECC.3.5	a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing; 
ECC.3.6	a time to seek and a time to lose; 
ECC.3.6	a time to keep and a time to throw away; 
ECC.3.7	a time to tear and a time to sew; 
ECC.3.7	a time to be silent and a time to speak; 
ECC.3.8	a time to love and a time to hate; 
ECC.3.8	a time for war and a time for peace. 
ECC.3.9	What does the worker gain in his toil? 
ECC.3.10	I have seen the busyness God gives to humans
ECC.3.11	He has made everything suitable in its time. He also has put the past
ECC.3.12	So I realized that there is nothing better
ECC.3.13	And for anyone to eat and drink, that is, to enjoy the fruit of all his toil,
ECC.3.14	I know everything God does endures forever; 
ECC.3.14	nothing can be added to it, and nothing can be taken from it, 
ECC.3.14	for God so acts that humans
ECC.3.15	What is—it already was, 
ECC.3.15	and what will be—it already is, 
ECC.3.15	for God will do what he has done.
ECC.3.16	I saw something else under the sun: instead of justice there was evil; instead of righteousness there was wickedness. 
ECC.3.17	So I said to myself,
ECC.3.18	I said to myself concerning humans,
ECC.3.19	For the fate of humans
ECC.3.20	Both go to one place—both came from dust and both return to dust. 
ECC.3.21	For no one knows whether the spirit of a human ascends to heaven and whether the spirit of the beast descends to the ground! 
ECC.3.22	So I concluded that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy the fruit of his labor, for this is his lot in life. For no one knows what will happen in the future.
ECC.4.1	I looked again, and I saw all the oppression that occurs under the sun. 
ECC.4.1	I saw the tears of the oppressed— 
ECC.4.1	no one comforts them! 
ECC.4.1	Those who oppress them are powerful— 
ECC.4.1	no one can comfort them!
ECC.4.2	So I deemed the dead who have already died 
ECC.4.2	more fortunate than the living who are still alive. 
ECC.4.3	But better off than both of them is the one who has not yet been born 
ECC.4.3	and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun. 
ECC.4.4	I also realized that all of the toil and all of the skillful work that is done—it is envy between one man and another.
ECC.4.5	The fool refuses to work with his hands, 
ECC.4.5	so he has nothing to eat except his own skin!
ECC.4.6	Better is one handful with peace 
ECC.4.6	than two fists full with toil and chasing wind. 
ECC.4.7	I turned again and saw another vanity under the sun. 
ECC.4.8	Sometimes a man is all alone with no companion; he also has neither son nor brother. Yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eye is not satisfied with wealth. He laments, “For whom am I toiling and depriving myself
ECC.4.9	Two are better than the one, for they enjoy a better reward for their toil. 
ECC.4.10	For if one falls, his companion may help him up. But pity the one who falls and there is no one
ECC.4.11	Also if two lie together, they can keep each other warm.
ECC.4.12	Although an assailant may overpower one person, two may withstand him.
ECC.4.13	A poor but wise youth is better than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to receive advice.
ECC.4.14	For he came out of the prison house to reign, since he was born poor in his kingdom.
ECC.4.15	I saw all the living who move about under the sun with the youth; the second who will stand in his place. 
ECC.4.16	There is no end to all the people, to all who were before him. Yet the later generation will not rejoice in him, for this also is vanity and chasing wind! 
ECC.5.1	 Guard your steps when you go to the house of God; 
ECC.5.1	draw near to listen rather than to offer a sacrifice of fools, 
ECC.5.1	for they do not know that they are doing evil. 
ECC.5.2	Do not be rash with your mouth, 
ECC.5.2	and do not let your heart be quick to utter a word before God. 
ECC.5.2	For God is in heaven, and you are on earth; 
ECC.5.2	therefore, let your words be few. 
ECC.5.3	For a dream comes with many cares, 
ECC.5.3	and the voice of a fool with many words. 
ECC.5.4	When you make a vow to God, 
ECC.5.4	do not delay in fulfilling it, 
ECC.5.4	for he takes no pleasure
ECC.5.4	Fulfill what you vow! 
ECC.5.5	It is better that you not vow 
ECC.5.5	than that you vow and not fulfill it. 
ECC.5.6	Do not let your mouth lead your flesh into sin, 
ECC.5.6	and do not tell the messenger that it was a mistake. 
ECC.5.6	Why anger God at your words, 
ECC.5.6	so that he destroys the work of your hands? 
ECC.5.7	For with many dreams come vanities and numerous words. 
ECC.5.7	Therefore, fear God! 
ECC.5.8	Do not be surprised if you see the poor being oppressed with violence 
ECC.5.8	or do not see justice and righteousness in the province. 
ECC.5.8	For one official is watched by a higher official, 
ECC.5.8	and there are even higher officials over them! 
ECC.5.9	The produce of the land is exploited by everyone; 
ECC.5.9	even the king profits from the field of the poor!
ECC.5.10	Whoever loves money is not satisfied with money, 
ECC.5.10	and whoever loves wealth is not satisfied with profit. 
ECC.5.10	This also is vanity! 
ECC.5.11	When prosperity increases, 
ECC.5.11	those who consume it increase. 
ECC.5.11	So its owner gains nothing, 
ECC.5.11	except to see his wealth before it is spent.
ECC.5.12	The sleep of the laborer is pleasant, whether he eats little or much, 
ECC.5.12	but the wealth of the rich man does not allow him to rest. 
ECC.5.13	There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: wealth hoarded
ECC.5.14	That wealth was lost in a bad venture. Although he has borne a child, he has nothing to leave to him.
ECC.5.15	Just as he came from his mother’s womb naked, he will depart
ECC.5.16	This also is a grievous illness. Exactly as he came, so he will go. What profit does he gain for all his toil for the wind? 
ECC.5.17	Also, he eats in darkness all his days; he is frustrated in much sickness and resentment. 
ECC.5.18	Look! I have discovered what is good and fitting: to eat and to drink and to enjoy
ECC.5.19	This indeed is a gift of God: everyone to whom God gives wealth and possessions, he also empowers him to enjoy them,
ECC.5.20	For he does not remember the brief days of his life, for God keeps his heart preoccupied with enjoyment of life. 
ECC.6.1	Here is another misfortune that I have seen under the sun, and it is prevalent among humankind. 
ECC.6.2	God gives a man wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires; yet God does not enable him to enjoy it—instead someone else ends up enjoying it. This is vanity—indeed, it is a grievous ill! 
ECC.6.3	Even if a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years so that the days of his years are many, if his heart
ECC.6.4	For he comes into vanity and departs into darkness, and his name is shrouded in darkness. 
ECC.6.5	He has neither seen nor known the sun, yet he has more rest than him. 
ECC.6.6	Even if a man
ECC.6.7	All of a man’s toil is for his mouth— 
ECC.6.7	yet his appetite is never satisfied. 
ECC.6.8	So do the wise really have an advantage over fools? 
ECC.6.8	Can the poor really gain anything by knowing how to act in front of others?
ECC.6.9	Better to be content with what your eyes see 
ECC.6.9	than for your soul to constantly crave more.
ECC.6.9	This also is vanity and chasing wind! 
ECC.6.10	Whatever is—it was already determined, 
ECC.6.10	what will be—it has already been decided.
ECC.6.10	As for man, he cannot argue 
ECC.6.10	against what is more powerful than him. 
ECC.6.11	Increasing words only multiplies futility,
ECC.6.11	how does that profit anyone? 
ECC.6.12	For who knows what is good for a man in his life during the few days of his fleeting life, which are fleeting as a shadow? For who can tell anyone what will happen in the future
ECC.7.1	A good name is better than precious ointment, 
ECC.7.1	and the day of death is better than the day of one’s birth. 
ECC.7.2	Better to go to the house of mourning 
ECC.7.2	than to go to the house of feasting, 
ECC.7.2	for death is the end of every person, 
ECC.7.2	and the living should take it to his heart. 
ECC.7.3	Sorrow is better than laughter, 
ECC.7.3	for by sadness of countenance the heart is made good. 
ECC.7.4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, 
ECC.7.4	but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. 
ECC.7.5	Better to listen to the rebuke of the wise 
ECC.7.5	than for a man to listen to the song of fools. 
ECC.7.6	Like the sound of thorns under a pot, 
ECC.7.6	so also the laughter of fools. 
ECC.7.6	This also is vanity! 
ECC.7.7	Surely oppression makes a fool of the wise, 
ECC.7.7	and a bribe corrupts the heart. 
ECC.7.8	The end of a matter is better than its beginning; 
ECC.7.8	better to be slow to anger than hot-headed.
ECC.7.9	Do not be quick in your spirit to anger, 
ECC.7.9	for anger lodges in the bosom of fools. 
ECC.7.10	Do not say, “Why were the former days better than these?” 
ECC.7.10	For it is not from wisdom that you ask this. 
ECC.7.11	Wisdom is good with an inheritance; 
ECC.7.11	it benefits the living.
ECC.7.12	For wisdom offers protection like money offers protection.
ECC.7.12	But knowledge has an advantage—wisdom restores life to its possessor. 
ECC.7.13	Consider the work of God. 
ECC.7.13	For who is able to make straight what he made crooked? 
ECC.7.14	In the day of prosperity, rejoice! 
ECC.7.14	But in the day of adversity, consider! 
ECC.7.14	For God made one in place of another 
ECC.7.14	so that mortals cannot find out what will happen in the future.
ECC.7.15	I have seen all these things in my vain life: 
ECC.7.15	Sometimes a righteous man perishes in spite of his righteousness, 
ECC.7.15	and sometimes a wicked man lives a long life in spite of his evil. 
ECC.7.16	Do not be excessively
ECC.7.16	and do not act excessively wise, lest you destroy yourself. 
ECC.7.17	Do not act excessively wicked, 
ECC.7.17	and do not be a fool, lest you die before your time. 
ECC.7.18	It is good to take hold of the one and also must not let go of the other; 
ECC.7.18	for whoever fears God will hold both of them secure. 
ECC.7.19	Wisdom gives more strength to the wise 
ECC.7.19	than ten rulers who are in the city. 
ECC.7.20	Surely there is no one righteous on the earth 
ECC.7.20	who continually does good and never sins. 
ECC.7.21	Do not pay attention to everything people say, 
ECC.7.21	lest you hear your own servant curse you. 
ECC.7.22	For your heart knows 
ECC.7.22	that you also have cursed others many times. 
ECC.7.23	All this I have tested with wisdom. I said, “I will be wise!” but it was beyond my grasp.
ECC.7.24	Whatever is—it is far beyond comprehension.
ECC.7.25	I set my mind to try to seek wisdom and the plan, and to know that wickedness is foolishness and that folly is delusion. 
ECC.7.26	I myself found that more bitter than death is the woman who is a trap, whose heart is a snare, and whose hands are bonds. The one who pleases God escapes from her, but the sinner is caught by her. 
ECC.7.27	“Look! I found this,” said the Teacher,
ECC.7.28	What my heart sought, I did not find. Although I found one righteous man among one thousand, I did not find one upright woman among all these. 
ECC.7.29	Look! This alone I found: God made mankind upright, but they have devised many schemes.” 
ECC.8.1	Who is like the sage? 
ECC.8.1	Who knows the interpretation of a thing? 
ECC.8.1	A man’s wisdom makes his face shine, 
ECC.8.1	and the hardness of his face is changed. 
ECC.8.2	Keep the command of the king
ECC.8.2	because of your oath to God.
ECC.8.3	Do not be terrified of his presence! 
ECC.8.3	Go at once and do not delay when a matter is unpleasant, 
ECC.8.3	for he can do anything that he desires. 
ECC.8.4	Since the word of the king is supreme, 
ECC.8.4	no one can say to him, “What are you doing?” 
ECC.8.5	Whoever obeys his command will not suffer disaster. 
ECC.8.5	The wise mind knows the proper time and the right procedure. 
ECC.8.6	For there is a proper time and right procedure for every matter, 
ECC.8.6	even though the trouble of man weighs heavy upon him. 
ECC.8.7	Surely no one knows what will be, 
ECC.8.7	so who can tell anyone what will happen? 
ECC.8.8	Just as no one can control the wind to restrain the wind, 
ECC.8.8	so also no one can control the day of his death. 
ECC.8.8	Just as no one is discharged in time of war, 
ECC.8.8	so wickedness will not deliver the wicked. 
ECC.8.9	I saw all this as I applied my heart to all the deeds done under the sun: sometimes those in authority harm others.
ECC.8.10	Meanwhile, I saw the wicked being honorably buried, but those who came and went from the holy place were forgotten in the city, even though they had done so. This also is vanity! 
ECC.8.11	Because sentence against an evil deed is not carried out quickly, the heart of humans
ECC.8.12	Although the sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I also know that it will be good for those who fear God—because they fear his presence.
ECC.8.13	But it will not go well with the wicked, and they will not prolong their days, like the shadow; because there is no fearing God’s presence.
ECC.8.14	There is a vanity that happens on earth: sometimes the righteous suffer what the wicked deserve, and sometimes the wicked receive what the righteous deserve. I said, “This also is vanity!” 
ECC.8.15	So I recommend enjoyment. For there is nothing better for man under the sun than to eat and to drink and to rejoice. This will accompany him in his toil the days of his life that God gives to him under the sun. 
ECC.8.16	I applied my mind to know wisdom and to understand the business that is done on earth—how neither day nor night one’s eyes see sleep. 
ECC.8.17	Then I saw all the work of God—man is not able to discover the work that is done under the sun. Although man may toil in seeking, he cannot find it. Even if a wise man claims that he knows it, he cannot find it. 
ECC.9.1	So all this I laid to my heart, and I concluded
ECC.9.2	The same fate comes to everyone: 
ECC.9.2	to the righteous and to the wicked, 
ECC.9.2	to the good and to the wicked,
ECC.9.2	to the clean and to the unclean, 
ECC.9.2	to those who sacrifice and to those who do not sacrifice. 
ECC.9.2	As with the good man, so also to the sinner; 
ECC.9.2	as with those who swear an oath, so also those who fear oaths. 
ECC.9.3	This is the injustice
ECC.9.3	the same fate comes to everyone. 
ECC.9.3	Also the hearts of humans
ECC.9.3	delusion is in their hearts during their lives, and then they die. 
ECC.9.4	Whoever is joined
ECC.9.5	For the living know that they will die, but the dead do not know anything. They no longer have a reward, and even the memory of them is forgotten. 
ECC.9.6	What they loved and hated, as well as what they desired, has already perished. They no longer have any share in what is done under the sun. 
ECC.9.7	Go—eat your food with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart! For God already has approved your deeds. 
ECC.9.8	Always be clothed in white garments, and never let your head lack oil! 
ECC.9.9	Enjoy life with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which he gives you under the sun, because this is your lot in life and in the toil with which you toil under the sun. 
ECC.9.10	Whatever your hand finds to do—do it with all your might; for in Sheol—where you are going—no one works, plans, knows, or thinks about anything. 
ECC.9.11	I looked again and saw under the sun that the race does not belong to the swift, the battle does not belong to the mighty, food does not belong to the wise, wealth does not belong to the intelligent, and success
ECC.9.12	For man does not know his time. Just as fish are caught in a cruel net and like birds who are seized in a snare, so also humans
ECC.9.13	I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me. 
ECC.9.14	There was a small city with few people in it. A great king came and besieged it, building great siege works against it. 
ECC.9.15	Now, a poor wise man was found in it, and he delivered the city by his wisdom. 
ECC.9.16	So I concluded that wisdom is better than might, yet the wisdom of the poor is despised, and his words are not heard. 
ECC.9.17	The words of the wise are heard in peace 
ECC.9.17	more than the shouting of a ruler is heard among the fools. 
ECC.9.18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war, 
ECC.9.18	but one sinner destroys much good. 
ECC.10.1	 Dead flies cause a bad smell and ruin
ECC.10.1	So also a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. 
ECC.10.2	The heart of the wise inclines to his right, 
ECC.10.2	but the heart of the fool inclines to his left. 
ECC.10.3	Even when the fool walks along the road, he lacks sense; 
ECC.10.3	he tells everyone that he is a fool. 
ECC.10.4	If the anger of the ruler rises against you, 
ECC.10.4	do not leave your post, 
ECC.10.4	for calmness can undo great offenses. 
ECC.10.5	There is an evil I have seen under the sun— 
ECC.10.5	it is an error that proceeds from a ruler! 
ECC.10.6	The fool is set in many high places, 
ECC.10.6	but the rich sit in lowly places. 
ECC.10.7	I have even seen slaves riding on horses 
ECC.10.7	and princes walking like slaves on the earth! 
ECC.10.8	Whoever digs a pit will fall into it. 
ECC.10.8	Whoever breaks through a wall, a snake will bite him. 
ECC.10.9	Whoever quarries
ECC.10.9	Whoever splits logs will be endangered by them. 
ECC.10.10	If the ax is blunt but one does not sharpen its edge, 
ECC.10.10	he must exert more effort,
ECC.10.10	but the advantage of wisdom is it brings success. 
ECC.10.11	If the snake bites before the charming, 
ECC.10.11	the snake charmer will not succeed.
ECC.10.12	The wise man wins favor by the words of his mouth, 
ECC.10.12	but the fool is devoured by his own lips. 
ECC.10.13	He begins by saying what is foolish 
ECC.10.13	and ends by uttering what is wicked delusion. 
ECC.10.14	The fool talks too much,
ECC.10.14	for no one knows what will be. 
ECC.10.14	Who can tell anyone what will happen in the future?
ECC.10.15	The fool is so worn out by a hard day’s work 
ECC.10.15	he cannot even find his way home at night.
ECC.10.16	Woe to you, O land, when your king is a youth 
ECC.10.16	and your princes feast in the morning. 
ECC.10.17	Blessed are you, O land, when your king is a son of nobility 
ECC.10.17	and your princes feast at the proper time— 
ECC.10.17	to gain strength and not to get drunk. 
ECC.10.18	Through sloth the roof sinks in, 
ECC.10.18	and through idleness of hands the house leaks. 
ECC.10.19	Feasts are held for celebration,
ECC.10.19	wine cheers the living, 
ECC.10.19	and money answers everything. 
ECC.10.20	Do not curse the king even in your thoughts, 
ECC.10.20	and do not curse the rich even in your own bedroom, 
ECC.10.20	for a bird of the sky may carry your voice; 
ECC.10.20	a winged messenger may repeat your words. 
ECC.11.1	Send out your bread on the water, 
ECC.11.1	for in many days you will find it. 
ECC.11.2	Divide your share in seven or in eight, 
ECC.11.2	for you do not know what disaster will happen on the earth. 
ECC.11.3	When the clouds are full, 
ECC.11.3	they empty rain on the earth. 
ECC.11.3	Whether a tree falls to the south or whether it falls to the north, 
ECC.11.3	the place where the tree falls—there it will be. 
ECC.11.4	Whoever watches the wind will not sow; 
ECC.11.4	whoever watches the clouds will not reap. 
ECC.11.5	Just as you do not know how the path of the wind
ECC.11.5	nor how the bones of a fetus form in a mother’s womb, 
ECC.11.5	so you do not know the work of God who makes everything. 
ECC.11.6	Sow your seed in the morning, 
ECC.11.6	and do not let your hands rest in the evening, 
ECC.11.6	for you do not know what will prosper— 
ECC.11.6	whether this or that, or whether both of them alike will succeed. 
ECC.11.7	The light is sweet, 
ECC.11.7	and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun. 
ECC.11.8	For if a man lives many years, 
ECC.11.8	let him rejoice in all of them! 
ECC.11.8	Let him remember that the days of the darkness will be many— 
ECC.11.8	all that is coming is vanity! 
ECC.11.9	Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, 
ECC.11.9	and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth! 
ECC.11.9	Follow the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes— 
ECC.11.9	but know that God will bring you into judgment for all these things. 
ECC.11.10	Banish anxiety from your heart, 
ECC.11.10	and put away pain from your body, 
ECC.11.10	for youth and vigor are vanity. 
ECC.12.1	Remember your Creator in the days of your youth— 
ECC.12.1	before the days of trouble come 
ECC.12.1	and the years draw near when you will say, 
ECC.12.1	“I find no pleasure in them!” 
ECC.12.2	Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars darken 
ECC.12.2	and the clouds return after the rain. 
ECC.12.3	When the guards of the house tremble, 
ECC.12.3	and the men of strength are bent; 
ECC.12.3	the grinders cease because they are few, 
ECC.12.3	and those looking through the windows see dimly. 
ECC.12.4	When the doors on the street are shut, 
ECC.12.4	when the sound of the grinding mill is low; 
ECC.12.4	one rises up to the sound of the bird, 
ECC.12.4	and all the daughters of song are brought low. 
ECC.12.5	They are afraid of heights, 
ECC.12.5	and terrors are on the road. 
ECC.12.5	The almond tree blossoms, 
ECC.12.5	and the grasshopper draws itself along, and desire fails 
ECC.12.5	because man goes to his eternal home, 
ECC.12.5	and the mourners go about in the streets. 
ECC.12.6	Before the silver cord is snapped 
ECC.12.6	and the golden bowl is broken; 
ECC.12.6	and the jar at the foundation is broken, 
ECC.12.6	and the wheel at the cistern is broken. 
ECC.12.7	And the dust returns to the earth as it was, 
ECC.12.7	and the breath returns to God who gave it. 
ECC.12.8	“Vanity of vanity!” says the Teacher.
ECC.12.8	“Everything is vanity!” 
ECC.12.9	The Teacher
ECC.12.10	The Teacher
ECC.12.11	The words of the wise are like cattle goads; the collections of the sages are like pricks inflicted by one shepherd.
ECC.12.12	My son, be careful about anything beyond these things.
ECC.12.13	Now that all has been heard, here is the final conclusion: 
ECC.12.13	Fear God and obey his commandments, 
ECC.12.13	for this is the whole duty of man. 
ECC.12.14	For God will bring every deed into judgment, 
ECC.12.14	including every secret thing, whether good or evil. 
SNG.1.1	The Song of Songs,
SNG.1.2	May
SNG.1.2	for your love is better than wine.
SNG.1.3	As fragrance, your perfumes
SNG.1.3	your name is poured out perfume;
SNG.1.3	therefore young women love you. 
SNG.1.4	Draw me after you, let us run! 
SNG.1.4	May the king bring me into his chambers!
SNG.1.4	Let us be joyful and let us rejoice in you; 
SNG.1.4	let us extol your love more than wine. 
SNG.1.4	Rightly do they love you! 
SNG.1.5	I am black but beautiful,
SNG.1.5	like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. 
SNG.1.6	Do not gaze at me because I am black, 
SNG.1.6	because the sun has stared at me. 
SNG.1.6	The sons of my mother were angry with me; 
SNG.1.6	they made me keeper of the vineyards, 
SNG.1.6	but my own “vineyard”
SNG.1.7	Tell me, you whom my heart
SNG.1.7	where do you pasture your flock, 
SNG.1.7	where do your sheep lie down at the noon? 
SNG.1.7	For why should I be like
SNG.1.7	beside the flocks of your companions? 
SNG.1.8	If you do not know, O fairest among women, 
SNG.1.8	follow the tracks
SNG.1.8	and pasture your little lambs
SNG.1.9	To a mare
SNG.1.9	I compare you, my beloved. 
SNG.1.10	Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments, 
SNG.1.10	your neck with strings of jewels. 
SNG.1.11	We will make ornaments of gold for you 
SNG.1.11	with studs
SNG.1.12	While the king was on his couch, 
SNG.1.12	my nard gave its fragrance. 
SNG.1.13	My beloved is to me a pouch
SNG.1.13	he spends the night
SNG.1.14	My beloved is to me a cluster of blossoms of henna 
SNG.1.14	in the vineyards of En Gedi. 
SNG.1.15	Look! You are beautiful, my beloved. 
SNG.1.15	Look! You are beautiful; 
SNG.1.15	your eyes are doves. 
SNG.1.16	Look! You are beautiful, my beloved, 
SNG.1.16	truly pleasant. 
SNG.1.16	Truly our couch is verdant;
SNG.1.17	the beams of our house are cedar; 
SNG.1.17	our rafter is cypress. 
SNG.2.1	I am a rose
SNG.2.1	a lily of the valleys. 
SNG.2.2	Like a lily among the thorns,
SNG.2.2	so is my love among the maidens. 
SNG.2.3	As an apple tree among the trees of the forest, 
SNG.2.3	so is my beloved among the young men. 
SNG.2.3	In his shade I sat down with delight,
SNG.2.3	and his fruit was sweet to my palate. 
SNG.2.4	He brought me to the house of the wine, 
SNG.2.4	and his intention was love toward me. 
SNG.2.5	Sustain me with the raisins, 
SNG.2.5	refresh me with the apples, 
SNG.2.5	for I am lovesick.
SNG.2.6	His left hand is under my head, 
SNG.2.6	and his right hand embraces
SNG.2.7	I adjure you, O maidens of Jerusalem,
SNG.2.7	by the gazelles or by the does of the field, 
SNG.2.7	do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases!
SNG.2.8	The voice of my beloved! 
SNG.2.8	Look! Here he
SNG.2.8	bounding over the hills! 
SNG.2.9	My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.
SNG.2.9	Look! He is
SNG.2.9	gazing through
SNG.2.9	looking through
SNG.2.10	My beloved answered and said to me, 
SNG.2.10	“Arise,
SNG.2.11	For look! The winter is over; 
SNG.2.11	the rainy season
SNG.2.12	The blossoms appear
SNG.2.12	the time of singing
SNG.2.12	the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. 
SNG.2.13	The fig tree puts forth her figs, 
SNG.2.13	and the vines are in blossom; they give fragrance. 
SNG.2.13	Arise,
SNG.2.14	My dove, in the clefts of the rock, 
SNG.2.14	in the secluded place
SNG.2.14	Let me see your face, 
SNG.2.14	let me hear your voice; 
SNG.2.14	for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely. 
SNG.2.15	Catch for us the foxes, 
SNG.2.15	the little foxes destroying vineyards, 
SNG.2.15	for
SNG.2.16	My beloved belongs to me and I belong to him;
SNG.2.16	he pastures his flock among the lilies. 
SNG.2.17	Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, 
SNG.2.17	turn, my beloved! 
SNG.2.17	Be like
SNG.3.1	On my bed in the night, 
SNG.3.1	I sought
SNG.3.1	I sought him, but I did not find him. 
SNG.3.2	Now I will arise, and I will go about in the city, 
SNG.3.2	in the streets and in the squares; 
SNG.3.2	I will seek him whom my heart
SNG.3.2	I sought him, but I did not find him. 
SNG.3.3	The sentinels who go about in the city found me. 
SNG.3.3	“Have you seen the one whom my heart
SNG.3.4	Scarcely had I passed
SNG.3.4	when I found him whom my heart
SNG.3.4	I held him and I would not let him go 
SNG.3.4	until I brought him to the house of my mother, 
SNG.3.4	into the bedroom chamber of she who conceived me. 
SNG.3.5	I adjure you, O maidens of Jerusalem,
SNG.3.5	by the gazelles or by the does of the field, 
SNG.3.5	do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases!
SNG.3.6	What is this coming up from the desert 
SNG.3.6	like a column of smoke, 
SNG.3.6	perfumed with myrrh and frankincense 
SNG.3.6	from all the fragrant powders of the merchant? 
SNG.3.7	Look! It is Solomon’s portable couch!
SNG.3.7	Sixty mighty men surround it,
SNG.3.7	the mighty men of Israel. 
SNG.3.8	All of them wield swords;
SNG.3.8	they are trained in warfare,
SNG.3.8	each with his sword at his thigh 
SNG.3.8	to guard against terror
SNG.3.9	King Solomon
SNG.3.9	from the wood of Lebanon. 
SNG.3.10	He made its column of silver, its back
SNG.3.10	its interior is inlaid with leather
SNG.3.11	Come out and look, O maidens of Zion,
SNG.3.11	at the crown with which his mother crowned him 
SNG.3.11	on the day of his wedding, 
SNG.3.11	on the day of the joy of his heart! 
SNG.4.1	Oh my!
SNG.4.1	Oh my!
SNG.4.1	Your eyes are doves 
SNG.4.1	from behind your veil. 
SNG.4.1	Your hair is like a flock of goats 
SNG.4.1	that move down from the mountains of Gilead. 
SNG.4.2	Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes 
SNG.4.2	that came up from the washing, 
SNG.4.2	all of them bearing twins, 
SNG.4.2	and there is none bereaved among them. 
SNG.4.3	Your lips are like a thread of crimson, 
SNG.4.3	and your mouth is lovely. 
SNG.4.3	Your temple is like pomegranate 
SNG.4.3	from behind your veil. 
SNG.4.4	Your neck is like the tower of David, 
SNG.4.4	built in courses; 
SNG.4.4	a thousand ornaments
SNG.4.4	all the shields of the warriors. 
SNG.4.5	Your two breasts are like two fawns, 
SNG.4.5	twins of a gazelle that feed among the lilies. 
SNG.4.6	Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, 
SNG.4.6	I will go to the mountain of the myrrh, 
SNG.4.6	to the hill of the frankincense. 
SNG.4.7	You are completely beautiful, my beloved! 
SNG.4.7	You are flawless!
SNG.4.8	Come
SNG.4.8	Come with me
SNG.4.8	Look from the top of Amana, 
SNG.4.8	from the top of Senir and Hermon, 
SNG.4.8	from the dwelling places of the lions, 
SNG.4.8	from the mountains of leopard. 
SNG.4.9	You have stolen (my) heart, my sister bride! 
SNG.4.9	You have stolen my heart with one glance from your eyes, 
SNG.4.9	with one ornament from your necklaces. 
SNG.4.10	How beautiful is your love, my sister bride! 
SNG.4.10	How better is your love than wine, 
SNG.4.10	and the fragrance of your oils than any spice! 
SNG.4.11	Your lips drip nectar, my bride; 
SNG.4.11	honey and milk are under your lips; 
SNG.4.11	the scent of your garments is like the scent of Lebanon. 
SNG.4.12	A garden locked is my sister bride, 
SNG.4.12	a spring enclosed,
SNG.4.13	Your shoots
SNG.4.13	henna with nard; 
SNG.4.14	nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon spice with all trees of frankincense, 
SNG.4.14	myrrh and aloes with all chief spices. 
SNG.4.15	A garden fountain, a well of living water, 
SNG.4.15	flowing (streams) from Lebanon. 
SNG.4.16	Awake, O north wind! Come, O south wind! 
SNG.4.16	Blow upon my garden! Let its fragrances
SNG.4.16	Let my beloved come to his garden, 
SNG.4.16	let him eat his choice fruit! 
SNG.5.1	 I have come to my garden, my sister bride, 
SNG.5.1	I have gathered my myrrh with my spice, 
SNG.5.1	I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey, 
SNG.5.1	I have drunk my wine with my milk! 
SNG.5.1	Eat, O friends! Drink and become drunk with love!
SNG.5.2	I was asleep but
SNG.5.2	A sound! My beloved knocking!
SNG.5.2	“Open to me, my sister, my beloved, 
SNG.5.2	my dove, my perfect one! 
SNG.5.2	For my head is full of dew, 
SNG.5.2	my hair drenched from the moist night air.”
SNG.5.3	I have taken off my tunic, must I put it on?
SNG.5.3	I have bathed my feet, must I soil them?
SNG.5.4	My beloved thrust his hand into the opening, 
SNG.5.4	and my inmost yearned for him. 
SNG.5.5	I myself arose to open to my beloved; 
SNG.5.5	my hands dripped with myrrh, 
SNG.5.5	my fingers with liquid myrrh 
SNG.5.5	upon the handles of the bolt. 
SNG.5.6	I opened myself to my beloved, 
SNG.5.6	but my beloved had turned and gone;
SNG.5.6	my heart sank
SNG.5.6	I sought him, but I did not find him; 
SNG.5.6	I called him, but he did not answer me. 
SNG.5.7	The sentinels making rounds in the city found me; 
SNG.5.7	they beat me, they wounded me; 
SNG.5.7	they took my cloak
SNG.5.7	those sentinels on the walls!
SNG.5.8	I adjure you, O maidens of Jerusalem,
SNG.5.8	if you find my beloved, what will you tell him? 
SNG.5.8	Tell him that I am lovesick!
SNG.5.9	How is your beloved better than another lover,
SNG.5.9	O most beautiful among women? 
SNG.5.9	How is your beloved better than another lover, 
SNG.5.9	that you adjure us thus? 
SNG.5.10	My beloved is radiant and ruddy,
SNG.5.10	distinguished among
SNG.5.11	His head is gold, refined gold; 
SNG.5.11	his locks are wavy, black as a raven. 
SNG.5.12	His eyes are like doves beside springs
SNG.5.12	bathed in milk, set like mounted jewels.
SNG.5.13	His cheeks are like beds of spice, a tower of fragrances; 
SNG.5.13	his lips are lilies dripping liquid myrrh. 
SNG.5.14	His arms are rods
SNG.5.14	his belly
SNG.5.15	His legs are columns of alabaster,
SNG.5.15	his appearance is like Lebanon, choice as its cedars.
SNG.5.16	His mouth
SNG.5.16	and he is altogether desirable. 
SNG.5.16	This is my beloved; 
SNG.5.16	this is my friend, O young women of Jerusalem.
SNG.6.1	 Where has your beloved gone, 
SNG.6.1	O most beautiful among women? 
SNG.6.1	Where has your beloved turned 
SNG.6.1	that we may seek him with you? 
SNG.6.2	My beloved has gone down to his garden, 
SNG.6.2	to the garden bed of the spice, 
SNG.6.2	to pasture his flock and to gather lilies in the garden. 
SNG.6.3	I belong to my beloved and he belongs to me;
SNG.6.3	he pastures his flock among the lilies. 
SNG.6.4	You are beautiful, my beloved, as Tirzah, 
SNG.6.4	lovely as Jerusalem, 
SNG.6.4	overwhelming as an army with banners.
SNG.6.5	Turn away your eyes from before me, 
SNG.6.5	for they overwhelm me. 
SNG.6.5	Your hair is like a flock of the goats 
SNG.6.5	that moves down from Gilead. 
SNG.6.6	Your teeth are like a flock of the ewes 
SNG.6.6	that have come up from the washing, 
SNG.6.6	all of them bearing twins, 
SNG.6.6	and there is none bereaved among them. 
SNG.6.7	Your cheeks behind
SNG.6.7	are like halves of a pomegranate. 
SNG.6.8	Sixty queens there are, eighty concubines, 
SNG.6.8	and maidens beyond number. 
SNG.6.9	My dove, she is the one;
SNG.6.9	my perfect, she is the only one;
SNG.6.9	she is the favorite of
SNG.6.9	Maidens see her and consider her fortunate;
SNG.6.9	queens and concubines praise her: 
SNG.6.10	“Who is this that looks down like the dawn, 
SNG.6.10	beautiful as the moon, 
SNG.6.10	bright as the sun,
SNG.6.10	overwhelming as an army with banners?”
SNG.6.11	I went down to the orchard of the walnut trees 
SNG.6.11	to look at the blossoms of the valley, 
SNG.6.11	to see whether the vines have sprouted, 
SNG.6.11	whether the pomegranates have blossomed. 
SNG.6.12	I did not know my heart
SNG.6.12	in a chariot of my princely people.
SNG.6.13	 Turn, turn,
SNG.6.13	Turn, turn
SNG.6.13	Why do you look upon the Shulammite 
SNG.6.13	as at a dance of the two armies? 
SNG.7.1	How beautiful are your feet in sandals, 
SNG.7.1	O royal princess!
SNG.7.1	The curves of your thighs
SNG.7.1	the work of the hands of a craftsman. 
SNG.7.2	Your navel is a round wine-mixing bowl
SNG.7.2	that does not lack mixed
SNG.7.2	Your belly is a heap of wheat 
SNG.7.2	encircled with lilies. 
SNG.7.3	Your two breasts are like two fawns, 
SNG.7.3	twins of a gazelle. 
SNG.7.4	Your neck is like a tower of ivory; 
SNG.7.4	your eyes are pools in Heshbon at the gate of Beth Rabbim. 
SNG.7.4	Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon 
SNG.7.4	looking out over Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Your head crowns you like Carmel;
SNG.7.5	the flowing locks of your head are like purple tapestry;
SNG.7.5	a king is held captive in the tresses! 
SNG.7.6	How beautiful you are and how pleasant, 
SNG.7.6	O loved one in the delights! 
SNG.7.7	Your stature
SNG.7.7	and your breasts are like clusters. 
SNG.7.8	I say, “I will climb up the palm tree; 
SNG.7.8	I will lay hold of its fruit clusters.” 
SNG.7.8	Let your breasts be pleasing like clusters of the vine 
SNG.7.8	and the scent of your breath like the apples. 
SNG.7.9	Your palate is like the best wine that goes down for my beloved, 
SNG.7.9	smoothly gliding over my lips and teeth.
SNG.7.10	I belong to my beloved,
SNG.7.10	and he desires me!
SNG.7.11	Come, my beloved, let us go out to the countryside;
SNG.7.11	let us spend the night
SNG.7.12	Let us rise early to go
SNG.7.12	let us see whether the vine has budded,
SNG.7.12	whether the grape blossom has opened, 
SNG.7.12	and whether the pomegranates are in bloom;
SNG.7.12	there I will give my love to you. 
SNG.7.13	The mandrakes give off their fragrance, 
SNG.7.13	and over our doorway is every kind of delicious fruit;
SNG.7.13	both fresh and dried fruit I have stored up
SNG.8.1	How I wish that you were my little brother,
SNG.8.1	who nursed upon my mother’s breasts!
SNG.8.1	If I met you outside,
SNG.8.1	and no one would despise me!
SNG.8.2	I would surely bring you
SNG.8.2	who would surely teach me;
SNG.8.2	I would give you spiced wine to drink,
SNG.8.2	the sweet wine
SNG.8.3	His left hand is under my head, 
SNG.8.3	and his right hand embraces
SNG.8.4	I adjure you, O maidens of Jerusalem,
SNG.8.4	do not
SNG.8.5	Who is this coming up from the wilderness, 
SNG.8.5	leaning upon her beloved? 
SNG.8.5	Under the apple tree I awakened you; 
SNG.8.5	there your mother conceived you;
SNG.8.5	there she who was in labor gave birth to you. 
SNG.8.6	Set me as a seal upon your heart, 
SNG.8.6	as a seal upon your arm; 
SNG.8.6	for love is strong as death; 
SNG.8.6	passion is fierce as Sheol; 
SNG.8.6	its flashes are flashes of fire; 
SNG.8.6	it is a blazing flame. 
SNG.8.7	Many waters cannot quench love; 
SNG.8.7	rivers cannot sweep it away.
SNG.8.7	If a man were to give all the wealth of his house for love,
SNG.8.7	he would be utterly scorned.
SNG.8.8	We have a little sister,
SNG.8.8	and she does not yet have any breasts.
SNG.8.8	What should we do for our sister 
SNG.8.8	on the day when she is betrothed?
SNG.8.9	If she is a wall, 
SNG.8.9	we will adorn her with a turret of silver;
SNG.8.9	but if she is a door, 
SNG.8.9	we will barricade her with boards of cedar.
SNG.8.10	I was a wall, and my breasts were like the towers, 
SNG.8.10	so my betrothed viewed me with great delight.
SNG.8.11	Solomon had a vineyard
SNG.8.11	he entrusted his vineyard to the keepers;
SNG.8.11	people paid a thousand silver pieces for its fruit.
SNG.8.12	My own “vineyard” belongs to me;
SNG.8.12	the “thousand” are for you, O Solomon, 
SNG.8.12	and “two hundred” for those who tend its fruit.
SNG.8.13	O you who dwell in the garden, 
SNG.8.13	my companions are listening to your voice. 
SNG.8.13	Let me hear it! 
SNG.8.14	Flee, my beloved! 
SNG.8.14	Be like a gazelle
SNG.8.14	upon the perfumed mountains!
ISA.1.1	The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. 
ISA.1.2	Hear, heavens, 
ISA.1.2	and listen, earth, 
ISA.1.2	for Yahweh has spoken: 
ISA.1.2	“I reared children 
ISA.1.2	and I brought them up, 
ISA.1.2	but they rebelled against me. 
ISA.1.3	An ox knows its owner 
ISA.1.3	and a donkey the manger of its master. 
ISA.1.3	Israel does not know; 
ISA.1.3	my people do not understand. 
ISA.1.4	Ah, sinful nation, 
ISA.1.4	a people heavy with iniquity, 
ISA.1.4	offspring of evildoers, 
ISA.1.4	children who deal corruptly. 
ISA.1.4	They have forsaken Yahweh; 
ISA.1.4	they have despised the holy one of Israel. 
ISA.1.4	They are estranged and gone backward. 
ISA.1.5	Why do you want to be beaten again? 
ISA.1.5	You continue in rebellion. 
ISA.1.5	The whole of the head is sick, 
ISA.1.5	and the whole of the heart is faint. 
ISA.1.6	From the sole of the foot and up to the head 
ISA.1.6	there is no health in it; 
ISA.1.6	bruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed, 
ISA.1.6	and they have not been bound up 
ISA.1.6	and not softened with the oil. 
ISA.1.7	Your country is desolate, 
ISA.1.7	your cities are burned with fire; 
ISA.1.7	As for your land, aliens are devouring it in your presence, 
ISA.1.7	and it is desolate, like devastation by foreigners. 
ISA.1.8	And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, 
ISA.1.8	like a shelter in a cucumber field, 
ISA.1.8	like a city that is besieged.
ISA.1.9	If Yahweh of hosts had not left us survivors,
ISA.1.9	we would have been as few as Sodom, 
ISA.1.9	we would have become like Gomorrah. 
ISA.1.10	Hear the word of Yahweh, rulers of Sodom! 
ISA.1.10	Listen to the teaching of our God, people of Gomorrah! 
ISA.1.11	What is the abundance of your sacrifices to me? says Yahweh. 
ISA.1.11	I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams 
ISA.1.11	and the fat of fattened animals 
ISA.1.11	and I do not delight in the blood of bulls 
ISA.1.11	and ram-lambs and goats. 
ISA.1.12	When you come to appear before me, 
ISA.1.12	who asked for this from your hand: 
ISA.1.12	you trampling my courts? 
ISA.1.13	You must not continue
ISA.1.13	incense—it is an abomination to me; 
ISA.1.13	new moon and Sabbath, the calling of a convocation— 
ISA.1.13	I cannot endure iniquity with solemn assembly. 
ISA.1.14	Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates; 
ISA.1.14	they have become to me like a burden, 
ISA.1.14	I am not able to bear them. 
ISA.1.15	And when you stretch out your hands, 
ISA.1.15	I will hide my eyes from you; 
ISA.1.15	even though you make many prayers,
ISA.1.15	I will not be listening. 
ISA.1.15	Your hands are full of blood. 
ISA.1.16	Wash! Make yourselves clean! 
ISA.1.16	Remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes! 
ISA.1.16	Cease to do evil! 
ISA.1.17	Learn to do good! 
ISA.1.17	Seek justice! Rescue the oppressed! 
ISA.1.17	Defend the orphan! Plead for the widow! 
ISA.1.18	“Come now, and let us argue,” says Yahweh. 
ISA.1.18	“Even though your sins are like scarlet, they will be white like snow; 
ISA.1.18	even though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool. 
ISA.1.19	If you are willing and you are obedient, 
ISA.1.19	you shall eat the good of the land. 
ISA.1.20	But if you refuse and you rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword. 
ISA.1.20	For the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.” 
ISA.1.21	How has a faithful city become like a whore? 
ISA.1.21	Full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers. 
ISA.1.22	Your silver has become as dross; 
ISA.1.22	Your wine is diluted with waters. 
ISA.1.23	Your princes are rebels 
ISA.1.23	and companions of thieves. 
ISA.1.23	Every one loves a bribe 
ISA.1.23	and runs after gifts. 
ISA.1.23	They do not defend the orphan 
ISA.1.23	and the legal dispute of the widow does not come before them. 
ISA.1.24	Therefore, the declaration of the Lord Yahweh of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: 
ISA.1.24	“Ah, I will be relieved of my enemies, 
ISA.1.24	and I will avenge myself on my foes. 
ISA.1.25	And I will turn my hand against you; 
ISA.1.25	I will purify your dross like lye, 
ISA.1.25	and I will remove all of your tin. 
ISA.1.26	And I will restore your judges, as at the first, 
ISA.1.26	and your counselors, as at the beginning. 
ISA.1.26	After this you will be called
ISA.1.26	faithful city. 
ISA.1.27	Zion will be redeemed by justice, 
ISA.1.27	and those of her who repent, by righteousness. 
ISA.1.28	But the destruction of rebels and sinners shall be together, 
ISA.1.28	and those who forsake Yahweh will perish. 
ISA.1.29	For you
ISA.1.29	and you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. 
ISA.1.30	For you shall be like an oak withering its leaves, 
ISA.1.30	and like a garden where there is no water for her. 
ISA.1.31	And the strong man shall become like tinder, 
ISA.1.31	and his work like a spark. 
ISA.1.31	And both of them shall burn together, 
ISA.1.31	and there is not one to quench them.” 
ISA.2.1	The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem: 
ISA.2.2	And it shall happen in the future of the days 
ISA.2.2	the mountain of the house
ISA.2.2	it will be among the highest
ISA.2.2	and it shall be raised from the hills. 
ISA.2.2	All of the nations shall travel to him; 
ISA.2.3	many peoples shall come. 
ISA.2.3	And they shall say, 
ISA.2.3	“Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, 
ISA.2.3	to the house
ISA.2.3	and may he teach us part of his ways, 
ISA.2.3	and let us walk in his paths.” 
ISA.2.3	For instruction shall go out from Zion, 
ISA.2.3	and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem. 
ISA.2.4	He shall judge between the nations 
ISA.2.4	and he shall arbitrate for many peoples. 
ISA.2.4	They shall beat their swords into ploughshares 
ISA.2.4	and their spears into pruning hooks. 
ISA.2.4	A nation shall not lift up a sword against a nation, 
ISA.2.4	and they shall not learn war again. 
ISA.2.5	House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Yahweh. 
ISA.2.6	For you have forsaken your people, house of Jacob, 
ISA.2.6	because they are full
ISA.2.6	and of soothsayers like the Philistines, 
ISA.2.6	and they make alliances
ISA.2.7	And its land is filled with silver and gold, 
ISA.2.7	and there is no end to its treasures; 
ISA.2.7	and its land is filled with horses, 
ISA.2.7	and there is no end to its chariots. 
ISA.2.8	Its land is filled with idols; 
ISA.2.8	they bow down to the work of their
ISA.2.8	to what they made with their
ISA.2.9	So humanity is humbled; 
ISA.2.9	everyone is humbled, 
ISA.2.9	and you must not forgive them. 
ISA.2.10	Enter into the rock 
ISA.2.10	and hide yourself in the dust 
ISA.2.10	from the presence of the terror of Yahweh 
ISA.2.10	and from the glory of his majesty. 
ISA.2.11	The haughty eyes
ISA.2.11	and the pride of everyone will be humbled, 
ISA.2.11	and Yahweh alone will be exalted on that day. 
ISA.2.12	For there is a day for Yahweh of hosts 
ISA.2.12	against all of the proud and the lofty 
ISA.2.12	and against all that is lifted up and humble,
ISA.2.13	and against all the lofty and lifted up cedars of Lebanon, 
ISA.2.13	and against all the large trees of Bashan, 
ISA.2.14	and against all the high mountains, 
ISA.2.14	and against all the lofty hills, 
ISA.2.15	and against every kind of high tower, 
ISA.2.15	and against every kind of fortified wall, 
ISA.2.16	and against all the ships of Tarshish, 
ISA.2.16	and against all the ships of desire. 
ISA.2.17	And the haughtiness of the people shall be humbled, 
ISA.2.17	and the pride of everyone shall be brought low, 
ISA.2.17	and Yahweh alone will be exalted on that day. 
ISA.2.18	And the idols shall pass away entirely, 
ISA.2.19	and they will enter into the caves of the rocks 
ISA.2.19	and into the holes of the ground 
ISA.2.19	from the presence of the terror of Yahweh 
ISA.2.19	and from the glory of his majesty 
ISA.2.19	when he rises
ISA.2.20	On that day humanity will throw away its idols of silver 
ISA.2.20	and its idols of gold, 
ISA.2.20	which they made for it to worship, 
ISA.2.20	to the rodents
ISA.2.21	to enter into the crevices of the rocks 
ISA.2.21	and into the clefts of the crags 
ISA.2.21	from the presence of the terror of Yahweh 
ISA.2.21	and from the glory of his majesty, 
ISA.2.21	when he rises
ISA.2.22	Turn away from humanity, 
ISA.2.22	who has breath in its nostrils,
ISA.2.22	for by
ISA.3.1	For look, the Lord Yahweh of hosts is removing every source of support
ISA.3.1	from Jerusalem and from Judah: 
ISA.3.1	all of the supplies of bread 
ISA.3.1	and all of the supplies of water, 
ISA.3.2	mighty warrior and man of war, 
ISA.3.2	judge and prophet, 
ISA.3.2	and diviner and elder, 
ISA.3.3	captain of fifty and the honorable men of rank, 
ISA.3.3	and counselor and skillful magicians and skillful enchanter. 
ISA.3.4	And I will make boys their princes, 
ISA.3.4	and children shall rule over them. 
ISA.3.5	And the people will be oppressed by each other
ISA.3.5	and a man by his neighbor. 
ISA.3.5	The boy will act arrogantly toward the elder, 
ISA.3.5	and the dishonorable toward the honorable. 
ISA.3.6	Indeed, a man will seize his brother 
ISA.3.6	in the house of his father: 
ISA.3.6	“You have a cloak;
ISA.3.6	you shall be a leader for us, 
ISA.3.6	and this heap of ruins shall be under your hand!” 
ISA.3.7	He will lift up his voice on that day, saying, 
ISA.3.7	“I will not be a healer; 
ISA.3.7	in my house there is no bread 
ISA.3.7	and there is no cloak. 
ISA.3.7	You shall not make me the leader of the people!” 
ISA.3.8	For Jerusalem has stumbled, 
ISA.3.8	and Judah has fallen 
ISA.3.8	because their speech and their deeds are against Yahweh, 
ISA.3.8	defying the eyes of his glory. 
ISA.3.9	The look on their faces testifies against them 
ISA.3.9	and they declare their sin like Sodom; 
ISA.3.9	they do not hide it. 
ISA.3.9	Woe to their soul! 
ISA.3.9	For they have dealt out evil to themselves. 
ISA.3.10	Tell the innocent
ISA.3.10	for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds. 
ISA.3.11	Woe to the wicked!
ISA.3.11	For what is done by his hands will be done to him. 
ISA.3.12	My people—children are their oppressors, 
ISA.3.12	and women rule over them. 
ISA.3.12	My people, your leaders are misleading you, 
ISA.3.12	and they confuse the course of your paths. 
ISA.3.13	Yahweh takes his stand to conduct a legal case 
ISA.3.13	and takes his stand to judge the peoples. 
ISA.3.14	Yahweh enters into judgment with the elders of his people and its princes. 
ISA.3.14	“And you! You have devoured the vineyard; 
ISA.3.14	the spoil of the poor is in your houses! 
ISA.3.15	Why
ISA.3.15	and grind the face of the poor?” 
ISA.3.15	declares
ISA.3.16	And Yahweh said: “Because
ISA.3.16	and they walk with outstretched neck, 
ISA.3.16	and they give flirting glances with their eyes, 
ISA.3.16	mincing along as they go,
ISA.3.16	and with their feet they rattle their bangles,
ISA.3.17	the Lord will make the heads
ISA.3.17	and Yahweh will lay their foreheads bare.” 
ISA.3.18	In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets 
ISA.3.18	and the headbands and the crescent necklaces, 
ISA.3.19	the pendants and the bracelets and the veils, 
ISA.3.20	the headdresses and the armlets and the sashes, 
ISA.3.20	and the perfume boxes
ISA.3.21	the signet rings and the nose rings, 
ISA.3.22	the festal robes and the mantles, 
ISA.3.22	and the cloaks and the handbags, 
ISA.3.23	and the mirrors and the linen garments, 
ISA.3.23	and the turbans and the wraps. 
ISA.3.24	And this shall happen: There will be 
ISA.3.24	a stench instead of perfume, 
ISA.3.24	and a rope instead of a sash, 
ISA.3.24	and baldness instead of a well-set hairdo, 
ISA.3.24	and a clothing wrap of sackcloth instead of a rich robe, 
ISA.3.24	branding instead of beauty. 
ISA.3.25	Your men shall fall by the sword, 
ISA.3.25	and your warriors in battle. 
ISA.3.26	And her
ISA.3.26	and she shall be banished; 
ISA.3.26	she shall sit upon the ground. 
ISA.4.1	 And seven women shall grasp at one man on that day, saying, 
ISA.4.1	“We will eat our own bread, 
ISA.4.1	and we will wear our own clothing; 
ISA.4.1	only let us be called by your name!
ISA.4.1	Take away our disgrace!” 
ISA.4.2	On that day the branch of Yahweh shall become beautiful and glorious, 
ISA.4.2	and the fruit of the land shall become the pride and glory of the survivors
ISA.4.3	And this shall happen: He who is left in Zion 
ISA.4.3	and he who remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, 
ISA.4.3	everyone written for life in Jerusalem, 
ISA.4.4	when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion 
ISA.4.4	and cleansed the blood of Jerusalem from her midst 
ISA.4.4	by a spirit of judgment 
ISA.4.4	and by a spirit of burning. 
ISA.4.5	Then Yahweh will create over all of the site
ISA.4.5	and over her assembly a cloud by day 
ISA.4.5	and smoke and the brightness of flaming fire by night. 
ISA.4.5	Indeed, over all the glory there will be a canopy, 
ISA.4.6	and it will be a shelter for shade from the heat by day, 
ISA.4.6	and a refuge and a hiding place from rainstorm and from rain. 
ISA.5.1	Let me sing for my beloved 
ISA.5.1	a song of my love concerning his vineyard: 
ISA.5.1	My beloved had a vineyard
ISA.5.2	And he dug it and cleared it of stones, 
ISA.5.2	and he planted it with choice vines,
ISA.5.2	and he built a watchtower in the middle of it, 
ISA.5.2	and he even hewed out a wine vat in it, 
ISA.5.2	and he waited for it to yield grapes— 
ISA.5.2	but it yielded wild grapes. 
ISA.5.3	And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem 
ISA.5.3	and men
ISA.5.4	What more was there to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it? 
ISA.5.4	Why did I hope for it to yield grapes, and it yielded wild grapes? 
ISA.5.5	And now let me tell you what I myself am about to do to my vineyard. 
ISA.5.5	I will remove its hedge, and it shall become a devastation. 
ISA.5.5	I will break down its wall, and it shall become a trampling. 
ISA.5.6	And I will make it a wasteland; 
ISA.5.6	it shall not be pruned and hoed, 
ISA.5.6	and it shall be overgrown with briers
ISA.5.6	And concerning the clouds, I will command them not to send
ISA.5.7	For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel, 
ISA.5.7	and the man
ISA.5.7	And he waited for justice,
ISA.5.7	but look! Bloodshed!
ISA.5.7	For righteousness,
ISA.5.7	but look! A cry of distress!
ISA.5.8	Ah! Those who join
ISA.5.8	they join field together with field 
ISA.5.8	until there is no place
ISA.5.8	and you are caused to dwell alone in the midst of the land. 
ISA.5.9	Yahweh of hosts said in my ears: 
ISA.5.9	Surely
ISA.5.9	large and beautiful ones without inhabitant. 
ISA.5.10	For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath,
ISA.5.10	and the seed of a homer will yield an ephah.
ISA.5.11	Ah! Those who rise early in the morning, 
ISA.5.11	they pursue strong drink. 
ISA.5.11	Those who linger in the evening, 
ISA.5.11	wine inflames them. 
ISA.5.12	And there will be lyre and harp, 
ISA.5.12	tambourine and flute, 
ISA.5.12	and wine at their feasts, 
ISA.5.12	but they do not look at the deeds
ISA.5.12	and they do not see the work of his hands. 
ISA.5.13	Therefore my people will go into exile without knowledge, 
ISA.5.13	and their
ISA.5.13	and their
ISA.5.14	Therefore Sheol has enlarged its throat, 
ISA.5.14	and it has opened wide its mouth without limit, 
ISA.5.14	and her
ISA.5.14	her tumult and those who revel in her. 
ISA.5.15	And humankind is bowed down, 
ISA.5.15	and man is brought low, 
ISA.5.15	and the eyes of the haughty are humiliated. 
ISA.5.16	But Yahweh of hosts is exalted by justice, 
ISA.5.16	and the holy God shows himself holy by righteousness. 
ISA.5.17	And then the lambs will graze as in their pasture, 
ISA.5.17	and fatlings, kids
ISA.5.18	Ah! Those who drag iniquity along with the cords of falsehood 
ISA.5.18	and sin as with rope of the cart, 
ISA.5.19	those who say, 
ISA.5.19	“Let him make haste; 
ISA.5.19	let him hurry his work 
ISA.5.19	so that we may see it 
ISA.5.19	and let it draw near 
ISA.5.19	and let the plan of the holy one of Israel come 
ISA.5.19	so that we may know it!” 
ISA.5.20	Ah! Those who call evil good and good evil, 
ISA.5.20	those who put darkness for light and light for darkness, 
ISA.5.20	those who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter! 
ISA.5.21	Ah! Those who are wise in their own eyes 
ISA.5.21	and have understanding in their view!
ISA.5.22	Ah! Heroes at drinking wine, 
ISA.5.22	and men of capability at mixing strong drink! 
ISA.5.23	Those who acquit the guilty because of a bribe 
ISA.5.23	and remove the justice of the innocent from him. 
ISA.5.24	Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, 
ISA.5.24	and dry grass sinks down in the flame, 
ISA.5.24	so their root will become like the stench, 
ISA.5.24	and their blossom will go up like the dust. 
ISA.5.24	For they have rejected the instruction of Yahweh of hosts, 
ISA.5.24	and they have treated the word of the holy one of Israel with contempt. 
ISA.5.25	Therefore Yahweh’s wrath was kindled
ISA.5.25	and he stretched out his hand against them
ISA.5.25	and the mountains quaked, 
ISA.5.25	and their corpses
ISA.5.25	In all of this his anger has not turned back, 
ISA.5.25	and still his hand is stretched out. 
ISA.5.26	And he will raise a signal for a nation
ISA.5.26	and he will whistle for it from the end of the earth. 
ISA.5.26	And look! It comes quickly, swiftly! 
ISA.5.27	None is weary, 
ISA.5.27	and none among him stumbles; 
ISA.5.27	none slumbers and none sleeps. 
ISA.5.27	And no loincloth on his waist is opened, 
ISA.5.27	and no thong of his sandals is drawn away. 
ISA.5.28	Whose arrows are sharp, 
ISA.5.28	and all of his bows are bent. 
ISA.5.28	The hoofs of his horses are reckoned like flint, 
ISA.5.28	and his wheels like the storm wind. 
ISA.5.29	His roaring is like the lion, 
ISA.5.29	and he roars like young lions. 
ISA.5.29	And he growls and seizes his prey, 
ISA.5.29	and he carries it off, 
ISA.5.29	and not one can rescue it. 
ISA.5.30	And he will roar over him on that day 
ISA.5.30	like the roaring of the sea, 
ISA.5.30	and if one looks to the land, look! Darkness! Distress! 
ISA.5.30	And the light grows dark with its
ISA.6.1	In the year of the death of Uzziah the king, I saw the Lord sitting on a high and raised throne, and the hem of his robe was filling the temple. 
ISA.6.2	Seraphs were standing above him. Each had six wings:
ISA.6.3	And the one called to the other and said, 
ISA.6.3	“Holy, holy, holy is Yahweh of hosts! 
ISA.6.3	The whole earth is full of his glory.”
ISA.6.4	And the pivots of the thresholds shook from the sound of those who called, and the house
ISA.6.5	And I said, “Woe to me! For I am destroyed!
ISA.6.6	Then one of the seraphs flew to me, and in his hand was a hot coal he had taken from the altar with tongs. 
ISA.6.7	And he touched my mouth, and he said, 
ISA.6.7	“Look! This has touched your lips 
ISA.6.7	and has removed your guilt, 
ISA.6.7	and your sin is annulled.” 
ISA.6.8	Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, 
ISA.6.8	“Whom shall I send? 
ISA.6.8	And who will go for us?” 
ISA.6.8	And I said, 
ISA.6.8	“I am here! 
ISA.6.8	Send me!” 
ISA.6.9	And he said, “Go and say to this people, 
ISA.6.9	‘Keep on listening and do not comprehend! 
ISA.6.9	And keep on looking and do not understand!’ 
ISA.6.10	Make the heart of this people insensitive, 
ISA.6.10	and make its ears unresponsive, 
ISA.6.10	and shut its eyes 
ISA.6.10	so that it may not look with its eyes 
ISA.6.10	and listen with its ears 
ISA.6.10	and comprehend with its mind 
ISA.6.10	and turn back, and it may be healed for him.” 
ISA.6.11	Then I said, “Until when, Lord?” 
ISA.6.11	And he said, 
ISA.6.11	“Until the cities lie wasted without inhabitant, 
ISA.6.11	and houses without people, 
ISA.6.11	and the land is ruined and a waste, 
ISA.6.12	and Yahweh sends the people far away, 
ISA.6.12	and the abandonment is great in the midst of the land. 
ISA.6.13	And even if only a tenth part remain,
ISA.6.13	like a terebinth or like an oak, 
ISA.6.13	which although felled, a tree stump remains in them. 
ISA.6.13	The seed of holiness will be her tree stump.” 
ISA.7.1	This happened in the days of Ahaz, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah. Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went
ISA.7.2	When it was reported to the house of David, saying “Aram stands by Ephraim,” his heart and the heart of his people shook like the shaking of the trees of the forest because of the wind. 
ISA.7.3	Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, “Go out to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-Jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway of the washer’s field. 
ISA.7.4	And you must say to him, ‘Take heed and be quiet! You must not fear, and your heart must not be faint because of these two stumps of smoldering firebrands, because of the fierce anger of
ISA.7.5	Because Aram has plotted evil against you with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, saying, 
ISA.7.6	“Let us go up against Judah and let us tear her apart, and let us lay it open and so bring it unto ourselves,
ISA.7.7	Thus says the Lord Yahweh, “It shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass. 
ISA.7.8	For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin, and in sixty-five years from now Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people. 
ISA.7.9	And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not believe then you will not endure.” ’ ” 
ISA.7.10	And Yahweh continued to speak to Ahaz, saying, 
ISA.7.11	“Ask for a sign for yourself from Yahweh God; make it deep as Sheol or make it high as above.” 
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put Yahweh to the test.” 
ISA.7.13	Then he said, “Hear, house of David! Is it too little for you to make men weary, that you should also make my God weary? 
ISA.7.14	Therefore the Lord himself will give you
ISA.7.15	He shall eat curds and honey until he knows to reject the evil and to choose the good. 
ISA.7.16	For before the boy knows to reject the evil and to choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be abandoned.
ISA.7.17	“Yahweh will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your ancestor
ISA.7.18	And this shall happen: On that day, Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is at the end of the stream of Egypt and the bee that is in the land of Assyria. 
ISA.7.19	And all of them will come and settle in the rivers of the cliffs and in the clefts of the rocks and on all of the thornbushes and watering places. 
ISA.7.20	On that day, the Lord will shave the head and the hair of the feet with a razor of the one hired from beyond the river—with the king of Assyria—and it will even take off the beard. 
ISA.7.21	And this shall happen: on that day, a young man will keep a young cow of the herd and two sheep alive. 
ISA.7.22	And this shall happen: because of the abundance of milk production, he will eat curds, for every one that is left in the midst of the land will eat curds and honey. 
ISA.7.23	And this shall happen on that day: Every place where there are a thousand vines
ISA.7.24	One will go there with arrows and bow, for all of the land will be briers
ISA.7.25	And as for all of the hills that they hoed with the hoe, you will not go there, for fear of briers
ISA.8.1	Then Yahweh said to me, “Take yourself a large tablet and write on it with a common stylus pen: Maher-Halal-Hash-Baz. 
ISA.8.2	And I will require reliable witnesses as a witness for me: Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.” 
ISA.8.3	And I approached the prophetess, and she conceived, and she gave birth to a son. And Yahweh said to me, “Call his name Maher-Halal-Hash-Baz. 
ISA.8.4	For before the boy knows to call ‘my father’ and ‘my mother,’ one will carry away the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria in the presence of the king of Assyria.” 
ISA.8.5	And Yahweh continued to speak to me again, saying, 
ISA.8.6	“Because this people has refused the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices over Rezin and the son of Remaliah, 
ISA.8.7	therefore look! The Lord is bringing up the waters of the great and mighty river against them, the king of Assyria and all his glory. 
ISA.8.7	And he will rise above all his channels, 
ISA.8.7	and he will flow over all his banks. 
ISA.8.8	And he will sweep into Judah; 
ISA.8.8	he will overflow and he will flood up to the neck. 
ISA.8.8	He will reach, and he will spread his wings out over your entire land,
ISA.8.9	Be broken, you peoples, and be dismayed. 
ISA.8.9	And listen, all distant parts of the earth; 
ISA.8.9	gird yourselves and be dismayed; 
ISA.8.9	gird yourselves and be dismayed! 
ISA.8.10	Make a plan,
ISA.8.10	Speak a word, but it will not stand, 
ISA.8.10	for God is with us! 
ISA.8.11	For Yahweh said this to me while his hand weighed heavily on me,
ISA.8.11	and he warned me not to walk
ISA.8.12	“You must not call conspiracy everything that this people calls conspiracy, 
ISA.8.12	and you must not share its fear,
ISA.8.13	You shall regard Yahweh of hosts as holy, 
ISA.8.13	and he is your
ISA.8.14	And he will become like a sanctuary and a stumbling-stone, 
ISA.8.14	and like a stumbling-rock for the two houses of Israel, 
ISA.8.14	like a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
ISA.8.15	And many shall stumble among them, 
ISA.8.15	and they shall fall and they shall be broken, 
ISA.8.15	and they shall be ensnared and they shall be caught.” 
ISA.8.16	Bind up the testimony; 
ISA.8.16	seal the teaching among my disciples. 
ISA.8.17	And I will wait for Yahweh, 
ISA.8.17	who hides his face from the house of Jacob, 
ISA.8.17	and I will await him. 
ISA.8.18	Look! I and the children whom Yahweh has given to me are like signs and portents in Israel from Yahweh of hosts, the one who dwells on the mountain of Zion. 
ISA.8.19	Now if they tell you, “Consult the ghosts and the spirits, those who chirp and those who mutter. Should not a people consult its gods, the dead on behalf of the living, 
ISA.8.20	for teaching and for testimony?” surely they who speak like this have no dawn.
ISA.8.21	And it
ISA.8.22	or look to the earth. But look! Distress and darkness, the gloom of affliction! And it will be thrust into darkness! 
ISA.9.1	 But there will be no gloom for those who were in distress.
ISA.9.1	In former times he
ISA.9.2	The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; 
ISA.9.2	light has shined on those who lived in a land of darkness. 
ISA.9.3	You have made the nation numerous; 
ISA.9.3	you have not
ISA.9.3	They rejoice in your presence as with joy at the harvest, 
ISA.9.3	as they rejoice when they divide plunder. 
ISA.9.4	For you have shattered the yoke of its burden 
ISA.9.4	and the stick of its shoulder, 
ISA.9.4	the rod of its oppressor, on
ISA.9.5	For every boot that marches and shakes the earth
ISA.9.5	and garment rolled in blood 
ISA.9.5	will
ISA.9.6	For a child has been born for us; 
ISA.9.6	a son has been given to us. 
ISA.9.6	And the dominion will be on his shoulder, 
ISA.9.6	and his name is called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, 
ISA.9.6	Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 
ISA.9.7	His dominion will grow continually, 
ISA.9.7	and to peace there will be no end
ISA.9.7	on
ISA.9.7	to establish it
ISA.9.7	with justice and righteousness 
ISA.9.7	now and forever. 
ISA.9.7	The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will do this. 
ISA.9.8	The Lord has sent out a word against Jacob, 
ISA.9.8	and it fell on Israel. 
ISA.9.9	And all of the people knew it, 
ISA.9.9	Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria 
ISA.9.9	in pride and arrogance of heart, saying, 
ISA.9.10	“The bricks have fallen, but we will build with dressed stone. 
ISA.9.10	The sycamore-fig trees were felled, but we will replace them with cedars.” 
ISA.9.11	So Yahweh strengthened the adversaries of Rezin
ISA.9.11	and he provoked his enemies— 
ISA.9.12	Aram from the east 
ISA.9.12	and Philistines
ISA.9.12	and they devoured Israel with the whole mouth. 
ISA.9.12	He has not turned away his anger in all of this, 
ISA.9.12	and his hand is still stretched out. 
ISA.9.13	And the people did not turn to the one who struck it,
ISA.9.13	and they did not seek Yahweh of hosts. 
ISA.9.14	So Yahweh cut off head and tail from Israel, 
ISA.9.14	palm branch and reed in one day. 
ISA.9.15	Elders
ISA.9.15	and prophets
ISA.9.16	And the leaders of this people were misleading them, 
ISA.9.16	and those who were led were confused. 
ISA.9.17	Therefore the Lord did not rejoice over its young men, 
ISA.9.17	and he did not have compassion on its orphans and widows, 
ISA.9.17	for everyone was godless and an evildoer, 
ISA.9.17	and every mouth was speaking folly. 
ISA.9.17	In all of this his anger did not turn away, 
ISA.9.17	and still his hand is stretched out. 
ISA.9.18	For wickedness burned like fire; 
ISA.9.18	it consumed brier and thorn. 
ISA.9.18	And it kindled the thickets of the forest, 
ISA.9.18	and they swirled upward in a column of smoke. 
ISA.9.19	The land was burned through the wrath of Yahweh of hosts, 
ISA.9.19	and the people became like fire fuel. 
ISA.9.19	People had no compassion toward each other.
ISA.9.20	They devoured on the right but still were hungry 
ISA.9.20	and devoured on the left but they were not satisfied. 
ISA.9.20	Each one devoured the flesh of his arm, 
ISA.9.21	Manasseh devoured Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh; 
ISA.9.21	together they were against Judah. 
ISA.9.21	In all of this his anger has not turned away, 
ISA.9.21	and still his hand is stretched out. 
ISA.10.1	Ah! Those who decree decrees of evil, 
ISA.10.1	and writers who have written harm, 
ISA.10.2	to guide the needy away from legal claims,
ISA.10.2	and to rob the justice from the poor of my people, 
ISA.10.2	to make widows their spoil; 
ISA.10.2	and they plunder orphans. 
ISA.10.3	And what will you do at the day of punishment, 
ISA.10.3	and at calamity? It comes from afar! 
ISA.10.3	To whom will you flee for help, 
ISA.10.3	and where will you leave your wealth, 
ISA.10.4	save that they bow down under the prisoners 
ISA.10.4	and fall under the slain?
ISA.10.4	In all of this his anger has not turned away, 
ISA.10.4	and still his hand is stretched out. 
ISA.10.5	Ah! Assyria, the rod of my anger, 
ISA.10.5	and a staff is in their hand: my wrath! 
ISA.10.6	I send him against a godless nation, 
ISA.10.6	and I command him against the people of my wrath, 
ISA.10.6	to capture spoil 
ISA.10.6	and to carry off plunder, 
ISA.10.6	and to make them
ISA.10.6	like the clay of the streets. 
ISA.10.7	But he does not think this,
ISA.10.7	and his heart does not plan this. 
ISA.10.7	For it is in his heart to destroy 
ISA.10.7	and to cut off not a few nations. 
ISA.10.8	For he says, “Are not my commanders altogether kings? 
ISA.10.9	Is not Calno like Carchemish? 
ISA.10.9	Is not Hamath like Arpad? 
ISA.10.9	Is not Samaria like Damascus? 
ISA.10.10	As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols
ISA.10.10	—and their images were greater than those of
ISA.10.11	shall I not do to Jerusalem and its idols 
ISA.10.11	what I have done to Samaria and her idols?” 
ISA.10.12	And this shall happen: when the Lord has finished all his work against Mount Zion
ISA.10.13	For he says, 
ISA.10.13	“I have done it by the strength of my hand 
ISA.10.13	and by my wisdom, for I have understanding, 
ISA.10.13	and I have removed the boundaries of peoples, 
ISA.10.13	and I have plundered their stores, 
ISA.10.13	and like a bull I have brought down the inhabitants.
ISA.10.14	And my hand has found, like a nest, the wealth of the peoples, 
ISA.10.14	and like the gathering of forsaken eggs, I myself have gathered all the earth. 
ISA.10.14	And there was no fluttering wing or open mouth or chirp.” 
ISA.10.15	Does the ax boast against the one who cuts with it, 
ISA.10.15	or the saw magnify itself against the one who moves it to and fro? 
ISA.10.15	As if a rod should move the one who lifts it!
ISA.10.15	As if a staff should lift up that which is not wood!
ISA.10.16	Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, will send leanness among his sturdy warriors, 
ISA.10.16	and a burning like the burning of fire will burn under his glory. 
ISA.10.17	And the light of Israel will become like a fire, 
ISA.10.17	and his holy one like a flame, 
ISA.10.17	and it will burn and devour his thorns
ISA.10.18	And he will destroy the glory of his forest and orchard completely,
ISA.10.18	and it will be like the wasting away of one who is sick. 
ISA.10.19	And the rest of the trees
ISA.10.19	and a boy can write them down. 
ISA.10.20	And this shall happen: on that day, the remnant of Israel and the survivors
ISA.10.20	but will lean on Yahweh, the holy one of Israel, in truth. 
ISA.10.21	A remnant will return— 
ISA.10.21	the remnant of Jacob—to the mighty God. 
ISA.10.22	For though your people Israel was like the sand of the sea, 
ISA.10.22	only a remnant of it will return. 
ISA.10.22	Annihilation is determined, 
ISA.10.22	overflowing with righteousness. 
ISA.10.23	For the Lord Yahweh of hosts is about to make a complete destruction 
ISA.10.23	and a determined end in the midst of all the earth. 
ISA.10.24	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh of hosts: 
ISA.10.24	“My people who live in Zion, 
ISA.10.24	you must not be afraid of Assyria. 
ISA.10.24	It beats you with the rod, 
ISA.10.24	and it lifts up its staff against you as the Egyptians did.
ISA.10.25	My indignation will come to an end in just a very little while,
ISA.10.25	and my anger will be directed to their destruction.” 
ISA.10.26	And Yahweh of hosts is going to swing a whip against him, 
ISA.10.26	as when Midian was defeated at the rock of Oreb; 
ISA.10.26	and his staff will be over the sea, 
ISA.10.26	and he will lift him up as he did in Egypt.
ISA.10.27	And this shall happen: on that day, 
ISA.10.27	he will remove his burden from your shoulder 
ISA.10.27	and his yoke from your neck, 
ISA.10.27	and a yoke will be destroyed because of fat.
ISA.10.28	He has come to Aiath, 
ISA.10.28	he has passed through Migron; 
ISA.10.28	at Micmash he deposited his baggage. 
ISA.10.29	They crossed over the pass; 
ISA.10.29	Geba is a place of overnight lodging for us. 
ISA.10.29	Ramah trembles; 
ISA.10.29	Gibeah of Saul has fled. 
ISA.10.30	Daughter of Gallim, cry out with your voice; 
ISA.10.30	Laishah, listen! 
ISA.10.30	Anathoth is poor.
ISA.10.31	Madmenah flees! 
ISA.10.31	The inhabitants of Gebim bring themselves into safety! 
ISA.10.32	This day
ISA.10.32	he will shake his fist at the mountain of the daughter
ISA.10.32	at the hill of Jerusalem. 
ISA.10.33	Look! The Lord Yahweh of hosts is about to lop off the branches
ISA.10.33	and the towering trees
ISA.10.33	and the tall trees
ISA.10.34	And he will cut down the thickets of the forest with the axe, 
ISA.10.34	and Lebanon will fall by the mighty one. 
ISA.11.1	And a shoot will come out from the stump of Jesse, 
ISA.11.1	and a branch from its roots will bear fruit. 
ISA.11.2	And the spirit of Yahweh shall rest on him— 
ISA.11.2	a spirit of wisdom and understanding, 
ISA.11.2	a spirit of counsel and might, 
ISA.11.2	a spirit of knowledge and the fear of Yahweh. 
ISA.11.3	And his breath
ISA.11.3	And he shall judge not by his eyesight, 
ISA.11.3	and he shall rebuke not by what he hears with
ISA.11.4	But he shall judge the poor with righteousness, 
ISA.11.4	and he shall decide for the needy of the earth with rectitude. 
ISA.11.4	And he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, 
ISA.11.4	and he shall kill the wicked person with the breath of his lips. 
ISA.11.5	And righteousness shall be the belt around his waist, 
ISA.11.5	and faithfulness the belt around his loins. 
ISA.11.6	And a wolf shall stay
ISA.11.6	and a leopard shall lie down with a kid, 
ISA.11.6	and a calf and a lion and a fatling together 
ISA.11.6	as a small boy leads
ISA.11.7	And a cow and a bear shall graze; 
ISA.11.7	their young shall lie down together. 
ISA.11.7	And a lion shall eat straw like the cattle. 
ISA.11.8	And an infant
ISA.11.8	and a toddler
ISA.11.9	They will not injure and they will not destroy on all of my holy mountain,
ISA.11.9	for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh, 
ISA.11.9	as the waters cover the sea. 
ISA.11.10	And this shall happen on that day: 
ISA.11.10	the nations shall inquire of the root of Jesse, 
ISA.11.10	which shall be standing as a signal to the peoples, 
ISA.11.10	and his resting place shall be glorious. 
ISA.11.11	And this shall happen on that day: 
ISA.11.11	The Lord will again extend his hand a second time 
ISA.11.11	to acquire the remnant of his people that is left, 
ISA.11.11	from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the coastlands of the sea, 
ISA.11.12	and he will raise a signal for the nations. 
ISA.11.12	And he will gather the outcasts of Israel, 
ISA.11.12	and he will gather the scattered ones of Judah together from the four corners
ISA.11.13	And the jealousy of Ephraim shall depart, 
ISA.11.13	and the enemies of Judah shall be cut off. 
ISA.11.13	Ephraim shall not be jealous of Judah, 
ISA.11.13	and Judah shall not be an enemy of Ephraim. 
ISA.11.14	But they shall swoop
ISA.11.14	Together they shall plunder the sons of the east. 
ISA.11.14	Edom and Moab will be under their command,
ISA.11.14	and the sons of Ammon will be their subjugated people. 
ISA.11.15	And Yahweh will divide
ISA.11.15	and he will wave his hand over the river
ISA.11.15	and he will strike it into seven streams, 
ISA.11.15	and he will make it passable by foot.
ISA.11.16	So there shall be a highway from Assyria for the remnant of his people that remains, 
ISA.11.16	as there was for Israel when
ISA.12.1	And you will say on that day, 
ISA.12.1	“I will give you thanks, Yahweh, 
ISA.12.1	for though you were angry with me, 
ISA.12.1	your anger turned away, 
ISA.12.1	and you comforted me. 
ISA.12.2	Look! God is my salvation; 
ISA.12.2	I will trust, and I will not be afraid, 
ISA.12.2	for my strength and might is Yah, Yahweh; 
ISA.12.2	and he has become salvation for me.” 
ISA.12.3	And you will draw water from the wells of salvation in joy. 
ISA.12.4	And you will say on that day, 
ISA.12.4	“Give thanks to Yahweh; 
ISA.12.4	call on his name. 
ISA.12.4	Make his deeds known among the peoples; 
ISA.12.4	bring to remembrance that his name is exalted. 
ISA.12.5	Sing praises to Yahweh, for he has done a glorious thing; 
ISA.12.5	this is known in all the earth. 
ISA.12.6	Inhabitant of Zion, shout out and sing for joy, 
ISA.12.6	for the holy one of Israel is great in your midst.” 
ISA.13.1	The oracle of Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw: 
ISA.13.2	Raise a signal on a bare hill, 
ISA.13.2	lift up your voice to them; 
ISA.13.2	wave the hand and may they enter the gateways of the noblemen. 
ISA.13.3	I myself I have commanded my consecrated ones, 
ISA.13.3	I have also summoned my mighty warriors concerning my anger, 
ISA.13.3	the ones who exalt over
ISA.13.4	A sound, a noise is on the mountains, 
ISA.13.4	the likeness of many people! 
ISA.13.4	A sound of the roar of the kingdoms, 
ISA.13.4	of nations gathering! 
ISA.13.4	Yahweh of hosts is mustering an army for battle. 
ISA.13.5	They are coming from a distant land, 
ISA.13.5	from the end of the heavens, 
ISA.13.5	Yahweh and the weapons of his indignation, 
ISA.13.5	to destroy the whole earth.
ISA.13.6	Wail, for the day of Yahweh is near; 
ISA.13.6	it will come like destruction from Shaddai!
ISA.13.7	Therefore all hands will grow slack, 
ISA.13.7	and every human heart will melt, 
ISA.13.8	and they will be dismayed. 
ISA.13.8	Pangs and labor pains will seize them; 
ISA.13.8	they will tremble like a woman giving birth. 
ISA.13.8	They will stare at one another,
ISA.13.8	their faces flushing.
ISA.13.9	Look! The day of Yahweh is coming, 
ISA.13.9	cruel and wrath and the burning of anger, 
ISA.13.9	to make the earth a desolation, 
ISA.13.9	and he will destroy its sinners from it. 
ISA.13.10	For the stars of the heavens and their constellations will not flash forth their light; 
ISA.13.10	the sun will keep back when it comes out, 
ISA.13.10	and the moon will not cause its light to shine. 
ISA.13.11	And I will punish the world for its evil 
ISA.13.11	and the wicked for their iniquity. 
ISA.13.11	And I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant, 
ISA.13.11	and I will bring the haughtiness of tyrants low. 
ISA.13.12	I will make humanity more rare than gold 
ISA.13.12	and humankind more than the gold of Ophir. 
ISA.13.13	Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, 
ISA.13.13	and the earth will quake from its place 
ISA.13.13	because of the wrath of Yahweh of hosts, 
ISA.13.13	and in the day his anger burns. 
ISA.13.14	And this shall happen: 
ISA.13.14	like a hunted gazelle or sheep with none to gather them,
ISA.13.14	they will each turn to his own people, 
ISA.13.14	and they will each flee to his own land. 
ISA.13.15	Everyone who is found will be pierced through, 
ISA.13.15	and everyone who is carried away will fall by the sword. 
ISA.13.16	And their children will be dashed into pieces before their eyes; 
ISA.13.16	their houses will be plundered, and their wives will be raped.
ISA.13.17	Look! I am stirring the Medes up against them, 
ISA.13.17	who do not value silver 
ISA.13.17	and do not delight in gold. 
ISA.13.18	And their bows will shatter young men. 
ISA.13.18	And they will not show mercy on the fruit of the womb; 
ISA.13.18	their eyes will not look compassionately on children. 
ISA.13.19	And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the splendor of the Chaldeans’ pride, will be like when God overthrew
ISA.13.20	It will not be inhabited forever, 
ISA.13.20	and it will not be dwelled in forever;
ISA.13.20	and no Arab will pitch a tent there, 
ISA.13.20	and shepherds will not allow their flocks to lie down there. 
ISA.13.21	But wild animals will lie down there, 
ISA.13.21	and their houses will be full of howling creatures, 
ISA.13.21	and the daughters of ostriches
ISA.13.21	and goats will dance there. 
ISA.13.22	And hyenas will answer in its palaces, 
ISA.13.22	and jackals in the pleasure palaces; 
ISA.13.22	and its time is coming soon,
ISA.13.22	and its days will not be prolonged. 
ISA.14.1	But Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob, 
ISA.14.1	and he will again choose Israel 
ISA.14.1	and set them on their land, 
ISA.14.1	and the immigrant will join himself to them, 
ISA.14.1	and they will attach themselves to the house of Jacob. 
ISA.14.2	And the nations will take them 
ISA.14.2	and bring them to their place, 
ISA.14.2	and the house of Israel will take possession of them
ISA.14.2	as slaves and female slaves. 
ISA.14.2	And this will happen: 
ISA.14.2	they will take their captors captive 
ISA.14.2	and rule over their oppressors. 
ISA.14.3	And it shall happen on the day Yahweh gives you rest from your pain and turmoil and hard labor which you had to perform,
ISA.14.4	that you will take this taunt against the king of Babylon, 
ISA.14.4	and you will say: 
ISA.14.4	“How the oppressor has ceased! 
ISA.14.4	his insolence
ISA.14.5	Yahweh has broken the staff of the wicked, 
ISA.14.5	the scepter of rulers, 
ISA.14.6	that struck the peoples in wrath, a blow without ceasing, 
ISA.14.6	that ruled the nations in anger 
ISA.14.6	with unrestrained persecution.
ISA.14.7	All of the earth rests and is quiet; 
ISA.14.7	they break forth into singing. 
ISA.14.8	Even the cypresses rejoice over you, 
ISA.14.8	the cedars of Lebanon: 
ISA.14.8	‘Since you were laid down, 
ISA.14.8	no wood cutter comes up against us.’ 
ISA.14.9	Sheol below is getting excited over you, 
ISA.14.9	to meet you when you come;
ISA.14.9	it arouses the dead spirits for you, 
ISA.14.9	all of the leaders of the earth. 
ISA.14.9	It raises all of the kings of the nations from their thrones. 
ISA.14.10	All of them will respond and say to you, 
ISA.14.10	‘You yourself also were made weak like us! 
ISA.14.10	You have become the same as us!’ 
ISA.14.11	Your pride is brought down to Sheol, 
ISA.14.11	and the sound of your harps; 
ISA.14.11	maggots
ISA.14.11	and your covering is worms.
ISA.14.12	How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of dawn! 
ISA.14.12	You are cut down to the ground, conqueror of nations! 
ISA.14.13	And you yourself said in your heart, 
ISA.14.13	‘I will ascend to heaven; 
ISA.14.13	I will raise up my throne above the stars of God; 
ISA.14.13	and I will sit on the mountain of assembly 
ISA.14.13	on the summit of Zaphon;
ISA.14.14	I will ascend to the high places of the clouds,
ISA.14.14	I will make myself like the Most High.’ 
ISA.14.15	But you are brought down to Sheol, 
ISA.14.15	to the depths of the pit. 
ISA.14.16	Those who see you will stare at you, 
ISA.14.16	they will look closely at you: 
ISA.14.16	‘Is this the man who made the earth tremble, 
ISA.14.16	who caused kingdoms to shake, 
ISA.14.17	who made the world like the desert 
ISA.14.17	and destroyed its cities, 
ISA.14.17	who would not let his prisoners go home?’ 
ISA.14.18	All the kings of the nations, all of them, lie in glory, 
ISA.14.18	each one in his house. 
ISA.14.19	But as for you, you are thrown away from your grave, 
ISA.14.19	like an abhorrent shoot, 
ISA.14.19	clothed with the slain, 
ISA.14.19	those pierced by the sword, 
ISA.14.19	those who go down to the stones of the pit, 
ISA.14.19	like a corpse that is trodden down. 
ISA.14.20	You will not be united with them in burial 
ISA.14.20	because you have destroyed your land, 
ISA.14.20	you have killed your people. 
ISA.14.20	The descendants
ISA.14.21	Prepare a place of slaughter for his sons 
ISA.14.21	because of the sin of their ancestors.
ISA.14.21	Let them not rise and take possession of the earth 
ISA.14.21	or fill up the face of the world with cities.” 
ISA.14.22	“And I will rise up against them,” 
ISA.14.22	declares
ISA.14.22	“and I will cut off name and a remnant from Babylon, 
ISA.14.22	and offspring and posterity,” 
ISA.14.22	declares
ISA.14.23	“And I will make her a possession of the hedgehog, 
ISA.14.23	and pools of water, 
ISA.14.23	and I will sweep her away with the broom of destruction,” 
ISA.14.23	declares
ISA.14.24	Yahweh of hosts has sworn, saying, 
ISA.14.24	“Surely
ISA.14.24	And just as I have planned, it shall stand: 
ISA.14.25	to break Assyria in my land, 
ISA.14.25	and I will trample him down on my mountains; 
ISA.14.25	and he shall remove his yoke from them, 
ISA.14.25	and he shall remove his burden from his
ISA.14.26	This is the plan that is planned concerning all of the earth; 
ISA.14.26	and this is the hand that is stretched out over all of the nations. 
ISA.14.27	For Yahweh of hosts has planned, and who will frustrate it? 
ISA.14.27	And his hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back? 
ISA.14.28	In the year of the death of king Ahaz there was this oracle: 
ISA.14.29	You must not rejoice, all you Philistines, 
ISA.14.29	that the rod that struck you is broken, 
ISA.14.29	for a viper will come forth from the root of the snake, 
ISA.14.29	and its fruit will be a flying serpent. 
ISA.14.30	And the firstborn of the poor will graze, 
ISA.14.30	and the needy will lie down in security; 
ISA.14.30	but I will cause your root to die in famine, 
ISA.14.30	and it will kill your remnant. 
ISA.14.31	Wail, gate! Cry, city! 
ISA.14.31	Melt,
ISA.14.31	For smoke is coming from the north, 
ISA.14.31	and there is no straggler in his ranks. 
ISA.14.32	And what will one answer the messengers of the nation? 
ISA.14.32	That Yahweh has founded Zion, 
ISA.14.32	and the needy of his people will take refuge in it. 
ISA.15.1	An oracle of Moab: 
ISA.15.1	Because Ar is devastated in a night, Moab is destroyed; 
ISA.15.1	because Kir of Moab is devastated in a night, it is destroyed. 
ISA.15.2	It has gone up to the house,
ISA.15.2	and Dibon to the high places 
ISA.15.2	for weeping over Nebo, 
ISA.15.2	and Moab wails over Medeba. 
ISA.15.2	Every head is bald,
ISA.15.2	every beard is shaved. 
ISA.15.3	They gird themselves with sackcloth in its streets; 
ISA.15.3	on its roofs and public squares everyone wails, 
ISA.15.3	going down in weeping. 
ISA.15.4	And Heshbon and Elealeh cry
ISA.15.4	their voice is heard as far as Jahaz; 
ISA.15.4	therefore the armed ones of Moab cry out; 
ISA.15.4	its soul quivers
ISA.15.5	My heart cries out for Moab; 
ISA.15.5	its fugitives flee up to Zoar, 
ISA.15.5	to Eglath-shelishiyah. 
ISA.15.5	For at the ascent of Luhith it goes up it with weeping; 
ISA.15.5	for on the road of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction. 
ISA.15.6	For the waters of Nimrim are wastelands; 
ISA.15.6	for the grass has withered, 
ISA.15.6	the vegetation has vanished, 
ISA.15.6	there is no greenness. 
ISA.15.7	Therefore they carry the abundance it has made 
ISA.15.7	and their store of goods over the river of the poplars. 
ISA.15.8	For a cry for help has encircled the territory of Moab, 
ISA.15.8	her wailing is heard as far as Eglaim, 
ISA.15.8	and her wailing as far as Beer Elim. 
ISA.15.9	For the waters of Dimon
ISA.15.9	but I will place added things upon Dimon: 
ISA.15.9	a lion for the survivors
ISA.15.9	and for the remnant of the land. 
ISA.16.1	 Send a ram
ISA.16.1	from Sela across the desert to the mountain of daughter Zion.
ISA.16.2	And this shall be: 
ISA.16.2	like a bird fleeing from a thrust away nest 
ISA.16.2	shall be the daughters of Moab at the fords of Arnon. 
ISA.16.3	“Bring counsel, 
ISA.16.3	make a decision; 
ISA.16.3	make your shade like the night 
ISA.16.3	in the middle of noonday. 
ISA.16.3	Hide the outcasts; 
ISA.16.3	you must not betray the fugitive. 
ISA.16.4	Let my outcasts of Moab dwell as aliens among you; 
ISA.16.4	be a hiding place for them from the presence of the destroyer.” 
ISA.16.4	When the oppressor is no more, destruction has stopped, 
ISA.16.4	the one who tramples has
ISA.16.5	then a throne shall be established in steadfast love, 
ISA.16.5	and one shall sit on it in faithfulness, in the tent of David, 
ISA.16.5	judging and seeking justice 
ISA.16.5	and zealous for righteousness. 
ISA.16.6	We have heard of the pride of Moab—exceedingly proud— 
ISA.16.6	of his arrogance, pride, and insolence; his boasting is not true.
ISA.16.7	Therefore Moab wails; 
ISA.16.7	all of it wails for Moab, 
ISA.16.7	for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth you moan, utterly devastated.
ISA.16.8	For Heshbon withers the fields, the vine of Sibmah; 
ISA.16.8	rulers of nations have broken down her tendrils, 
ISA.16.8	they reached up to Jazer, 
ISA.16.8	they wandered to the desert; 
ISA.16.8	her shoots spread abroad, 
ISA.16.8	they crossed over the sea. 
ISA.16.9	Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah. 
ISA.16.9	I drench you with my tears,
ISA.16.9	for a jubilant shout has fallen over your summer fruit and harvest. 
ISA.16.10	And joy and gladness are
ISA.16.10	and in the vineyards no one exults, 
ISA.16.10	no one shouts for joy; 
ISA.16.10	no treader treads wine in the presses; 
ISA.16.10	I have put to an end to the jubilant shout. 
ISA.16.11	Therefore my heart moans
ISA.16.11	and my inner parts for Kir-heres. 
ISA.16.12	And this shall happen: 
ISA.16.12	when Moab appears, when it is weary upon the high place 
ISA.16.12	and it comes to its sanctuary to pray, it will not prevail. 
ISA.16.13	This was the word that Yahweh spoke to Moab in the past.
ISA.16.14	But now Yahweh speaks, saying, “In three years, like the years of a hired worker, the glory of Moab will become contemptible, with all of the great multitude, and the remnant will be a few, small, not strong. 
ISA.17.1	An oracle of Damascus: 
ISA.17.1	“Look! Damascus will cease being a city 
ISA.17.1	and will become a heap of ruins. 
ISA.17.2	The cities of Aroer will be deserted;
ISA.17.2	they will be for the flocks, 
ISA.17.2	and they will lie down and no one will frighten
ISA.17.3	And the fortified city will disappear from Ephraim, 
ISA.17.3	and the kingdom from Damascus; 
ISA.17.3	and the remnant of Aram will be like the glory of the children of Israel,” 
ISA.17.3	declares
ISA.17.4	“And this shall happen: 
ISA.17.4	On that day, the glory of Jacob will be brought low, 
ISA.17.4	and the fat of his flesh will become lean. 
ISA.17.5	And it shall be as when a reaper gathers
ISA.17.5	and he reaps grain with his arm, 
ISA.17.5	and it shall be like one who gathers ears of grain 
ISA.17.5	in the valley of Rephaim. 
ISA.17.6	And gleanings will be left over in it, as when an olive tree is beaten,
ISA.17.6	two or three ripe olive berries in the top of a branch, 
ISA.17.6	four or five on its fruitful branches,” 
ISA.17.6	declares
ISA.17.7	On that day, mankind will look to its maker, 
ISA.17.7	and its eyes will look to the holy one of Israel; 
ISA.17.8	it will not look to the altars, 
ISA.17.8	the work of its hands, 
ISA.17.8	and it will not see what its fingers made 
ISA.17.8	and the poles of Asherah worship and the incense altars. 
ISA.17.9	On that day, its fortified cities
ISA.17.10	For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, 
ISA.17.10	and you have not remembered the rock of your refuge; 
ISA.17.10	therefore you plant plants of pleasantness, 
ISA.17.10	and you plant
ISA.17.11	On your planting day you make them grow, 
ISA.17.11	and in the morning of your sowing you bring them into bloom, 
ISA.17.11	yet the harvest will flee
ISA.17.12	Ah! The noise of many peoples, they make a noise like the noise of the seas! 
ISA.17.12	And the roar of nations, they roar like the roar of mighty waters! 
ISA.17.13	The nations roar like the roar of many waters, 
ISA.17.13	but he will rebuke him, and he will flee far away. 
ISA.17.13	And they are chased like chaff of the mountains before the wind 
ISA.17.13	and like tumbleweed before the storm. 
ISA.17.14	At the time of evening, and look, terror! 
ISA.17.14	Before morning he is no more. 
ISA.17.14	This is the fate of those who plunder us 
ISA.17.14	and the lot of those who plunder us. 
ISA.18.1	Ah! land of the whirring of wings, 
ISA.18.1	which is beyond the rivers of Cush, 
ISA.18.2	that sends messengers by the sea 
ISA.18.2	and in vessels of papyrus on the surface of the waters! 
ISA.18.2	Go, swift messengers, to a tall
ISA.18.2	to a people feared near and far,
ISA.18.2	a mighty, mighty
ISA.18.2	whose land rivers divide. 
ISA.18.3	All you inhabitants of the world 
ISA.18.3	and dwellers of the earth, 
ISA.18.3	when a signal is raised on the
ISA.18.3	and when a trumpet is blown,
ISA.18.4	For Yahweh said this to me: 
ISA.18.4	“I will be quiet, 
ISA.18.4	and I will look from my dwelling place 
ISA.18.4	like clear heat because of light,
ISA.18.4	like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.” 
ISA.18.5	For before the harvest, when the blossom is complete
ISA.18.5	and a blossom becomes ripening fruit, 
ISA.18.5	and one cuts off the shoots with pruning hooks, 
ISA.18.5	and one removes, tears away the tendrils. 
ISA.18.6	They shall all be left
ISA.18.6	and for the animals
ISA.18.6	And the birds
ISA.18.6	and every animal of the earth will winter on it. 
ISA.18.7	At that time, a gift
ISA.18.7	from a tall
ISA.18.7	and from a people feared near and far, 
ISA.18.7	a mighty, mighty and trampling nation, 
ISA.18.7	whose land the rivers divide, 
ISA.18.7	to the place of the name of Yahweh of hosts, 
ISA.18.7	the mountain of Zion. 
ISA.19.1	An oracle of Egypt: 
ISA.19.1	Look! Yahweh is riding on a swift cloud 
ISA.19.1	and is coming to Egypt. 
ISA.19.1	And the idols of Egypt will tremble in front of him, 
ISA.19.1	and the heart of Egypt melts in his inner parts. 
ISA.19.2	“And I will stir up Egyptians
ISA.19.2	and each one will fight against his brother 
ISA.19.2	and each one against his neighbor, 
ISA.19.2	city against city, kingdom against kingdom. 
ISA.19.3	And the spirit of the Egyptians
ISA.19.3	and I will confuse
ISA.19.3	and they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead, 
ISA.19.3	and the ghosts and the spiritists. 
ISA.19.4	And I will hand over the Egyptians
ISA.19.4	and a powerful king will rule over them,” 
ISA.19.4	declares
ISA.19.5	And the waters will be dried up from the sea, 
ISA.19.5	and the river will be parched and dry. 
ISA.19.6	And the rivers will become foul-smelling; 
ISA.19.6	the branches of the Nile of Egypt will become little and dry up; 
ISA.19.6	reed and rush will wither. 
ISA.19.7	Bare places by the Nile will be dried up, 
ISA.19.7	by the edge of the Nile and all the sown land of the Nile; 
ISA.19.7	it will be driven about, and it will be no more.
ISA.19.8	And the fishers will mourn, 
ISA.19.8	and all of those who cast fishhooks
ISA.19.8	and those who spread out fishing nets
ISA.19.9	And the workers of combed flax will be ashamed, 
ISA.19.9	and those who weave white linen. 
ISA.19.10	And her weavers will be crushed; 
ISA.19.10	all the hired workers
ISA.19.11	Surely the princes of Zoan are foolish; 
ISA.19.11	the wise of the counselors of Pharaoh give senseless counsel. 
ISA.19.11	How can you say to Pharaoh, 
ISA.19.11	“I myself am a son of sages, 
ISA.19.11	a descendant
ISA.19.12	Where are your sages then? 
ISA.19.12	Now, let them tell you, 
ISA.19.12	and let them know what Yahweh of hosts has planned against Egypt. 
ISA.19.13	The princes of Zoan have become foolish; 
ISA.19.13	the princes of Memphis are deceived; 
ISA.19.13	the leaders of her tribes have led Egypt astray. 
ISA.19.14	Yahweh has mixed a spirit of confusion into her midst, 
ISA.19.14	and they have caused Egypt to stagger in all of its doings, 
ISA.19.14	as when a drunkard staggers
ISA.19.15	And there will be nothing for Egypt to do,
ISA.19.15	head or tail, palm branch or reed. 
ISA.19.16	On that day, Egypt will be like women, and will tremble and be afraid before the waving hand of Yahweh of hosts that he is waving against it. 
ISA.19.17	And the land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt, everyone to whom one mentions it will be afraid in himself because of the plan of Yahweh of hosts that he is planning against him. 
ISA.19.18	On that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language
ISA.19.19	On that day, there will be an altar for Yahweh in in the middle of the land of Egypt, and a stone pillar for Yahweh at her border. 
ISA.19.20	And it will be a sign and a witness to Yahweh of hosts in the land of Egypt; when they cry out to Yahweh because of oppressors, he will send them a savior and a defender,
ISA.19.21	And Yahweh will make himself known to Egypt, and Egypt will know Yahweh on that day, and they will worship with sacrifice and offering, and they will make vows
ISA.19.22	And Yahweh will strike Egypt, striking and healing; and they will return to Yahweh, and he will respond to their prayer, and he will heal them. 
ISA.19.23	On that day, there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria will come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, and Egypt will worship together with Assyria. 
ISA.19.24	On that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth, 
ISA.19.25	whom Yahweh of hosts blessed, saying, “May Egypt my people be blessed, and Assyria, the work of my hands, and my inheritance, Israel.” 
ISA.20.1	In the year the commander-in-chief came
ISA.20.2	at that time, Yahweh had spoken by the hand of Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, 
ISA.20.2	“Go and loosen the sackcloth from your loins, 
ISA.20.2	and take off your sandals
ISA.20.2	and he had done so, walking naked and barefoot. 
ISA.20.3	Then
ISA.20.4	so shall the king of Assyria lead the captives
ISA.20.5	And they shall be dismayed, 
ISA.20.5	and they shall be ashamed 
ISA.20.5	because of Cush, their hope, 
ISA.20.5	and because of Egypt, their pride. 
ISA.20.6	And the inhabitant
ISA.20.6	‘Look! This is our hope to whom we fled for help, to be delivered from
ISA.21.1	The oracle of the wilderness of the sea: 
ISA.21.1	As storm winds passing over in the Negev, 
ISA.21.1	it comes
ISA.21.1	from a frightful land. 
ISA.21.2	A hard revelation is told to me; 
ISA.21.2	the treacherous deals treacherously, 
ISA.21.2	and the destroyer destroys. 
ISA.21.2	Go up, Elam; 
ISA.21.2	lay siege, Media! 
ISA.21.2	I put an end to all of her sighing. 
ISA.21.3	Therefore my loins are filled with anguish; 
ISA.21.3	pangs have seized me, like the pangs of a woman giving birth. 
ISA.21.3	I am too bent to hear,
ISA.21.3	I am too dismayed to see.
ISA.21.4	My mind
ISA.21.4	the twilight I desired
ISA.21.5	Set out the table in order! 
ISA.21.5	Spread out the rugs!
ISA.21.5	Eat! drink! 
ISA.21.5	Rise up, commanders; 
ISA.21.5	smear
ISA.21.6	For the Lord said this to me: 
ISA.21.6	“Go, set a watchman in position. 
ISA.21.6	He must announce what he sees. 
ISA.21.7	When
ISA.21.7	a pair of horsemen, 
ISA.21.7	riders
ISA.21.7	riders
ISA.21.7	then
ISA.21.7	paying attention, paying special
ISA.21.8	Then
ISA.21.8	“Lord, I am standing on the watchtower continually by day, 
ISA.21.8	and I am standing at my post throughout
ISA.21.9	And look at this! A man’s a chariot is coming, 
ISA.21.9	a pair of horsemen!” 
ISA.21.9	Then
ISA.21.9	“It has fallen! Babylon has fallen! 
ISA.21.9	And all the images of her gods are
ISA.21.10	My downtrodden people 
ISA.21.10	and the son of my threshing floor, 
ISA.21.10	I will announce to you what I have heard from Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel. 
ISA.21.11	The oracle of Dumah: 
ISA.21.11	One is calling to me from Seir, 
ISA.21.11	“Watchman, what of
ISA.21.11	Watchman, what of
ISA.21.12	The watchman says, 
ISA.21.12	“Morning comes, 
ISA.21.12	and also the night. 
ISA.21.12	If you will inquire, inquire; 
ISA.21.12	come back again.”
ISA.21.13	An oracle concerning
ISA.21.13	You will spend the night in the thicket in a desert-plateau,
ISA.21.13	caravans of Dedanites. 
ISA.21.14	When you happen to meet
ISA.21.14	Inhabitants of the land of Tema came to meet the fugitive with his bread. 
ISA.21.15	For they have fled from the swords, 
ISA.21.15	from the drawn sword and the bent bow, 
ISA.21.15	and from the heaviness of the battle. 
ISA.21.16	For the Lord said this to me: 
ISA.21.16	“In one more year,
ISA.21.16	all the glory of Kedar will come to an end. 
ISA.21.17	And the remainder of the number of the bows
ISA.21.17	For Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken. 
ISA.22.1	The oracle of the valley of vision: 
ISA.22.1	What business do you have going
ISA.22.2	noisy,
ISA.22.2	exultant town? 
ISA.22.2	Your slain are not slain by the sword, 
ISA.22.2	nor are they dead from battle. 
ISA.22.3	All of your rulers have fled together without a bow; 
ISA.22.3	all of you who were found
ISA.22.3	They were captured together; 
ISA.22.3	they had fled far away. 
ISA.22.4	Therefore I said, 
ISA.22.4	“Look away from me, 
ISA.22.4	let me weep bitterly;
ISA.22.4	you must not insist on comforting me 
ISA.22.4	for the destruction of the daughter of my people.” 
ISA.22.5	For the Lord Yahweh of hosts has a day of tumult and trampling and confusion
ISA.22.5	a tearing down of walls
ISA.22.6	And Elam lifted up the quiver, 
ISA.22.6	with chariots
ISA.22.6	And Kir uncovered the shield. 
ISA.22.7	And this happened: 
ISA.22.7	the choicest of your valleys were full of chariots,
ISA.22.7	and the cavalry confidently stood at the gate. 
ISA.22.8	And he uncovered the covering of Judah. 
ISA.22.8	And you looked, on that day, to the weapons
ISA.22.9	and you saw that the breaches in the walls of the city of David were many, 
ISA.22.9	and you gathered the waters of the lower pool. 
ISA.22.10	And you counted the houses of Jerusalem, 
ISA.22.10	and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. 
ISA.22.11	And you made a reservoir between the walls for the waters of the old pool, 
ISA.22.11	but you did not look to its maker, 
ISA.22.11	and you did not see the one who created it long ago.
ISA.22.12	And the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, called on that day 
ISA.22.12	for weeping and mourning, 
ISA.22.12	and for baldness and girding with
ISA.22.13	But look! Joy and gladness, 
ISA.22.13	the killing of oxen
ISA.22.13	the eating of meat and the drinking of wine! 
ISA.22.13	“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!” 
ISA.22.14	And it was revealed in my ears by Yahweh of hosts: 
ISA.22.14	“Surely this sin will not be atoned for you until you die!” 
ISA.22.14	says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts. 
ISA.22.15	The Lord, Yahweh of hosts, says this: 
ISA.22.15	“Go! Go to this steward, to Shebna, 
ISA.22.15	who is over the house: 
ISA.22.16	‘What business do you have
ISA.22.16	and who do you have
ISA.22.16	that you have cut a grave cutting here for yourself, 
ISA.22.16	carving his grave on the height, 
ISA.22.16	a dwelling place for him in the rock? 
ISA.22.17	Look! Yahweh is about to really hurl
ISA.22.17	And he is about to grasp you firmly; 
ISA.22.18	he will wind a winding tightly around you like a ball, to a wide land.
ISA.22.18	There you shall die, 
ISA.22.18	and there the chariots of your splendor will be, 
ISA.22.18	disgrace to your master’s house! 
ISA.22.19	And I will push you from your office, 
ISA.22.19	and he will throw you down from your position. 
ISA.22.20	And this shall happen: 
ISA.22.20	On that day I will call to my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah, 
ISA.22.21	and I will clothe him with your tunic, 
ISA.22.21	and I will bind your sash firmly about him, 
ISA.22.21	and I will put your authority into his hand, 
ISA.22.21	and he shall be like a father to the inhabitants
ISA.22.21	and to the house of Judah. 
ISA.22.22	And I will put the key of the house of David on his shoulder, 
ISA.22.22	and he shall open and no one will be able to shut; 
ISA.22.22	and he shall shut and no one will be able to open. 
ISA.22.23	And I will drive him in like a peg into a secure place, 
ISA.22.23	and he will become like a throne of glory to the house of his father. 
ISA.22.24	And they will hang all of the heaviness of his father’s house on him, 
ISA.22.24	the offspring and the offshoot, 
ISA.22.24	all of the small vessels, 
ISA.22.24	from the bowls to the jars.
ISA.22.25	On that day, declares
ISA.23.1	The oracle of Tyre: 
ISA.23.1	Wail, ships of Tarshish, for the house is destroyed so that no one can enter;
ISA.23.1	it is announced to them from the land of Cyprus. 
ISA.23.2	Be still, inhabitants of the coast, 
ISA.23.2	merchant of Sidon, who travels over the sea, they filled you. 
ISA.23.3	And on the great waters is the seed of Shihor, 
ISA.23.3	the harvest of the Nile is its produce, 
ISA.23.3	and she was the merchandise of the nations. 
ISA.23.4	Be ashamed, Sidon, for the sea, 
ISA.23.4	the fortress of the sea said, saying, 
ISA.23.4	“I was not in labor, 
ISA.23.4	and I have not given birth, 
ISA.23.4	and I have not reared young men, 
ISA.23.4	brought
ISA.23.5	When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report about
ISA.23.6	Cross over to Tarshish! 
ISA.23.6	Wail, inhabitants of the coast! 
ISA.23.7	Is this your exultant one,
ISA.23.7	Her feet brought her to dwell afar as an alien. 
ISA.23.8	Who has planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns,
ISA.23.8	whose merchants were princes, 
ISA.23.8	her traders the honored ones of the earth? 
ISA.23.9	Yahweh of hosts has planned it: 
ISA.23.9	to defile the pride of all glory, 
ISA.23.9	to humble all the honored ones of the earth. 
ISA.23.10	Cross over your own land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish; 
ISA.23.10	there is no longer a harbor.
ISA.23.11	He has stretched his hand out over the sea; 
ISA.23.11	he has made kingdoms shake. 
ISA.23.11	Yahweh has commanded concerning Canaan to destroy her fortresses. 
ISA.23.12	And he said, 
ISA.23.12	“You will not continue
ISA.23.12	Arise, cross over to Cyprus! There will be no rest for you even there.” 
ISA.23.13	Look at the land of the Chaldeans! This people no longer exists. 
ISA.23.13	Assyria destined
ISA.23.13	They erected its siege towers; 
ISA.23.13	they demolished its citadel fortresses. 
ISA.23.13	It made her like a ruin. 
ISA.23.14	Wail, ships of Tarshish! For your fortress is destroyed. 
ISA.23.15	And this will happen on that day: 
ISA.23.15	And Tyre will be forgotten seventy years,
ISA.23.15	like the days of one king. 
ISA.23.15	At the end of seventy years,
ISA.23.16	“Take a harp, 
ISA.23.16	go around the city, forgotten prostitute! 
ISA.23.16	Do it well, playing a stringed instrument! 
ISA.23.16	Make numerous songs,
ISA.23.17	And this shall happen: 
ISA.23.17	at the end of seventy years,
ISA.23.17	and she will return to her harlot’s wages, 
ISA.23.17	and she will commit fornication 
ISA.23.17	with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth. 
ISA.23.18	And this shall happen: 
ISA.23.18	her merchandise and her harlot’s wages will be set apart for Yahweh; 
ISA.23.18	it will not be stored up, 
ISA.23.18	and it will not be hoarded, 
ISA.23.18	but her merchandise will be for those who live before the presence
ISA.23.18	for eating to satiation and for fine clothing. 
ISA.24.1	Look! Yahweh is about to lay the earth waste 
ISA.24.1	and is about to devastate it, 
ISA.24.1	and he will twist her surface, 
ISA.24.1	and he will scatter her inhabitants. 
ISA.24.2	And it shall be as with the people, so with the priest; 
ISA.24.2	as with the slave, so with his master; 
ISA.24.2	as with the female slave, so with her mistress; 
ISA.24.2	as with the buyer, so with the seller; 
ISA.24.2	as with the lender, so with the borrower; 
ISA.24.2	as with the creditor, so with the one to whom he lends. 
ISA.24.3	The earth shall be utterly laid waste, 
ISA.24.3	and it shall be utterly plundered, 
ISA.24.3	for Yahweh has spoken this word. 
ISA.24.4	The earth dries up, it withers; 
ISA.24.4	the world languishes, it withers. 
ISA.24.4	The elevated of the people of the earth languish, 
ISA.24.5	and the earth is defiled beneath its inhabitants. 
ISA.24.5	For they have transgressed laws; 
ISA.24.5	they have passed by statutes;
ISA.24.5	they have broken the everlasting covenant. 
ISA.24.6	Therefore a curse devours the earth, 
ISA.24.6	and the inhabitants in it suffer for their guilt. 
ISA.24.6	Therefore the inhabitants of the earth burn, 
ISA.24.6	and few men are left.
ISA.24.7	The new wine dries up; 
ISA.24.7	the vine languishes. 
ISA.24.7	All the merry of heart sigh; 
ISA.24.8	the joy of the tambourine has stopped. 
ISA.24.8	The noise of the jubilant has ceased; 
ISA.24.8	the joy of the lyre has stopped. 
ISA.24.9	They do not drink wine with song; 
ISA.24.9	strong drink is bitter to those who drink it. 
ISA.24.10	The city of emptiness is broken; 
ISA.24.10	every house is shut so that no one can enter;
ISA.24.11	there is an outcry over the wine in the streets. 
ISA.24.11	All joy turns into darkness;
ISA.24.11	the joy of the earth disappears. 
ISA.24.12	Desolation is left in the city; 
ISA.24.12	the gate is crushed into a state of ruin. 
ISA.24.13	For it shall be like this in the midst of the earth, 
ISA.24.13	among the nations, 
ISA.24.13	like the beating of an olive tree, 
ISA.24.13	like gleanings when a grape harvest is at an end. 
ISA.24.14	They lift up their voices;
ISA.24.14	they shout out from the west over the majesty of Yahweh. 
ISA.24.15	Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east, 
ISA.24.15	the name of Yahweh the God of Israel in the coastlands of the sea. 
ISA.24.16	We hear songs from the edge
ISA.24.16	“Glory to the righteous one!” 
ISA.24.16	But I say, “Ruin to me! 
ISA.24.16	Ruin to me! Woe to me! 
ISA.24.16	The treacherous ones deal treacherously, 
ISA.24.16	and the treacherous ones deal treacherously with treachery!” 
ISA.24.17	Terror and the pit and the snare are upon you, inhabitants
ISA.24.18	And this shall happen: 
ISA.24.18	The one who flees from the sound of the terror shall fall into the pit, 
ISA.24.18	and the one who goes up from inside the pit
ISA.24.18	for the windows from heaven are opened, 
ISA.24.18	and the foundations of the earth tremble. 
ISA.24.19	The earth is utterly broken; 
ISA.24.19	the earth is torn asunder; 
ISA.24.19	the earth is shaken violently. 
ISA.24.20	The earth staggers to and fro like the drunkard, 
ISA.24.20	and it sways like a hut, 
ISA.24.20	and its transgression is heavy upon it, 
ISA.24.20	and it falls and does not rise again. 
ISA.24.21	And this shall happen on that day: 
ISA.24.21	Yahweh will punish the host of heaven in heaven, 
ISA.24.21	and the kings of the earth on the earth. 
ISA.24.22	And they will be gathered in a gathering, like a prisoner in
ISA.24.22	And they will be shut in
ISA.24.23	And the full moon will be ashamed 
ISA.24.23	and the sun will be ashamed, 
ISA.24.23	for Yahweh of hosts will rule on Mount Zion
ISA.24.23	and before his elders in glory. 
ISA.25.1	Yahweh, you are my God; I will exalt you. 
ISA.25.1	I will praise your name, 
ISA.25.1	for you have done wonderful things,
ISA.25.1	plans
ISA.25.2	For you have made
ISA.25.2	the fortified city a ruin, 
ISA.25.2	the palace of foreigners is no longer
ISA.25.2	it will never
ISA.25.3	Therefore strong peoples will glorify you; 
ISA.25.3	a city of ruthless nations, they will fear you. 
ISA.25.4	For you have been a refuge to the poor, 
ISA.25.4	a refuge to the needy in his distress, 
ISA.25.4	a shelter from the rainstorm, 
ISA.25.4	a shade from the heat. 
ISA.25.4	For the breath of the ruthless was like a rainstorm against a wall,
ISA.25.5	the noise of foreigners like heat in a dry land. 
ISA.25.5	You subdued the heat with the shade of a cloud; 
ISA.25.5	the song of the ruthless was silenced. 
ISA.25.6	And on this mountain Yahweh of hosts will make for all peoples a rich feast,
ISA.25.6	a feast of aged wines, fat filled with marrow, filtered aged wine. 
ISA.25.7	And on this mountain he will destroy
ISA.25.7	the shroud over all peoples, 
ISA.25.7	and the woven covering over all nations. 
ISA.25.8	He will destroy
ISA.25.8	and the Lord Yahweh will wipe off the tears from all faces, 
ISA.25.8	and he will remove the disgrace of his people from all the earth, 
ISA.25.8	for Yahweh has spoken. 
ISA.25.9	And one will say, on that day, 
ISA.25.9	“Look! This is our God! We have waited for him and he saved us! 
ISA.25.9	This is Yahweh; we waited for him! 
ISA.25.9	Let us be glad, 
ISA.25.9	and let us rejoice in his salvation.” 
ISA.25.10	For the hand of Yahweh will rest on this mountain, 
ISA.25.10	and Moab shall be trampled down under him 
ISA.25.10	as a heap of straw is trampled down
ISA.25.11	And it
ISA.25.11	just as the swimmer spreads out to swim, 
ISA.25.11	and its pride will be brought low with the movement
ISA.25.12	And he will throw down the fortification of the high point of your walls; 
ISA.25.12	he will bring it low; 
ISA.25.12	he will send it
ISA.25.12	to the dust. 
ISA.26.1	On that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah: 
ISA.26.1	“We have a strong city;
ISA.26.1	he sets up victory like walls and ramparts!
ISA.26.2	Open the gates so that
ISA.26.3	You will protect a firm inclination in peace, 
ISA.26.3	in peace because he trusts in you. 
ISA.26.4	Trust in Yahweh forever, 
ISA.26.4	for in Yah, Yahweh you have an everlasting rock. 
ISA.26.5	For he has thrown down the inhabitants of the height, 
ISA.26.5	he lays low the lofty city. 
ISA.26.5	He lays it low to the ground; 
ISA.26.5	he throws her to the dust. 
ISA.26.6	The foot tramples it, 
ISA.26.6	the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.” 
ISA.26.7	The way of the righteous is a straight path; 
ISA.26.7	you clear the level path of the righteous.
ISA.26.8	Surely we wait for you in the path of your judgments, Yahweh, 
ISA.26.8	for your name and renown are the desire of the soul. 
ISA.26.9	I desire you with all my soul in the night; 
ISA.26.9	also I seek you with my spirit within me, 
ISA.26.9	for when your judgments are upon
ISA.26.9	the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. 
ISA.26.10	Though the wicked person is shown compassion, he does not learn righteousness; 
ISA.26.10	he acts unjustly in the land of uprightness, 
ISA.26.10	and he does not see the majesty of Yahweh. 
ISA.26.11	Yahweh, though your hand reaches high, they do not see it. 
ISA.26.11	Let them see, and let them be ashamed of the zeal of people. 
ISA.26.11	Indeed, let the fire of your enemies consume them. 
ISA.26.12	Yahweh, you will establish peace for us, 
ISA.26.12	for you have done even all of our works for us. 
ISA.26.13	Yahweh, our God, lords besides you ruled over us, 
ISA.26.13	but we praise your name alone.
ISA.26.14	The dead do not live; 
ISA.26.14	dead spirits do not rise 
ISA.26.14	because you have punished and destroyed them, 
ISA.26.14	and you have destroyed all memory of them. 
ISA.26.15	You have added to the nation, Yahweh. 
ISA.26.15	You have added to the nation; you are honored. 
ISA.26.15	You have extended all the ends of the land. 
ISA.26.16	Yahweh, in distress they have visited you; 
ISA.26.16	they poured out an incantation;
ISA.26.16	your discipline was on them. 
ISA.26.17	Like a pregnant woman on the point of giving birth, she writhes; 
ISA.26.17	she cries in her labor pains. 
ISA.26.17	So we were because of your presence, Yahweh. 
ISA.26.18	We became pregnant, we writhed; 
ISA.26.18	we gave birth to wind. 
ISA.26.18	We cannot bring about deliverance on the earth, 
ISA.26.18	and no inhabitants of the world are born. 
ISA.26.19	Your dead shall live; their corpses
ISA.26.19	Wake up and sing for joy, dwellers of the dust, 
ISA.26.19	for your dew is celestial dew,
ISA.26.19	and the earth will give birth to dead spirits.
ISA.26.20	Go, my people, enter into your chambers 
ISA.26.20	and shut your doors
ISA.26.20	hide for a very little
ISA.26.20	until the wrath has passed over. 
ISA.26.21	For look! Yahweh is about to come out from his place 
ISA.26.21	to punish the iniquity of the inhabitants
ISA.26.21	and the earth will disclose her blood 
ISA.26.21	and will no longer cover her slain. 
ISA.27.1	On that day, Yahweh will punish with his cruel, great and strong sword Leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and Leviathan, the twisting serpent, and he will kill the sea monster that is in the sea. 
ISA.27.2	On that day: 
ISA.27.2	“A vineyard of beauty! Sing in praise of it! 
ISA.27.3	I, Yahweh, am her keeper; I water it again and again.
ISA.27.3	Lest one afflict harm on it, I guard it night and day; 
ISA.27.4	I have no wrath.
ISA.27.4	Whatever gives me thorns and briers, 
ISA.27.4	I will step forth against in battle. 
ISA.27.4	I will set it on fire altogether. 
ISA.27.5	Or let it grasp at my protection; 
ISA.27.5	let it make peace with me; 
ISA.27.5	peace let it make with me.” 
ISA.27.6	Days are coming,
ISA.27.6	Israel will blossom and send out shoots, 
ISA.27.6	and they will fill the face of the world with fruit. 
ISA.27.7	Does he strike him as he struck down those who struck him?
ISA.27.7	Or is he killed as those who killed him were killed?
ISA.27.8	By expelling
ISA.27.8	He removed them with his strong wind, 
ISA.27.8	in the day of the east wind. 
ISA.27.9	Therefore by this he will make atonement for the guilt of Jacob, 
ISA.27.9	and this will be all of the fruit of the removal of his sin: 
ISA.27.9	when he makes
ISA.27.9	no poles of Asherah worship or incense altars will stand. 
ISA.27.10	For the fortified city is solitary, 
ISA.27.10	a settlement deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness; 
ISA.27.10	the calf grazes there, 
ISA.27.10	lies down there and destroys its branches. 
ISA.27.11	When its branches are dry,
ISA.27.11	women are coming and setting light to it. 
ISA.27.11	For it is not a people of understanding; 
ISA.27.11	therefore his maker will not have compassion on him, 
ISA.27.11	and his creator will not show him favor. 
ISA.27.12	And this shall happen: 
ISA.27.12	on that day, Yahweh will thresh from the floodwaters of the Euphrates to the wadi
ISA.27.13	And this shall happen: 
ISA.27.13	on that day, a great trumpet will be blown, 
ISA.27.13	and those who were lost in the land of Assyria will come, 
ISA.27.13	and those who were scattered in the land of Egypt, 
ISA.27.13	and they will bow down to Yahweh on the holy mountain
ISA.28.1	Ah! The garland of the pride of the drunkards of Ephraim 
ISA.28.1	and the withering flower of the glory of his beauty, 
ISA.28.1	which is at the head of the rich valley,
ISA.28.2	Look! The Lord has a mighty and strong one, 
ISA.28.2	like a rainstorm of hail, a wind storm of destruction, 
ISA.28.2	like a rainstorm of mighty overflowing waters, 
ISA.28.2	he will put them to the earth with his hand. 
ISA.28.3	The garland of the pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trampled
ISA.28.4	and the withering flower of the glory of its beauty which is at the head of the rich valley
ISA.28.4	which the one who sees it swallows
ISA.28.5	In that day, Yahweh of hosts will become a garland of glory 
ISA.28.5	and a diadem of beauty to the remnant of his people, 
ISA.28.6	and a spirit of justice to the one who sits over judgment, 
ISA.28.6	and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate. 
ISA.28.7	And these also stagger because of wine 
ISA.28.7	and stagger because of strong drink; 
ISA.28.7	priest and prophet stagger because of strong drink; 
ISA.28.7	they are confused
ISA.28.7	They stagger because of strong drink; 
ISA.28.7	they err in vision. 
ISA.28.7	They stagger in the rendering of a decision, 
ISA.28.8	for all the tables are full of disgusting vomit, with no place left.
ISA.28.9	To whom will he teach knowledge, 
ISA.28.9	and to whom will he explain the message? 
ISA.28.9	Those who are weaned from milk, 
ISA.28.9	those taken from the breast? 
ISA.28.10	For it is blah-blah upon blah-blah, 
ISA.28.10	blah-blah upon blah-blah, 
ISA.28.10	gah-gah upon gah-gah, 
ISA.28.10	gah-gah upon gah-gah,
ISA.28.10	a little here, a little there. 
ISA.28.11	For he will speak with stammering
ISA.28.12	to whom he has said, 
ISA.28.12	“This is rest; give rest to the weary; 
ISA.28.12	and this is repose”; yet
ISA.28.13	And to them the word of Yahweh will be 
ISA.28.13	blah-blah upon blah-blah 
ISA.28.13	blah-blah upon blah-blah 
ISA.28.13	gah-gah upon gah-gah 
ISA.28.13	gah-gah upon gah-gah,
ISA.28.13	a little here, a little there, 
ISA.28.13	so that they may go and stumble backward 
ISA.28.13	and be broken and ensnared and captured. 
ISA.28.14	Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, men of mockery, 
ISA.28.14	rulers of these people in Jerusalem: 
ISA.28.15	Because you have said, 
ISA.28.15	“We have made
ISA.28.15	and we have made an agreement with Sheol. 
ISA.28.15	The overwhelming flood, when it passes through, will not come to us, 
ISA.28.15	for we have made lies
ISA.28.15	and we have hidden ourselves in falsehood.” 
ISA.28.16	Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: 
ISA.28.16	“Look! I am laying a stone in Zion, 
ISA.28.16	a tested
ISA.28.16	a precious cornerstone, 
ISA.28.16	a founded foundation: 
ISA.28.16	‘The one who trusts will not panic.’
ISA.28.17	And I will make justice the measuring line, 
ISA.28.17	and righteousness the plumb line; 
ISA.28.17	and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,
ISA.28.17	and waters will flood over the hiding place. 
ISA.28.18	And your covenant with death will be annulled, 
ISA.28.18	and your agreement with Sheol will not stand; 
ISA.28.18	you will become a trampling place for the overwhelming flood when it passes through. 
ISA.28.19	As often as it passes through,
ISA.28.19	for morning by morning
ISA.28.19	in the day and in the night, 
ISA.28.19	and understanding the message will be only terror.” 
ISA.28.20	For the bed is too short to stretch out on,
ISA.28.20	and the covering is too narrow when wrapping oneself. 
ISA.28.21	For Yahweh will rise up as at Mount Perazim; 
ISA.28.21	he will rave as in the valley at Gibeon 
ISA.28.21	to do his deed—his deed is strange— 
ISA.28.21	and to work his work—his work is alien! 
ISA.28.22	And now you must not scoff, 
ISA.28.22	or your bonds will be strong, 
ISA.28.22	for I have heard from the Lord, Yahweh of hosts: 
ISA.28.22	complete destruction 
ISA.28.22	decreed upon all the land. 
ISA.28.23	Listen, and hear my voice! 
ISA.28.23	Listen attentively, and hear my word! 
ISA.28.24	Is it all day that the plowman plows, 
ISA.28.24	opens to sow seed, harrows his ground? 
ISA.28.25	When he has leveled its surface,
ISA.28.25	and sow cumin seed, 
ISA.28.25	and plant
ISA.28.25	and barley in an appointed place, 
ISA.28.25	and spelt grain as its border? 
ISA.28.26	And his God instructs him about the prescription;
ISA.28.26	he teaches him. 
ISA.28.27	For dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, 
ISA.28.27	nor is a wheel of a utility cart rolled
ISA.28.27	but dill is beaten out with a stick, 
ISA.28.27	and cumin with a rod. 
ISA.28.28	Grain is crushed fine, 
ISA.28.28	but certainly one does not thresh it forever; 
ISA.28.28	and one drives the wheel of his cart, 
ISA.28.28	but his horses do not crush it. 
ISA.28.29	This also comes forth from Yahweh of hosts. 
ISA.28.29	He is wonderful in advice; 
ISA.28.29	he makes great wisdom. 
ISA.29.1	Ah! Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! 
ISA.29.1	Add year to year, 
ISA.29.1	let festivals recur. 
ISA.29.2	Yet
ISA.29.2	and there shall be mourning and lamentation, 
ISA.29.2	and it shall be to me like an altar hearth.
ISA.29.3	And I will encamp in a circle
ISA.29.3	and I will lay siege to you with towers
ISA.29.3	and I will raise up siegeworks against you. 
ISA.29.4	Then
ISA.29.4	you shall speak from the earth, 
ISA.29.4	and your words
ISA.29.4	And your voice will be from the earth, like a ghost, 
ISA.29.4	and your word will whisper from the dust. 
ISA.29.5	But
ISA.29.5	and the multitude of tyrants like chaff that passes by. 
ISA.29.5	And it will happen in an instant, suddenly. 
ISA.29.6	You will be punished by Yahweh of hosts 
ISA.29.6	with thunder and earthquake and great sound, 
ISA.29.6	storm wind and tempest and the flame of a devouring fire. 
ISA.29.7	And the multitude of all the nations who fight against Ariel, 
ISA.29.7	all those who fight against her and her stronghold, 
ISA.29.7	and those who inflict her shall be like a dream, a vision of the night. 
ISA.29.8	And it shall be as when the hungry person dreams—look, he is eating! And he wakes up and his inner self is empty. 
ISA.29.8	Or
ISA.29.8	So shall be the multitude of all the nations who fight against Mount Zion. 
ISA.29.9	Be astonished and be amazed! 
ISA.29.9	Blind yourselves and be blinded! 
ISA.29.9	They are drunk but
ISA.29.9	they stagger but
ISA.29.10	For Yahweh has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep, 
ISA.29.10	and he has shut your eyes, the prophets, 
ISA.29.10	and he has covered your heads, the seers. 
ISA.29.11	And the vision of all this has become for you like the words of a sealed document. 
ISA.29.11	When they give it to one who knows the
ISA.29.12	And if the document is given to one who does not know how to read,
ISA.29.13	And the Lord said, 
ISA.29.13	“Because this people draw near with its mouth, 
ISA.29.13	and with its lips it honors me, 
ISA.29.13	and its heart is far from me, 
ISA.29.13	and their fear of me is a commandment of men that has been taught, 
ISA.29.14	therefore look, I am again doing something spectacular and a spectacle with this spectacular people. 
ISA.29.14	And the wisdom of its wise men shall perish, 
ISA.29.14	and the discernment of its discerning ones shall keep itself hidden.” 
ISA.29.15	Ah! Those who make a plan deep, to hide it from Yahweh, 
ISA.29.15	and their deeds are
ISA.29.15	And they say, “Who sees us? 
ISA.29.15	And who knows us?” 
ISA.29.16	Your perversity! 
ISA.29.16	As if a potter
ISA.29.16	and the thing made into shape says of its potter,
ISA.29.17	In a very little while
ISA.29.17	and the fruitful land be regarded as a forest? 
ISA.29.18	And on that day, the deaf shall hear the words of a scroll, 
ISA.29.18	and the eyes of the blind shall see out of gloom and darkness. 
ISA.29.19	And the meek have joy after joy
ISA.29.19	and the needy of the people shall rejoice in the holy one of Israel. 
ISA.29.20	For the tyrant shall be no more, 
ISA.29.20	and the scoffer shall come to an end. 
ISA.29.20	And all those lying in wait for evil shall be cut off; 
ISA.29.21	those who mislead a person into sin with a word 
ISA.29.21	and set a trap for the arbitrator
ISA.29.21	and guide away the righteous by emptiness. 
ISA.29.22	Therefore Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, says this to the house of Jacob: 
ISA.29.22	“Jacob will no longer be ashamed, 
ISA.29.22	and his face will no longer grow pale. 
ISA.29.23	For when he sees his children, 
ISA.29.23	the work of my hands, in his midst, 
ISA.29.23	they will treat my name as holy, 
ISA.29.23	and they will treat the holy one of Jacob as holy, 
ISA.29.23	and they will stand in awe of the God of Israel. 
ISA.29.24	And those who err in spirit will acquire
ISA.29.24	and those who grumble will learn instruction. 
ISA.30.1	“Oh rebellious children!” declares
ISA.30.1	“to make a plan, but
ISA.30.1	and pour out a libation, but
ISA.30.1	so as to add
ISA.30.2	Who go to go down to Egypt, 
ISA.30.2	but
ISA.30.2	to take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh 
ISA.30.2	and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt. 
ISA.30.3	And the protection of Pharaoh shall be shame to you, 
ISA.30.3	and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt, humiliation. 
ISA.30.4	For his officials are at Zoan, 
ISA.30.4	and his envoys reach to Hanes. 
ISA.30.5	Everyone will start to stink because of a people that cannot profit them, 
ISA.30.5	not for help and not for profiting, 
ISA.30.5	but for shame and also for disgrace.” 
ISA.30.6	An oracle of the animals of the Negev: 
ISA.30.6	Through a land of trouble and distress, 
ISA.30.6	of lioness and lion, 
ISA.30.6	among
ISA.30.6	they carry their wealth on the backs
ISA.30.6	and their treasures on the humps
ISA.30.6	to a people that cannot profit them. 
ISA.30.7	For
ISA.30.7	therefore I have called this one “Rahab, they are sitting.” 
ISA.30.8	Now go, write it on a tablet with them, 
ISA.30.8	and inscribe it on a scroll, 
ISA.30.8	that
ISA.30.8	forever, forever. 
ISA.30.9	For it is a people of rebellion, deceitful children, 
ISA.30.9	children who are not willing to hear the instruction of Yahweh, 
ISA.30.10	who say to those who do see, “You must not see!” 
ISA.30.10	and to the seers, “You must not see truth for us; 
ISA.30.10	speak smooth things to us, 
ISA.30.10	see illusions, 
ISA.30.11	turn aside from the way, 
ISA.30.11	turn aside from the path, 
ISA.30.11	put an end to the holy one of Israel from our face.” 
ISA.30.12	Therefore the holy one of Israel says this: 
ISA.30.12	“Because you are rejecting this word 
ISA.30.12	and you trust in oppression and cunning
ISA.30.12	and you rely on it, 
ISA.30.13	therefore this iniquity shall come for you like a breach about to fall, 
ISA.30.13	bulging out on a high wall that breaks
ISA.30.14	And he breaks it like a vessel of a potter
ISA.30.14	that is crushed; he has no compassion, 
ISA.30.14	and no potsherd is found among its fragments
ISA.30.14	or to skim
ISA.30.15	For the Lord Yahweh, the holy one of Israel, said this: 
ISA.30.15	“In returning and rest you shall be saved; 
ISA.30.15	your strength shall be in quietness and in trust.” 
ISA.30.15	But
ISA.30.16	and you said, 
ISA.30.16	“No! For we will flee on horses!”
ISA.30.16	And, “We will ride on swift horses!”
ISA.30.17	One thousand because of
ISA.30.17	because
ISA.30.17	until you are left like a flagstaff on top
ISA.30.17	and like a signal on a hill. 
ISA.30.18	Therefore Yahweh waits to be gracious to you, 
ISA.30.18	and therefore he will rise up to show you mercy, 
ISA.30.18	for Yahweh is a God of justice; 
ISA.30.18	blessed are all those who wait for him. 
ISA.30.19	For people will live in Zion; 
ISA.30.19	in Jerusalem, you will surely not weep. 
ISA.30.19	Surely he will be gracious to you; 
ISA.30.19	when he hears the sound of your cry, he will answer you. 
ISA.30.20	And the Lord will give you the bread of distress 
ISA.30.20	and the water of oppression, 
ISA.30.20	but
ISA.30.20	And your eyes shall see
ISA.30.21	And your ears shall hear a word from behind you, saying, 
ISA.30.21	“this is the way; walk in it,” 
ISA.30.21	when you go to your right 
ISA.30.21	and when you go to your left. 
ISA.30.22	And you will defile the plating of your silver idols 
ISA.30.22	and the covering of your gold image. 
ISA.30.22	You will scatter them like contaminated things;
ISA.30.22	you will say to it, “Filth!”
ISA.30.23	And he will give rain for your seed with which you sow the ground, 
ISA.30.23	and grain, the produce of the ground, and it will be rich and fertile.
ISA.30.23	On that day, your cattle will graze in broad pastures;
ISA.30.24	and the oxen and the donkeys that till
ISA.30.24	that has been winnowed with shovel and pitchfork. 
ISA.30.25	And there will be streams on every high mountain and elevated hill, 
ISA.30.25	watercourses of water, on a day of great slaughter, when towers fall. 
ISA.30.26	And the light of the full moon will be like the light of the sun, 
ISA.30.26	and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days, 
ISA.30.26	on the day when Yahweh binds up the breakage of his people, 
ISA.30.26	and he heals the wound of his blow. 
ISA.30.27	Look! The name of Yahweh comes from afar, 
ISA.30.27	burning with his anger and heaviness of cloud. 
ISA.30.27	His lips are full of indignation, 
ISA.30.27	and his tongue is like a devouring fire. 
ISA.30.28	And his breath is like an overflowing river; 
ISA.30.28	it reaches up to the neck 
ISA.30.28	to shake the nations with the sieve of worthlessness; 
ISA.30.28	and a bridle that leads astray is on the jawbones of the peoples. 
ISA.30.29	You shall have a song
ISA.30.29	and a gladness of heart like one who goes with the flute, 
ISA.30.29	to go to the mountain of Yahweh, to the rock of Israel. 
ISA.30.30	And Yahweh will cause the majesty of his voice to be heard, 
ISA.30.30	and he will cause the descent of his arm to be seen, 
ISA.30.30	in furious anger and a flame of devouring fire, 
ISA.30.30	with a cloudburst and a rainstorm and stones
ISA.30.31	Indeed, Assyria will be shattered by the voice of Yahweh; 
ISA.30.31	he strikes with the rod. 
ISA.30.32	And every stroke of the staff of foundation
ISA.30.32	and he will fight against it
ISA.30.33	For Topheth has been prepared from yesterday; 
ISA.30.33	indeed, it is made ready for the king. 
ISA.30.33	He makes its pile of wood deep and wide; 
ISA.30.33	he makes fire and wood abundant.
ISA.30.33	The breath of Yahweh burns in it like a stream of sulfur. 
ISA.31.1	Ah! Those who go down to Egypt for help! 
ISA.31.1	They rely on horses 
ISA.31.1	and trust in chariots because they are many, 
ISA.31.1	and in horsemen because they are very numerous, 
ISA.31.1	and they do not look to the holy one of Israel, 
ISA.31.1	and they do not consult Yahweh. 
ISA.31.2	And indeed, he is wise, and he brings disaster, 
ISA.31.2	and he does not remove his words, 
ISA.31.2	and he will rise against the house of evildoers 
ISA.31.2	and against the help of workers of iniquity. 
ISA.31.3	And the Egyptians are human and not God, 
ISA.31.3	and their horses are flesh and not spirit. 
ISA.31.3	And Yahweh stretches out his hand, 
ISA.31.3	and the helper will stumble, 
ISA.31.3	and the one being helped will fall, 
ISA.31.3	and together all of them will come to an end.
ISA.31.4	For Yahweh said this to me: 
ISA.31.4	“As which a lion growls 
ISA.31.4	and a young lion over its prey 
ISA.31.4	when a full group
ISA.31.4	it is not terrified by their voice, 
ISA.31.4	and to their noise it does not respond, 
ISA.31.4	so Yahweh of hosts will come down to fight upon Mount Zion 
ISA.31.4	and upon its hill. 
ISA.31.5	Like birds flying overhead, so Yahweh of hosts will protect Jerusalem; 
ISA.31.5	he will protect and deliver it; 
ISA.31.5	he will pass over and rescue it. 
ISA.31.6	Turn back to the one against whom the sons of Israel have made deep rebellion. 
ISA.31.7	For on that day, each one will reject his idols of silver 
ISA.31.7	and his idols of gold which your hands have made in sin for you. 
ISA.31.8	And Assyria shall fall by a sword not of a man, 
ISA.31.8	and a sword not of a human shall devour him; 
ISA.31.8	and he shall flee from the sword, 
ISA.31.8	and his young men shall be put to forced labor. 
ISA.31.9	And his rock will pass over because of terror, 
ISA.31.9	and his officers will be terrified because of the flag,” 
ISA.31.9	declares
ISA.31.9	who has a fire in Zion 
ISA.31.9	and has a furnace in Jerusalem. 
ISA.32.1	See, a king will rule according to righteousness, 
ISA.32.1	and princes will rule according to justice. 
ISA.32.2	And each one will be like a hiding place from the wind 
ISA.32.2	and a covering from the rainstorm, 
ISA.32.2	like streams of water in a dry region, 
ISA.32.2	like the shade of a large rock in a weary land. 
ISA.32.3	And the eyes of those who see will not gaze,
ISA.32.3	and the ears of those who hear will listen. 
ISA.32.4	And the minds
ISA.32.4	and the tongues
ISA.32.5	A fool will no longer be called noble, 
ISA.32.5	and a scoundrel will not be said to be eminent. 
ISA.32.6	For a fool speaks folly, 
ISA.32.6	and his mind
ISA.32.6	to behave wickedly,
ISA.32.6	and to speak error concerning Yahweh, 
ISA.32.6	to leave the throat of the hungry empty, 
ISA.32.6	and he deprives the thirsty of drink. 
ISA.32.7	And a scoundrel, his weapons are evil; 
ISA.32.7	he plans evil devices 
ISA.32.7	to ruin the poor with words of deception 
ISA.32.7	even
ISA.32.8	But
ISA.32.8	and he stands upon noble things. 
ISA.32.9	Women who are at ease, rise up; hear my voice! 
ISA.32.9	Carefree daughters, listen to my word! 
ISA.32.10	In a year
ISA.32.10	for the vintage will come to an end; 
ISA.32.10	the harvest will not come. 
ISA.32.11	Tremble, you who are at ease; 
ISA.32.11	tremble, carefree ones; 
ISA.32.11	strip, and strip yourself, 
ISA.32.11	and gird yourself on your loins,
ISA.32.12	mourning over breasts, 
ISA.32.12	over fields of delight, 
ISA.32.12	over the fruitful vine, 
ISA.32.13	over the soil of my people. 
ISA.32.13	It goes up in thorns
ISA.32.13	indeed over all of the houses of joy in the jubilant city. 
ISA.32.14	For the palace will be forsaken, 
ISA.32.14	the crowded city
ISA.32.14	the hill and the watchtower will become
ISA.32.14	the joy of wild asses, a pasture for
ISA.32.15	Until a spirit is poured out on us from on high, 
ISA.32.15	and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, 
ISA.32.15	and the fruitful field is reckoned as the forest. 
ISA.32.16	Then
ISA.32.16	and righteousness will live in the fruitful field. 
ISA.32.17	And the work of righteousness will be peace, 
ISA.32.17	and the work of righteousness, quietness and security forever. 
ISA.32.18	And my people will dwell in a settlement of peace 
ISA.32.18	and in a dwelling place of security 
ISA.32.18	and in undisturbed resting places. 
ISA.32.19	And it hails when the forest comes down,
ISA.32.19	and the city will become low in humiliation. 
ISA.32.20	Happy are you who sow by all waters, 
ISA.32.20	who let the foot of the ox and the donkey go free. 
ISA.33.1	Ah, destroyer, and yourself not destroyed! 
ISA.33.1	And treacherous one, and no one has dealt treacherously with him!
ISA.33.1	When you cease
ISA.33.1	When you stop dealing treacherously, one will deal treacherously with you. 
ISA.33.2	Yahweh, be gracious to us, we wait for you. 
ISA.33.2	Be our
ISA.33.2	indeed our salvation in the time of trouble. 
ISA.33.3	At the sound of tumult, peoples fled; 
ISA.33.3	because of your exaltation, nations scattered. 
ISA.33.4	And your spoil is gathered, 
ISA.33.4	as the gathering of the locust, 
ISA.33.4	as a swarm of locusts storming on it. 
ISA.33.5	Yahweh is exalted, for he dwells on high; 
ISA.33.5	he filled Zion with justice and righteousness, 
ISA.33.6	and he will be the security of your times, 
ISA.33.6	an abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. 
ISA.33.6	The fear of Yahweh is his treasure. 
ISA.33.7	Look! Their heroes cry out in the street; 
ISA.33.7	the messengers of peace weep bitterly. 
ISA.33.8	Highways are deserted; 
ISA.33.8	the traveler on the road ceases. 
ISA.33.8	One breaks a treaty, 
ISA.33.8	he rejects the cities,
ISA.33.8	he does not hold man in high regard. 
ISA.33.9	The land mourns; it languishes. 
ISA.33.9	Lebanon feels abashed; it withers. 
ISA.33.9	Sharon is like the desert, 
ISA.33.9	and Bashan and Carmel are losing their leaves.
ISA.33.10	“Now I will arise,” says Yahweh. 
ISA.33.10	“Now I will lift myself up proudly; 
ISA.33.10	now I will raise myself. 
ISA.33.11	You conceive dry grass, you bring forth stubble; 
ISA.33.11	your breath is a fire; it will consume you. 
ISA.33.12	And the peoples will be burning to lime— 
ISA.33.12	they are burned like thorns that have been cut down in the fire. 
ISA.33.13	You who are far away, hear what I have done; 
ISA.33.13	and you who are near, know my might!” 
ISA.33.14	Sinners are afraid in Zion; 
ISA.33.14	trembling has seized the godless: 
ISA.33.14	“Who of us can live
ISA.33.14	Who of us can live
ISA.33.15	He who walks in righteousness 
ISA.33.15	and speaks uprightness, 
ISA.33.15	who rejects the gain of extortion, 
ISA.33.15	who refuses
ISA.33.15	who stops up his ears
ISA.33.15	and shuts his eyes from seeing evil. 
ISA.33.16	That one will live on the heights; 
ISA.33.16	the fortresses of rocks will be his refuge. 
ISA.33.16	His food will be given; 
ISA.33.16	his waters
ISA.33.17	Your eyes will see the king in his beauty; 
ISA.33.17	they will see a distant land.
ISA.33.18	Your mind
ISA.33.18	“Where is the one who counted? 
ISA.33.18	Where is the one who weighed out? 
ISA.33.18	Where is the one who counted the towers?” 
ISA.33.19	You will not see the insolent people, 
ISA.33.19	the people whose language is too obscure to understand,
ISA.33.19	whose stammering of tongue cannot be understood.
ISA.33.20	Look on Zion, the city of our appointed festivals! 
ISA.33.20	Your eyes will see Jerusalem, 
ISA.33.20	an undisturbed settlement, 
ISA.33.20	a tent that is not moved.
ISA.33.20	No one will ever pull out its tent pegs, 
ISA.33.20	and none of its ropes will be torn in two. 
ISA.33.21	Rather, there Yahweh will be mighty for us, 
ISA.33.21	a place of rivers and broad streams,
ISA.33.21	a galley ship with
ISA.33.21	and a mighty ship cannot pass through it. 
ISA.33.22	For Yahweh is our judge; Yahweh is our lawgiver. 
ISA.33.22	Yahweh is our king; he is the one who will save us. 
ISA.33.23	Your riggings hang slack; 
ISA.33.23	they do not hold the base of their mast firm, 
ISA.33.23	they do not spread out the sail. 
ISA.33.23	Then the prey of spoil in abundance will be divided; 
ISA.33.23	the lame will take plunder. 
ISA.33.24	And no inhabitant will say, “I am sick”; 
ISA.33.24	the people who live in it, their iniquity will be taken away. 
ISA.34.1	Come near, nations, to hear; 
ISA.34.1	and peoples, listen attentively! 
ISA.34.1	Let the earth hear, and that which fills it; 
ISA.34.1	the world and all its offspring. 
ISA.34.2	For the anger of Yahweh is against all the nations, 
ISA.34.2	and his wrath is against all their armies; 
ISA.34.2	he has put them under a ban, 
ISA.34.2	he has given them up for slaughter. 
ISA.34.3	And their slain shall be cast out; 
ISA.34.3	as for
ISA.34.3	And the mountains shall melt with
ISA.34.4	and all the host of heaven shall rot. 
ISA.34.4	And the skies shall roll up like a scroll, 
ISA.34.4	and all their host shall wither 
ISA.34.4	like the withering of a leaf from a vine, 
ISA.34.4	or
ISA.34.5	When my sword is drenched in the heavens, 
ISA.34.5	look! It will descend upon Edom, 
ISA.34.5	and upon the people of my ban, for judgment. 
ISA.34.6	Yahweh has a sword;
ISA.34.6	it is full of blood. 
ISA.34.6	It is covered with
ISA.34.6	with
ISA.34.6	with
ISA.34.6	for Yahweh has a sacrifice
ISA.34.6	and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. 
ISA.34.7	And wild oxen shall go down with them, 
ISA.34.7	and steers with strong bulls. 
ISA.34.7	And their land shall be drenched with
ISA.34.7	and their soil shall be fattened with
ISA.34.8	For Yahweh has a day of vengeance,
ISA.34.8	a year of retribution for the strife of Zion. 
ISA.34.9	And its streams shall be changed to pitch and its soil to sulfur, 
ISA.34.9	and its land shall become like burning pitch. 
ISA.34.10	Night and day it shall not be quenched; 
ISA.34.10	its smoke shall go up forever. 
ISA.34.10	From generation to generation it shall be in ruins; 
ISA.34.10	forever and ever there will be no one who passes through her. 
ISA.34.11	But
ISA.34.11	and the owl and the raven shall live in it. 
ISA.34.11	And he shall stretch the measuring line of confusion out over it, 
ISA.34.11	and the plumb line of emptiness. 
ISA.34.12	Its nobles—but no kingdom is there—shall call, 
ISA.34.12	and all its princes shall be nothing. 
ISA.34.13	And thorns shall go up her citadel fortress, 
ISA.34.13	weeds
ISA.34.13	and it shall be the settlement of jackals, 
ISA.34.13	green grass for the daughters of an ostrich. 
ISA.34.14	And desert creatures shall meet with hyenas, 
ISA.34.14	and a goat-demon shall call to his neighbor; 
ISA.34.14	surely there Lilith
ISA.34.14	and she shall find a resting place for herself. 
ISA.34.15	There the owl shall nest and lay 
ISA.34.15	and hatch and care for her chicks in her shadow; 
ISA.34.15	surely there the birds of prey shall be gathered, 
ISA.34.15	each one with her mate. 
ISA.34.16	Seek from the book of Yahweh and read;
ISA.34.16	none of these shall be missing; 
ISA.34.16	none shall miss her mate. 
ISA.34.16	For my
ISA.34.16	and his spirit is the one that
ISA.34.17	And he is the one that
ISA.34.17	and his hand has apportioned it to them with the measuring line; 
ISA.34.17	they shall take possession of it forever, 
ISA.34.17	they shall live in it from generation to generation.
ISA.35.1	Wilderness and dry land shall be glad,
ISA.35.1	and desert shall rejoice and blossom like the crocus. 
ISA.35.2	It shall blossom abundantly, 
ISA.35.2	and it shall rejoice indeed with rejoicing and exulting. 
ISA.35.2	The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, 
ISA.35.2	the majesty of Carmel and Sharon. 
ISA.35.2	They are the ones who
ISA.35.2	the majesty of our God. 
ISA.35.3	Strengthen the weak hands 
ISA.35.3	and make the staggering knees firm. 
ISA.35.4	Say to those who are hasty of heart, 
ISA.35.4	“Be strong; you must not fear! 
ISA.35.4	Look! your God will come with vengeance, 
ISA.35.4	with divine retribution.
ISA.35.4	He is the one who
ISA.35.5	Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, 
ISA.35.5	and the ears of the deaf shall be opened. 
ISA.35.6	Then the lame shall leap like the deer, 
ISA.35.6	and the tongue of the dumb shall sing for joy, 
ISA.35.6	for waters shall break forth in the wilderness 
ISA.35.6	and streams in the desert. 
ISA.35.7	And the parched ground shall become a pool, 
ISA.35.7	and the thirsty ground springs of water. 
ISA.35.7	Her resting place is in a settlement of jackals; 
ISA.35.7	the grass shall become like reeds
ISA.35.8	And a highway shall be there, and a way, 
ISA.35.8	and it shall be called the way of holiness. 
ISA.35.8	The unclean shall not travel through it, 
ISA.35.8	but
ISA.35.8	and fools shall not wander about. 
ISA.35.9	No lion shall be there, 
ISA.35.9	and no ferocious wild beast shall go up it. 
ISA.35.9	It shall not be found there, 
ISA.35.9	but
ISA.35.10	And the ransomed of Yahweh shall return, 
ISA.35.10	and they shall come to Zion with rejoicing. 
ISA.35.10	And everlasting joy shall be on their head; 
ISA.35.10	joy and gladness shall overtake them, 
ISA.35.10	and sorrow and sighing shall flee. 
ISA.36.1	And this happened: In the fourteenth year
ISA.36.2	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh
ISA.36.3	And Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace,
ISA.36.4	And Rabshakeh said to them, “Now say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: “What is this confidence in which you trust? 
ISA.36.5	I said, ‘Only a word of lips! War has power and a plan!’
ISA.36.6	Look, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt, which if a man leans on it, goes into his hand and bores through it! Such is Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all those who trust in him. 
ISA.36.7	And if you say to me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God,’ was it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed? And he said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall bow down in the presence
ISA.36.8	And now please make a wager with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, that is, if you are able put
ISA.36.9	But how can you drive back one governor among the least of my master’s servants,
ISA.36.10	And now was it without Yahweh that I have come up against this land to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, “Go up against this land and destroy it!” ’ ” 
ISA.36.11	And Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we can understand
ISA.36.12	But
ISA.36.13	Then
ISA.36.14	Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you! 
ISA.36.15	And do not let Hezekiah make you rely on Yahweh, saying, “Surely Yahweh will deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria!” 
ISA.36.16	You must not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: “Make a blessing
ISA.36.17	until I come
ISA.36.18	lest Hezekiah mislead you, saying, ‘Yahweh will save us!’ Did the gods of the nations each save his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? 
ISA.36.19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Indeed, have they delivered Samaria from my hand? 
ISA.36.20	Who are there among all the gods of these countries who have saved their land from my hand, that Yahweh should save Jerusalem from my hand?” ’ ” 
ISA.36.21	But
ISA.36.22	Then
ISA.37.1	And this happened: When King Hezekiah heard, he tore his garments, covered himself with sackcloth, and entered the temple
ISA.37.2	And he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of
ISA.37.3	And they said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah: ‘This day is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace, for children have come to the cervical opening, and there is no strength to give birth. 
ISA.37.4	Maybe Yahweh your God heard the words of Rabshakeh whom the king of Assyria, his master, has sent to taunt the living God, and he will rebuke the words that Yahweh your God hears. And you must lift up a prayer for the benefit of the remnant that is found.’ ” 
ISA.37.5	When
ISA.37.6	Isaiah said to them, “You must say this to your master: ‘Thus says Yahweh: “You must not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. 
ISA.37.7	Look! I am about to put
ISA.37.8	And Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that he had left from Lachish. 
ISA.37.9	Now
ISA.37.9	When
ISA.37.10	“You shall say this to Hezekiah, king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust in him deceive you by saying, “Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” 
ISA.37.11	Look! you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands to destroy them, and you—shall you be delivered? 
ISA.37.12	Did the gods of the nations that my predecessors
ISA.37.13	Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, or
ISA.37.14	And Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers, and he read
ISA.37.15	And Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying, 
ISA.37.16	“Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel who is enthroned on
ISA.37.17	Yahweh, extend your ear and hear! Yahweh, open your eyes and see, and hear all the words of Sennacherib that he has sent to taunt the living God! 
ISA.37.18	Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the lands
ISA.37.19	to set
ISA.37.20	So
ISA.37.21	And Isaiah son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: ‘Because you have prayed to me concerning
ISA.37.22	this is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him: 
ISA.37.22	She shows contempt for you; she derides you, virgin daughter of Zion; 
ISA.37.22	she shakes her head behind you, daughter of Jerusalem. 
ISA.37.23	Whom have you taunted and blasphemed, 
ISA.37.23	and against whom have you raised up your voice and lifted your eyes upward? 
ISA.37.23	To the holy one of Israel! 
ISA.37.24	By the hand of your servants you have taunted the Lord, 
ISA.37.24	and you have said, “With my many chariots,
ISA.37.24	I myself have gone up the height of the mountains, 
ISA.37.24	to the remote areas of Lebanon. 
ISA.37.24	And I cut off its tall cedars,
ISA.37.24	the choicest of its junipers. 
ISA.37.24	And I came to the height of its limit, 
ISA.37.24	the forest of its orchard.
ISA.37.25	I myself dug and drank waters, 
ISA.37.25	and I caused all the streams of Egypt to dry up by the sole of my feet.” 
ISA.37.26	Have you not heard from a long time ago?
ISA.37.26	from days of primeval time, and I formed it. 
ISA.37.26	Now I have brought it about, 
ISA.37.26	and it is for fortified cities to collapse into heaps of destroyed stones. 
ISA.37.27	And their inhabitants are weak;
ISA.37.27	they are dismayed, and they are ashamed; 
ISA.37.27	they have become like plants
ISA.37.27	and like greens of grass, 
ISA.37.27	like grass on
ISA.37.27	and a cultivated field before
ISA.37.28	And I know your sitting down and your going out, 
ISA.37.28	and your coming in, and your raging against
ISA.37.29	Because you were enraged against
ISA.37.29	and your noise
ISA.37.29	I will put my hook in your nose 
ISA.37.29	and my bridle on your lips, 
ISA.37.29	and I will turn you back on the way by which you came. 
ISA.37.30	And this shall be the sign for you: the eating of volunteer plants
ISA.37.31	And the remnant of the house of Judah that remain shall grow
ISA.37.32	For a remnant shall go out from Jerusalem 
ISA.37.32	and survivors
ISA.37.32	The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will do this.’ 
ISA.37.33	Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning
ISA.37.33	‘He shall not come to this city, 
ISA.37.33	and he shall not shoot an arrow there, 
ISA.37.33	and he shall not meet it with a shield, 
ISA.37.33	and he shall not heap a siege ramp up against her. 
ISA.37.34	He shall return by the way that he came, 
ISA.37.34	and he shall not come to this city,’ 
ISA.37.34	declares
ISA.37.35	‘And I will defend this city, to save it for my sake and for the sake of David, my servant.’ ” 
ISA.37.36	And the angel of Yahweh set out and struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. When
ISA.37.37	Then
ISA.37.38	And this happened: he was bowing in worship in the house of Nisroch his god, and Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, struck him with the sword. And they themselves escaped to the land of Ararat, and Esar-haddon his son reigned as king in his place. 
ISA.38.1	In those days, Hezekiah became sick to death, and Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet, came to him and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Order your house, for you are about to die, and you shall not recover.’ ” 
ISA.38.2	Then
ISA.38.3	and he said, “O Yahweh, please remember how
ISA.38.4	Then
ISA.38.5	“Go and say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your ancestor:
ISA.38.6	And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.” ’ 
ISA.38.7	And this is the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken: 
ISA.38.8	Look! I will cause the shadow of the steps, which it had gone down on the steps of Ahaz with the sun, to turn backwards ten steps.” And the sun turned back ten steps on the steps which it had gone down. 
ISA.38.9	A writing of Hezekiah, king of Judah, when he was sick and had recovered from his sickness: 
ISA.38.10	I was the one who said, “I must go in the quiet of my days; 
ISA.38.10	I am summoned through the gates of Sheol for the rest of my years.” 
ISA.38.11	I said, “I shall not see Yah! Yah in the land of the living! 
ISA.38.11	I shall no more look at humankind among the inhabitants of the world. 
ISA.38.12	My dwelling place is pulled up and removed from me like the tent of my shepherd; 
ISA.38.12	I have rolled up my life like a weaver. 
ISA.38.12	He cuts me off from the thrum; 
ISA.38.12	from day to night you bring me to an end. 
ISA.38.13	I lie down
ISA.38.13	like a lion, so he breaks all my bones; 
ISA.38.13	from day to night you bring me to an end. 
ISA.38.14	Like a horse or a crane, so I chirp; 
ISA.38.14	I moan like a dove. 
ISA.38.14	My eyes are weak toward the height. 
ISA.38.14	Lord, I have oppression; lend me support! 
ISA.38.15	What can I say? For
ISA.38.15	and he himself has done it. 
ISA.38.15	I will walk slowly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul. 
ISA.38.16	Lord, they live by them, and the life of my spirit belongs to all among them. 
ISA.38.16	And restore me to health and keep me alive! 
ISA.38.17	Look! Bitterness was bitter to me for peace. 
ISA.38.17	And you were the one who loved
ISA.38.17	for you have cast all my sins behind your back. 
ISA.38.18	For Sheol cannot praise you; death cannot praise you. 
ISA.38.18	Those who go down to the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness. 
ISA.38.19	The living, the living one praises you like me today; 
ISA.38.19	a father will make your faithfulness known to children. 
ISA.38.20	Yahweh, save me, and we will play my music on stringed instruments all the days of our lives at the temple
ISA.38.21	And Isaiah said, “Let them take
ISA.38.22	And Hezekiah said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the temple
ISA.39.1	At that time, Merodach-Baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for
ISA.39.2	And Hezekiah rejoiced over them and showed them his house of aromatic gum, the silver, gold, spices, good oil, all the house of his weapons, and all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing that Hezekiah had not shown them in his house or in all his dominion. 
ISA.39.3	And Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?” And Hezekiah answered,
ISA.39.4	And he
ISA.39.5	And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of Yahweh of hosts: 
ISA.39.6	‘Look! days are coming, and all that is in your house and that which your ancestors
ISA.39.7	‘And some of your sons who go out from you, whom you fathered, shall be taken, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’ ” 
ISA.39.8	And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of Yahweh that you have spoken is good,” for
ISA.40.1	“Comfort; comfort my people,” says your God. 
ISA.40.2	“Speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and call to her, 
ISA.40.2	that her compulsory labor is fulfilled, that her sin is paid for, 
ISA.40.2	that she has received
ISA.40.3	A voice is calling in the wilderness, “Clear the way of Yahweh! 
ISA.40.3	Make a highway smooth in the desert for our God! 
ISA.40.4	Every valley shall be lifted up, 
ISA.40.4	and every mountain and hill shall become low, 
ISA.40.4	And the rough ground shall be like a plain, 
ISA.40.4	and the rugged ground like a valley-plain. 
ISA.40.5	And the glory of Yahweh shall be revealed, 
ISA.40.5	and all humankind
ISA.40.5	for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.” 
ISA.40.6	A voice is saying, “Call!” 
ISA.40.6	And he said, “What shall I call?” 
ISA.40.6	All humankind
ISA.40.6	and all his loyalty is like the flowers of the field. 
ISA.40.7	Grass withers; the flower withers 
ISA.40.7	when the breath of Yahweh blows on it. 
ISA.40.7	Surely the people are grass. 
ISA.40.8	Grass withers; the flower withers, 
ISA.40.8	but
ISA.40.9	Get yourself
ISA.40.9	Lift up your voice with strength, Jerusalem, bringer of good news! 
ISA.40.9	Lift it up; you must not fear! 
ISA.40.9	Say to the cities of Judah, “Here is your God!” 
ISA.40.10	Look! The Lord Yahweh comes with strength,
ISA.40.10	and his arm rules for him. 
ISA.40.10	Look! His reward is with him, 
ISA.40.10	and his recompense in his presence.
ISA.40.11	He will feed his flock like a shepherd; 
ISA.40.11	he will gather the lambs in his arm, 
ISA.40.11	and he will carry them in his bosom; 
ISA.40.11	he will lead those who nurse. 
ISA.40.12	Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand 
ISA.40.12	and marked off the heavens with a span, 
ISA.40.12	comprehended the dust of the earth in a third of a measure 
ISA.40.12	and weighed out the mountains in the scales,
ISA.40.13	Who has measured up the spirit of Yahweh 
ISA.40.13	or informed him as his counselor
ISA.40.14	With whom has he consulted, that
ISA.40.14	and taught him the path of justice, 
ISA.40.14	and taught him knowledge, 
ISA.40.14	and made the way of understanding known to him? 
ISA.40.15	Look! The nations are like a drop from a bucket, 
ISA.40.15	and they are counted like dust of the balances! 
ISA.40.15	Look! He weighs the islands like a thin covering. 
ISA.40.16	And Lebanon is not enough to light a fire, 
ISA.40.16	and its animals
ISA.40.17	All the nations are like nothing before him; 
ISA.40.17	they are counted by him as
ISA.40.18	And to whom will you liken God? 
ISA.40.18	And to what likeness will you compare him? 
ISA.40.19	A craftsman pours out the idol, 
ISA.40.19	and a goldsmith
ISA.40.19	and he smelts chains of silver. 
ISA.40.20	The one who is too impoverished for a gift chooses wood that will not rot; 
ISA.40.20	he seeks a skillful artisan for himself to set up an image that will not be knocked over. 
ISA.40.21	Have you not known? 
ISA.40.21	Have you not heard? 
ISA.40.21	Has it not been told to you from the beginning?
ISA.40.21	Have you not understood from the foundation of the earth? 
ISA.40.22	He is the one who sits above the circle of the earth, 
ISA.40.22	and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; 
ISA.40.22	the one who stretches out the heavens like a veil 
ISA.40.22	and spreads them out like a tent to live in, 
ISA.40.23	the one who brings
ISA.40.23	he makes rulers of the earth like nothing. 
ISA.40.24	Indeed, hardly are they planted; indeed, hardly are they sown; 
ISA.40.24	indeed, hardly has their shoot taken root in the earth 
ISA.40.24	when
ISA.40.24	and the tempest carries them like stubble. 
ISA.40.25	“And to whom you will compare me, and am I equal?” says the holy one. 
ISA.40.26	Lift your eyes up on high, and see! Who created these? 
ISA.40.26	The one who brings out their host by number. 
ISA.40.26	He calls all them by name. 
ISA.40.26	Because he is great of power 
ISA.40.26	and mighty of power, no man is missing. 
ISA.40.27	Why
ISA.40.27	and you speak, Israel, 
ISA.40.27	“My way is hidden from Yahweh, 
ISA.40.27	and my judgment is passed over by my God?” 
ISA.40.28	Have you not known, 
ISA.40.28	or have you not heard? 
ISA.40.28	Yahweh is the God of eternity, 
ISA.40.28	the creator of the ends of the earth! 
ISA.40.28	He is not faint, and he does not grow weary! 
ISA.40.28	There is no searching his understanding. 
ISA.40.29	He gives power to the weary, 
ISA.40.29	and he increases power for the powerless.
ISA.40.30	Even
ISA.40.30	and the young will stumble, exhausted. 
ISA.40.31	But
ISA.40.31	They shall go up with wings
ISA.40.31	they shall run and not grow weary; 
ISA.40.31	they shall walk and not be faint. 
ISA.41.1	Listen to me in silence, coastlands, 
ISA.41.1	and let nations renew their strength. 
ISA.41.1	Let them approach, then let them speak; 
ISA.41.1	let us draw near together for judgment. 
ISA.41.2	Who has roused salvation from the east, 
ISA.41.2	summoned
ISA.41.2	gives nations in his presence,
ISA.41.2	and subjugates kings? 
ISA.41.2	He makes
ISA.41.2	like scattered stubble with his bow. 
ISA.41.3	He pursues them and passes on in peace; 
ISA.41.3	he does not enter the path with his feet. 
ISA.41.4	Who has accomplished and done this, 
ISA.41.4	calling the generations from the beginning?
ISA.41.4	I, Yahweh, am first; 
ISA.41.4	and I am the one with the last. 
ISA.41.5	The coastlands have seen and are afraid; 
ISA.41.5	the ends of the earth tremble. 
ISA.41.5	They have drawn near, 
ISA.41.5	and they have come. 
ISA.41.6	Each one helps
ISA.41.6	he says to his brother, “Take courage!” 
ISA.41.7	And the artisan encourages the goldsmith,
ISA.41.7	the one who makes smooth with the hammer encourages the one who strikes the anvil, 
ISA.41.7	saying of the soldering, “It is good!” 
ISA.41.7	And they strengthen it with nails so it cannot be knocked over. 
ISA.41.8	But
ISA.41.8	you, the offspring
ISA.41.9	you whom I grasped from the ends of the earth 
ISA.41.9	and called from its remotest parts 
ISA.41.9	and told, “You are my servant; 
ISA.41.9	I have chosen you and I have not rejected you.” 
ISA.41.10	You must not fear, for I am with you; 
ISA.41.10	you must not be afraid, for I am your God. 
ISA.41.10	I will strengthen you, indeed I will help you, 
ISA.41.10	indeed I will take hold of you with the right hand of my salvation. 
ISA.41.11	Look! All those who are angry with you shall be ashamed and humiliated; 
ISA.41.11	your opponents
ISA.41.12	You shall seek them, 
ISA.41.12	but
ISA.41.12	your opponents
ISA.41.12	and the men of your war like nothing. 
ISA.41.13	For I, Yahweh your God, am grasping your right hand; 
ISA.41.13	it is I who say
ISA.41.13	“You must not fear; 
ISA.41.13	I myself, I will help you. 
ISA.41.14	You must not fear, O worm of Jacob; 
ISA.41.14	people of Israel, I myself, I will help you,” 
ISA.41.14	declares
ISA.41.14	“and your redeemer is the holy one of Israel. 
ISA.41.15	Look! I will make you into a new sharp threshing sledge, 
ISA.41.15	with
ISA.41.15	You shall thresh and crush the mountains, 
ISA.41.15	and you shall make the hills like chaff. 
ISA.41.16	You shall winnow them and the wind shall carry them, 
ISA.41.16	and the tempest shall scatter them. 
ISA.41.16	And you yourself shall rejoice in Yahweh; 
ISA.41.16	you shall boast in the holy one of Israel. 
ISA.41.17	The poor and the needy are seeking water and there is none; 
ISA.41.17	their tongue is dried up with thirst. 
ISA.41.17	I, Yahweh, will answer them; 
ISA.41.17	I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them. 
ISA.41.18	I will open rivers on the barren heights 
ISA.41.18	and fountains in the midst of the valleys. 
ISA.41.18	I will make the wilderness like a pool of water 
ISA.41.18	and the land of dryness like springs of water. 
ISA.41.19	I will put
ISA.41.19	I will set the cypress, elm, and box tree together in the desert 
ISA.41.20	so that they may see and know, 
ISA.41.20	and take to heart and understand together 
ISA.41.20	that the hand of Yahweh has done this, 
ISA.41.20	and the holy one of Israel has created it.” 
ISA.41.21	“Present your legal case,” says Yahweh. 
ISA.41.21	“Bring your evidence,” says the king of Jacob. 
ISA.41.22	Let them bring them, 
ISA.41.22	and let them tell us what will happen. 
ISA.41.22	Tell us what the former things are 
ISA.41.22	so that
ISA.41.22	and know their outcome.
ISA.41.22	Declare to us the things to come; 
ISA.41.23	tell us the things coming hereafter,
ISA.41.23	that
ISA.41.23	Indeed, do good or
ISA.41.23	that
ISA.41.24	Look! you are nothing, 
ISA.41.24	and your work is something worthless; 
ISA.41.24	whoever chooses you is an abomination. 
ISA.41.25	I stirred up one from the north, 
ISA.41.25	and he has come from the rising of the sun. 
ISA.41.25	He shall call on my name, 
ISA.41.25	and he shall come on officials as on mortar, 
ISA.41.25	and as the potter
ISA.41.26	Who declared it from the beginning
ISA.41.26	and beforehand
ISA.41.26	Indeed, there was no one who declared it; 
ISA.41.26	Indeed, there was no one who proclaimed it. 
ISA.41.26	Indeed there was no one who heard your words. 
ISA.41.27	First to Zion, look! Look at them! 
ISA.41.27	And I give a herald
ISA.41.28	But
ISA.41.28	and I look among these and there is no counselor, 
ISA.41.28	that
ISA.41.29	Look! All of them are deception; 
ISA.41.29	their works are nothing; 
ISA.41.29	their images are wind and emptiness. 
ISA.42.1	Look! here is my servant; I hold him, 
ISA.42.1	my chosen one, in whom my soul delights. 
ISA.42.1	I have put
ISA.42.1	he will bring justice forth to the nations. 
ISA.42.2	He will not cry out and lift up 
ISA.42.2	and make his voice heard in the street. 
ISA.42.3	He will not break a broken reed, 
ISA.42.3	and he not will extinguish a dim wick. 
ISA.42.3	He will bring justice forth in
ISA.42.4	He will not grow faint, 
ISA.42.4	and he will not be broken 
ISA.42.4	until he has established justice in the earth. 
ISA.42.4	And the coastlands wait for his teaching. 
ISA.42.5	Thus says the God, Yahweh, 
ISA.42.5	who created the heavens 
ISA.42.5	and stretched them out, 
ISA.42.5	who spread out the earth and its offspring, 
ISA.42.5	who gives breath to the people upon it 
ISA.42.5	and spirit to those who walk in it. 
ISA.42.6	“I am Yahweh; I have called you in righteousness, 
ISA.42.6	and I have grasped your hand and watched over you; 
ISA.42.6	and I have given you as a covenant of the people, 
ISA.42.6	as a light of the nations, 
ISA.42.7	to open the blind eyes, 
ISA.42.7	to bring the prisoner out from the dungeon, 
ISA.42.7	those who sit in darkness from the house of imprisonment. 
ISA.42.8	I am Yahweh; that is my name, 
ISA.42.8	and I do not give my glory to another, 
ISA.42.8	nor
ISA.42.9	Look! the former things have come, 
ISA.42.9	and I declare new things. 
ISA.42.9	I announce
ISA.42.10	Sing a new song to Yahweh; 
ISA.42.10	praise him from the end of the earth, 
ISA.42.10	you
ISA.42.10	the coastlands and their inhabitants. 
ISA.42.11	Let the desert and its towns lift up their voice, 
ISA.42.11	the villages that Kedar inhabits. 
ISA.42.11	Let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy; 
ISA.42.11	let them shout loudly from the top
ISA.42.12	Let them give
ISA.42.12	and declare his praise in the coastlands. 
ISA.42.13	Yahweh goes forth like a mighty warrior; 
ISA.42.13	he stirs up zeal like a man of war. 
ISA.42.13	He raises the war cry, indeed he raises the battle shout; 
ISA.42.13	he prevails against his foes. 
ISA.42.14	I have been silent for a long time; 
ISA.42.14	I have kept silent; 
ISA.42.14	I have restrained myself like one giving birth; 
ISA.42.14	I will moan, pant, and gasp together. 
ISA.42.15	I will cause mountains and hills to dry up, 
ISA.42.15	and I will cause all their herbage to wither; 
ISA.42.15	and I will make rivers like islands, 
ISA.42.15	and I will cause pools to dry up. 
ISA.42.16	And I will lead the blind by a road they do not know; 
ISA.42.16	I will cause them to tread on paths they have not known. 
ISA.42.16	I will make darkness in their presence
ISA.42.16	and rough places into level ground. 
ISA.42.16	These are the things I will do, 
ISA.42.16	and I will not forsake them. 
ISA.42.17	They shall turn back; 
ISA.42.17	they shall be greatly ashamed,
ISA.42.17	those who trust in an image, 
ISA.42.17	who say to a cast image, “You are our gods.” 
ISA.42.18	Deaf people, listen! 
ISA.42.18	And blind people, look to see! 
ISA.42.19	Who is blind but my servant 
ISA.42.19	or
ISA.42.19	Who is blind like the one who is repaid 
ISA.42.19	or
ISA.42.20	You see many things, but
ISA.42.20	His ears are open, but
ISA.42.21	Yahweh was willing for the sake of his righteousness; 
ISA.42.21	he showed his teaching to be great and proved it to be glorious. 
ISA.42.22	But
ISA.42.22	and they are kept hidden in houses of imprisonment. 
ISA.42.22	They have become like plunder, and there is no one who saves; 
ISA.42.22	like booty, and there is no one who says, “Restore!” 
ISA.42.23	Who among you will heed this, 
ISA.42.23	will listen attentively and listen, for the time to come?
ISA.42.24	Who gave Jacob to a plunderer
ISA.42.24	and Israel to those who plunder? 
ISA.42.24	Was it not Yahweh, against whom
ISA.42.24	And they were not willing to walk in his ways, 
ISA.42.24	and they would not obey
ISA.42.25	So
ISA.42.25	and the strength of war. 
ISA.42.25	And it set him afire all around, but
ISA.42.25	and it burned him, but
ISA.43.1	But now thus says Yahweh, 
ISA.43.1	he who created you, Jacob, 
ISA.43.1	and he who formed you, Israel: 
ISA.43.1	“You must not fear, for I have redeemed you. 
ISA.43.1	I have called you by your name; you are mine.
ISA.43.2	When you pass through the waters, I will be with you, 
ISA.43.2	and through the rivers, they shall not flow over you. 
ISA.43.2	When you walk through fire, you shall not be burned, 
ISA.43.2	and the flame shall not scorch
ISA.43.3	For I am Yahweh, your God, 
ISA.43.3	the holy one of Israel, your savior. 
ISA.43.3	I give you Egypt as ransom, 
ISA.43.3	Cush and Seba in place of you. 
ISA.43.4	Because you are precious in my eyes, 
ISA.43.4	you are honored, and I myself love you, 
ISA.43.4	and I give people in place of you, 
ISA.43.4	and nations in place of your life. 
ISA.43.5	You must not fear, 
ISA.43.5	for I am with you. 
ISA.43.5	I will bring your offspring
ISA.43.5	and I will gather you from the west. 
ISA.43.6	I will say to the north, ‘Give!’ 
ISA.43.6	and to the south, ‘You must not withhold!’ 
ISA.43.6	Bring my sons from far away, 
ISA.43.6	and my daughters from the end of the earth— 
ISA.43.7	everyone who is called by my name, 
ISA.43.7	and whom I created for my glory, 
ISA.43.7	whom I formed, 
ISA.43.7	indeed whom I made.” 
ISA.43.8	Bring out the people blind yet
ISA.43.8	and deaf, though
ISA.43.9	Let all the nations gather together, 
ISA.43.9	and let the peoples assemble. 
ISA.43.9	Who among them has declared this, 
ISA.43.9	and declared
ISA.43.9	Let them bring
ISA.43.9	and let them hear and say, “It is true!” 
ISA.43.10	“You are my witnesses,” declares
ISA.43.10	“and my servant whom I have chosen 
ISA.43.10	so that you may know and believe in
ISA.43.10	and understand that I am he. 
ISA.43.10	No god was formed before me
ISA.43.10	and none shall be after me. 
ISA.43.11	I myself am Yahweh, 
ISA.43.11	and there is no savior besides me! 
ISA.43.12	I myself declared and saved, 
ISA.43.12	and I proclaimed.
ISA.43.12	And you are my witnesses,” declares
ISA.43.12	“and I am God. 
ISA.43.13	Indeed, from this day I am the one, 
ISA.43.13	and no one can deliver from my hand. 
ISA.43.13	I perform,
ISA.43.14	Thus says Yahweh, your redeemer, 
ISA.43.14	the holy one of Israel: 
ISA.43.14	“For your sake I will send to Babylon, 
ISA.43.14	and I will cause all of them to fall down as fugitives, 
ISA.43.14	and the Chaldeans,
ISA.43.15	I am Yahweh, your holy one, 
ISA.43.15	the creator of Israel, your king.” 
ISA.43.16	Thus says Yahweh, who makes
ISA.43.16	and a path in the mighty waters, 
ISA.43.17	who brings out chariot and horse, 
ISA.43.17	army and mighty one. 
ISA.43.17	Together they lie down; 
ISA.43.17	they cannot rise. 
ISA.43.17	They are extinguished, 
ISA.43.17	quenched like a wick. 
ISA.43.18	“You must not remember the former things, 
ISA.43.18	and you not must consider the former things. 
ISA.43.19	Look! I am about to do a new thing! Now it sprouts! 
ISA.43.19	Do you not perceive
ISA.43.19	Indeed, I will make
ISA.43.19	rivers in the desert. 
ISA.43.20	The animals of the field will honor me, 
ISA.43.20	jackals and daughters of the ostrich, 
ISA.43.20	for I give water in the wilderness, 
ISA.43.20	rivers in the desert, 
ISA.43.20	to give a drink to my chosen people, 
ISA.43.21	this people whom I formed for myself, 
ISA.43.21	so they might make known
ISA.43.22	But
ISA.43.22	for you have become weary of me, Israel. 
ISA.43.23	You have not brought me your sheep for a burnt offering 
ISA.43.23	nor
ISA.43.23	I have not made you serve with offerings,
ISA.43.23	nor have I made you weary with frankincense. 
ISA.43.24	You have not bought me spice reed with money 
ISA.43.24	or
ISA.43.24	But you have burdened me with your sins; 
ISA.43.24	you have made me weary with your iniquities. 
ISA.43.25	I, I am the one who blots out your transgressions for my sake, 
ISA.43.25	and I will not remember your sins. 
ISA.43.26	Take me to court; let us enter into judgment together. 
ISA.43.26	You, make an account
ISA.43.27	Your first ancestor
ISA.43.27	and your representatives
ISA.43.28	And I profaned the princes of the sanctuary, 
ISA.43.28	and I gave Jacob to destruction, and Israel to reviling. 
ISA.44.1	“But now hear, Jacob my servant, 
ISA.44.1	and Israel, whom I have chosen. 
ISA.44.2	Thus says Yahweh, who made you, 
ISA.44.2	and who formed you in
ISA.44.2	you must not fear, my servant Jacob, 
ISA.44.2	and Jeshurun whom I have chosen. 
ISA.44.3	For I will pour out water on a thirsty land 
ISA.44.3	and streams on dry ground. 
ISA.44.3	I will pour my spirit out on your descendants
ISA.44.3	and my blessing on your offspring. 
ISA.44.4	And they shall sprout among
ISA.44.4	like willows by a watercourse of water. 
ISA.44.5	This one will say, ‘I belong to Yahweh!’ 
ISA.44.5	And that one will be called by the name of Jacob, 
ISA.44.5	and another will write on his hand ‘Yahweh’s’ 
ISA.44.5	and take the name
ISA.44.6	Thus says Yahweh, the king of Israel, 
ISA.44.6	and its redeemer, Yahweh of hosts: 
ISA.44.6	“I am the first, and I am the last, 
ISA.44.6	and there is no god besides me. 
ISA.44.7	And who is like me? Let him proclaim
ISA.44.7	And let him declare it and set it in order for me 
ISA.44.7	since I established an eternal people
ISA.44.7	and let them tell them the things that are coming. 
ISA.44.8	You must not tremble,
ISA.44.8	and you must not be paralyzed with fear. 
ISA.44.8	Have I not made you hear from of old
ISA.44.8	and declared it, and you are my witnesses? 
ISA.44.8	Is there a god besides me? 
ISA.44.8	And there is no rock! I know none!” 
ISA.44.9	All those who form an idol are nothing, 
ISA.44.9	and their delightful things do not profit. 
ISA.44.9	And their witnesses do not see or know, 
ISA.44.9	so they will be ashamed. 
ISA.44.10	Who would form a god 
ISA.44.10	and cast an image of which he cannot profit? 
ISA.44.11	Look! all his companions shall be ashamed, 
ISA.44.11	and the artisans are human! 
ISA.44.11	Let all of them assemble; 
ISA.44.11	let them stand up. 
ISA.44.11	They shall tremble;
ISA.44.11	they shall be ashamed together. 
ISA.44.12	The ironsmith
ISA.44.12	and forms it with hammers. 
ISA.44.12	And he makes it with his strong arm;
ISA.44.12	indeed, he becomes hungry, and he lacks
ISA.44.12	he does not drink water, and he is faint. 
ISA.44.13	The woodworker
ISA.44.13	he makes an outline of it with a marker. 
ISA.44.13	He makes it with a knife 
ISA.44.13	and makes an outline of it with a compass. 
ISA.44.13	He makes it like the image of a man, 
ISA.44.13	like the beauty of a human, to dwell in a temple.
ISA.44.14	Cutting down cedars for himself, 
ISA.44.14	he chooses
ISA.44.14	and he lets it grow strong for him among the trees of the forest. 
ISA.44.14	He plants a cedar, and the rain makes it grow. 
ISA.44.15	And it becomes fuel for a human,
ISA.44.15	and he takes some of it and grows warm; 
ISA.44.15	also, he kindles a fire and bakes bread. 
ISA.44.15	Also, he makes a god and bows in worship; 
ISA.44.15	he makes himself an image and bows down to it! 
ISA.44.16	He burns half of it in the fire; 
ISA.44.16	he eats meat over half of it; 
ISA.44.16	he roasts a roast and is satisfied. 
ISA.44.16	Also he grows warm and says, “Ah! 
ISA.44.16	I am warm! I see the fire!” 
ISA.44.17	And he makes the remainder of it into a god! 
ISA.44.17	He bows down to his idol, 
ISA.44.17	and he bows in worship and prays to him, 
ISA.44.17	and he says, “Save me, for you are my god!” 
ISA.44.18	They do not know, 
ISA.44.18	and they do not understand, 
ISA.44.18	for their eyes are besmeared so that they cannot see,
ISA.44.18	their minds
ISA.44.19	And no one takes it to heart,
ISA.44.19	and no understanding to say, “I burned half of it in the fire 
ISA.44.19	and also I baked bread on its coals; 
ISA.44.19	I roasted meat, and I have eaten. 
ISA.44.19	And I shall make the rest of it into an abomination! 
ISA.44.19	I shall bow down to a block of wood!” 
ISA.44.20	He feeds on ashes; a deceived mind
ISA.44.20	And he cannot save himself,
ISA.44.20	“Is this not an illusion in my right hand?” 
ISA.44.21	Remember these things, Jacob, 
ISA.44.21	and Israel, for you are my servant: 
ISA.44.21	I formed you; you are my servant; 
ISA.44.21	Israel, you will not be forgotten by me! 
ISA.44.22	I have wiped your transgressions out like a cloud 
ISA.44.22	and your sins like mist. 
ISA.44.22	Return to me, for I have redeemed you! 
ISA.44.23	Sing for joy, heavens, for Yahweh has done it! 
ISA.44.23	Shout, depths of the earth! 
ISA.44.23	Break forth, mountains, in rejoicing, 
ISA.44.23	forest and every tree in it, 
ISA.44.23	for Yahweh has redeemed Jacob, 
ISA.44.23	and he will show his glory in Israel! 
ISA.44.24	Thus says Yahweh, your redeemer, 
ISA.44.24	and he who formed you in
ISA.44.24	“I am Yahweh, who made everything, 
ISA.44.24	who stretched out the heavens alone, 
ISA.44.24	who spread out the earth—who was with me?— 
ISA.44.25	who frustrates
ISA.44.25	and makes a fool of diviners, 
ISA.44.25	who drives the wise men back 
ISA.44.25	and makes their knowledge foolish, 
ISA.44.26	who keeps
ISA.44.26	and carries out the plan of his messengers, 
ISA.44.26	who says of Jerusalem, ‘It shall be inhabited,’ 
ISA.44.26	and of the cities of Judah, ‘They shall be rebuilt, 
ISA.44.26	and I will restore its ruins’; 
ISA.44.27	who says to the deep, ‘Dry up! 
ISA.44.27	And I will cause your rivers to dry up’; 
ISA.44.28	who says of Cyrus, ‘My shepherd,’ 
ISA.44.28	and he shall carry out all my wishes
ISA.44.28	and saying of Jerusalem, ‘It shall be rebuilt,’ 
ISA.44.28	and the temple, ‘It shall be founded.’ ” 
ISA.45.1	 Thus says Yahweh to his anointed one, 
ISA.45.1	to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped 
ISA.45.1	to subjugate nations before him, 
ISA.45.1	and I uncover
ISA.45.1	to open doors before him, 
ISA.45.1	and the gates shall not be shut: 
ISA.45.2	“I myself will go before you, 
ISA.45.2	and I will level the mountains.
ISA.45.2	I will break the doors of bronze 
ISA.45.2	and cut throughthe bars of iron. 
ISA.45.3	And I will give you the treasures of darkness 
ISA.45.3	and treasures of secret places 
ISA.45.3	so that you may know that I am Yahweh, 
ISA.45.3	the one who calls you by your name, the God of Israel, 
ISA.45.4	for the sake of my servant Jacob, 
ISA.45.4	and Israel my chosen one. 
ISA.45.4	And I call you by your name; 
ISA.45.4	I give you a name of honor, though
ISA.45.5	I am Yahweh, and there is none besides me; 
ISA.45.5	besides me there is no god. 
ISA.45.5	I gird you though
ISA.45.6	so that they may know from the rising of the sun 
ISA.45.6	and from the west that there is none besides me; 
ISA.45.6	I am Yahweh and there is none besides me. 
ISA.45.7	I form light and I create darkness; 
ISA.45.7	I make peace and I create evil; 
ISA.45.7	I am Yahweh; I do all these things. 
ISA.45.8	Trickle, O heavens, from above, 
ISA.45.8	and let clouds trickle with righteousness; 
ISA.45.8	let the earth open so that
ISA.45.8	and let it cause righteousness to sprout along with it.
ISA.45.8	I myself, Yahweh, have created it. 
ISA.45.9	Woe to the one who strives with his maker,
ISA.45.9	a potsherd among
ISA.45.9	Does the clay say to the one who fashions it, 
ISA.45.9	‘What are you making?’ 
ISA.45.9	and ‘Your work has no hands’? 
ISA.45.10	Woe to the one who says to a father, ‘What you are begetting?’ 
ISA.45.10	or
ISA.45.11	Thus says Yahweh, the holy one of Israel, 
ISA.45.11	and its maker:
ISA.45.11	“Ask me of the things to come about
ISA.45.11	and you command me about the work of my hands. 
ISA.45.12	I myself made the earth, 
ISA.45.12	and I created humankind upon it. 
ISA.45.12	I, my hands, stretched out the heavens, 
ISA.45.12	and I commanded all their host. 
ISA.45.13	I myself have stirred him up in righteousness, 
ISA.45.13	and I will make all his paths smooth. 
ISA.45.13	He himself shall build my city, 
ISA.45.13	and he shall set my exiles free, 
ISA.45.13	not for price or a gift,” says Yahweh of hosts. 
ISA.45.14	Thus says Yahweh: 
ISA.45.14	“The acquisition of Egypt 
ISA.45.14	and the merchandise of Cush 
ISA.45.14	and the Sabeans, tall men, 
ISA.45.14	shall pass over to you; 
ISA.45.14	they shall be yours, 
ISA.45.14	and they shall walk behind you. 
ISA.45.14	They shall pass over in chains, 
ISA.45.14	and they shall bow down to you; 
ISA.45.14	they will pray to you: 
ISA.45.14	‘Surely God is with you, and there is no other. 
ISA.45.14	Besides him there is no God.’ ” 
ISA.45.15	Surely you are a God who keeps yourself hidden, 
ISA.45.15	God of Israel, the savior. 
ISA.45.16	All of them are ashamed and indeed humiliated; 
ISA.45.16	the craftsmen of idols go together in insult. 
ISA.45.17	Israel is saved by Yahweh with everlasting salvation; 
ISA.45.17	you shall not be ashamed, 
ISA.45.17	and you shall not be humiliated to all eternity.
ISA.45.18	For thus says Yahweh, who created
ISA.45.18	he is God, who formed
ISA.45.18	and who made
ISA.45.18	He himself established it; 
ISA.45.18	he did not create it as emptiness— 
ISA.45.18	he formed it for inhabiting. 
ISA.45.18	“I am Yahweh and there is none besides me. 
ISA.45.19	I have spoken not in secrecy, in a place, a land, of darkness, 
ISA.45.19	I have not said to the descendants of Jacob, ‘Seek me in vain!’
ISA.45.19	I, Yahweh, am speaking righteousness, 
ISA.45.19	declaring uprightness. 
ISA.45.20	Assemble and come; 
ISA.45.20	draw near together, survivors of the nations! 
ISA.45.20	They do not know, those who carry their wooden idols
ISA.45.20	and pray to a god who cannot save. 
ISA.45.21	Declare and present your case, 
ISA.45.21	also let them consult together! 
ISA.45.21	Who made this known
ISA.45.21	declared it from of old?
ISA.45.21	Was it not I, Yahweh? 
ISA.45.21	And there is no other god besides me, 
ISA.45.21	a righteous God besides me, 
ISA.45.21	and no savior besides me. 
ISA.45.22	Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth, 
ISA.45.22	for I am God and there is none besides me. 
ISA.45.23	I have sworn by myself; 
ISA.45.23	a word that
ISA.45.23	‘Every knee shall kneel down to me; 
ISA.45.23	every tongue shall swear.’ 
ISA.45.24	‘Only in Yahweh,’ one shall say to me, ‘are righteousness and strength.’ 
ISA.45.24	He shall come to him, and all those who were angry with him shall be ashamed. 
ISA.45.25	In Yahweh all the offspring of Israel shall be in the right, 
ISA.45.25	and they shall boast.” 
ISA.46.1	Bel bows down; 
ISA.46.1	Nebo is stooping. 
ISA.46.1	Their idols are on
ISA.46.1	your cargo
ISA.46.2	They stoop; 
ISA.46.2	they bow down together. 
ISA.46.2	They are not able to save the burden, 
ISA.46.2	but
ISA.46.3	“Listen to me, house of Jacob, 
ISA.46.3	and all the remnant of the house of Israel 
ISA.46.3	who have been carried from the belly, 
ISA.46.3	who have been carried from the womb: 
ISA.46.4	Even
ISA.46.4	even
ISA.46.4	I myself have made you, 
ISA.46.4	and I myself will carry you, 
ISA.46.4	and I myself will support you, 
ISA.46.4	and I will save you. 
ISA.46.5	To whom will you liken me, 
ISA.46.5	and count as equal, 
ISA.46.5	and compare with me, 
ISA.46.5	as though
ISA.46.6	Those who lavish gold from the purse 
ISA.46.6	and weigh out silver in the balance scales; 
ISA.46.6	hire a goldsmith
ISA.46.6	and he makes him a god; 
ISA.46.6	they bow down, 
ISA.46.6	indeed they bow in worship. 
ISA.46.7	They carry it on their shoulder; 
ISA.46.7	they support it and they set it in its place, 
ISA.46.7	and it stands in position. 
ISA.46.7	It cannot be removed from its place; 
ISA.46.7	even when he cries out to it, it does not answer. 
ISA.46.7	It does not save him from his trouble. 
ISA.46.8	Remember this and pluck up courage! 
ISA.46.8	Call to mind,
ISA.46.9	Remember the former things from a long time ago,
ISA.46.9	for I am God and there is none besides me, 
ISA.46.9	God and there is none like me, 
ISA.46.10	who from the beginning declares the end, 
ISA.46.10	and from before, things that have not been done, 
ISA.46.10	who says, ‘My plan shall stand,’ 
ISA.46.10	and, ‘I will accomplish
ISA.46.11	who calls a bird of prey from the east, 
ISA.46.11	the man of his
ISA.46.11	Indeed I have spoken; indeed I will bring it to being. 
ISA.46.11	I have formed it; indeed I will do it. 
ISA.46.12	Listen to me, strong of heart, 
ISA.46.12	far from righteousness! 
ISA.46.13	I bring my righteousness near; it is not far. 
ISA.46.13	And my salvation will not delay; 
ISA.46.13	and I will put
ISA.46.13	for Israel my glory.” 
ISA.47.1	Come down and sit on the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon! 
ISA.47.1	Sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of Chaldea! 
ISA.47.1	For they shall no longer call
ISA.47.2	Take the pair of mill stones and grind flour! 
ISA.47.2	Uncover your veil, 
ISA.47.2	strip off your skirt, 
ISA.47.2	uncover your thigh, 
ISA.47.2	pass through the rivers! 
ISA.47.3	Your nakedness shall be exposed; 
ISA.47.3	indeed, your shame shall become visible. 
ISA.47.3	I will take vengeance 
ISA.47.3	and I will not spare
ISA.47.4	Our redeemer, Yahweh of hosts is his name, the holy one of Israel. 
ISA.47.5	Sit silently and go into the darkness, daughter of Chaldea, 
ISA.47.5	for they shall no longer call
ISA.47.6	I was angry with my people; 
ISA.47.6	I profaned my inheritance, 
ISA.47.6	and I gave them into your hand. 
ISA.47.6	You did not give
ISA.47.6	on the aged you made your yoke very heavy. 
ISA.47.7	And you said, “I shall be an eternal mistress forever!” 
ISA.47.7	You did not set these things upon your heart; 
ISA.47.7	you did not remember its end. 
ISA.47.8	Therefore now hear this, luxuriant one who sits
ISA.47.8	who says
ISA.47.8	I shall not sit as a widow, 
ISA.47.8	and I shall not know the loss of children.” 
ISA.47.9	And these two shall come to you in a moment, in one day: 
ISA.47.9	the loss of children and widowhood shall come on you completely,
ISA.47.9	in spite of your many sorceries, 
ISA.47.9	in spite of the power of your great enchantments. 
ISA.47.10	And you felt secure in your wickedness; 
ISA.47.10	you said, “No one
ISA.47.10	Your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, 
ISA.47.10	and you said in your heart, “I am, and besides me there is no one.” 
ISA.47.11	And evil shall come upon you, you will not know; 
ISA.47.11	it will be on the lookout for her. 
ISA.47.11	And disaster shall fall upon you; you will not be able to avert
ISA.47.11	And ruin shall come on you suddenly; you do not know. 
ISA.47.12	Stand, now, in your enchantments, 
ISA.47.12	and in your many sorceries with which you have labored from your youth. 
ISA.47.12	Perhaps you may be able to benefit; 
ISA.47.12	perhaps you may scare away.
ISA.47.13	You struggle with your many consultations;
ISA.47.13	let them stand, now, and save you— 
ISA.47.13	those who see the stars, divide the celestial sphere,
ISA.47.13	who inform by new moons— 
ISA.47.13	from those things that are coming upon you. 
ISA.47.14	Look! They are like stubble; 
ISA.47.14	the fire burns them completely. 
ISA.47.14	They cannot deliver themselves
ISA.47.14	there is no coal for warming oneself,
ISA.47.14	no fire before which to sit. 
ISA.47.15	So are to you those with whom you have labored, 
ISA.47.15	your traders from your youth. 
ISA.47.15	They wander, each to his side; 
ISA.47.15	there is no one who can save you. 
ISA.48.1	Hear this, house of Jacob, 
ISA.48.1	who are called by the name of Israel 
ISA.48.1	and came out from the waters of Judah, 
ISA.48.1	who swear by the name of Yahweh, 
ISA.48.1	and invoke
ISA.48.1	but not in truth 
ISA.48.1	and not in righteousness. 
ISA.48.2	For they call themselves after the holy city,
ISA.48.2	and they lean on the God of Israel— 
ISA.48.2	Yahweh of hosts is his name. 
ISA.48.3	“I declared the former things from of old,
ISA.48.3	and they went out from my mouth. 
ISA.48.3	And I announced
ISA.48.3	I acted,
ISA.48.4	because I know
ISA.48.4	and your neck an iron sinew, 
ISA.48.4	and your forehead bronze. 
ISA.48.5	And I declared them to you from of old; 
ISA.48.5	I announced
ISA.48.5	so that you would not say, ‘My idol did them, 
ISA.48.5	and my image and my cast image commanded them.’ 
ISA.48.6	You have heard; see it all. 
ISA.48.6	And will you not declare it? 
ISA.48.6	I announce
ISA.48.6	and hidden things that
ISA.48.7	Now they are created, and not from of old,
ISA.48.7	and before today, and you have not heard them 
ISA.48.7	so that you could not say, “Look! I knew them.” 
ISA.48.8	Neither have you heard, nor have you known, 
ISA.48.8	nor from of old
ISA.48.8	For I knew you would deal treacherously, very treacherously, 
ISA.48.8	and you are called a rebel from the womb. 
ISA.48.9	For the sake of my name I refrain from
ISA.48.9	and for my praise I restrain it for you 
ISA.48.9	so as not to cut you off. 
ISA.48.10	Look! I have refined you, but
ISA.48.10	I have chosen you in the furnace of misery. 
ISA.48.11	For my own sake, for my own sake I do it; 
ISA.48.11	for why should it
ISA.48.11	And I will not give my glory to another.” 
ISA.48.12	“Listen to me, Jacob, 
ISA.48.12	and Israel, whom I called:
ISA.48.12	I am he. I am the first; 
ISA.48.12	also I am the last. 
ISA.48.13	Indeed, my hand founded the earth, 
ISA.48.13	and my right hand spread out the heavens; 
ISA.48.13	when I summon
ISA.48.14	Assemble, all of you, and hear! 
ISA.48.14	Who among them declared these things? 
ISA.48.14	Yahweh loves him; 
ISA.48.14	he shall perform
ISA.48.14	and his arm against the Chaldeans.
ISA.48.15	I, I myself, I have spoken! 
ISA.48.15	Indeed, I have called him. 
ISA.48.15	I have brought him, 
ISA.48.15	and he will be successful in his way. 
ISA.48.16	Draw near to me; hear this! I have not spoken in secrecy from the beginning;
ISA.48.16	from the time it came to be,
ISA.48.16	And now the Lord Yahweh has sent me and his Spirit.” 
ISA.48.17	Thus says Yahweh, your redeemer, the holy one of Israel: 
ISA.48.17	“I am Yahweh your God, who teaches
ISA.48.17	leads you in the way you should go. 
ISA.48.18	O that you had listened attentively to my commandments! 
ISA.48.18	Then
ISA.48.18	and your righteousness like the waves of the sea. 
ISA.48.19	And your offspring would have been like the sand, 
ISA.48.19	and the descendants of your body
ISA.48.19	It would not be cut off, 
ISA.48.19	and its name would not be destroyed from my presence.” 
ISA.48.20	Go out from Babylon! 
ISA.48.20	Flee from Chaldea! 
ISA.48.20	Proclaim
ISA.48.20	Send it forth
ISA.48.20	say, “Yahweh has redeemed his servant Jacob!” 
ISA.48.21	And when he led them through the deserts, they were not thirsty; 
ISA.48.21	he made water flow from the rock for them, 
ISA.48.21	and he split the rock, 
ISA.48.21	and the water gushed out. 
ISA.48.22	“There is no peace,” says Yahweh, “for the wicked.” 
ISA.49.1	Listen to me, coastlands, 
ISA.49.1	and listen attentively, peoples from far away! 
ISA.49.1	Yahweh called me from the womb; 
ISA.49.1	from the body
ISA.49.2	And he made
ISA.49.2	he hid me in the shadow of his hand, 
ISA.49.2	and he made
ISA.49.2	he hid me in his quiver. 
ISA.49.3	And he said to me, “You are my servant, 
ISA.49.3	Israel, in whom I will show my glory.” 
ISA.49.4	But
ISA.49.4	I have used up my strength for nothing and vanity! 
ISA.49.4	Nevertheless, my justice is with Yahweh, 
ISA.49.4	and my reward is with my God.” 
ISA.49.5	And now Yahweh says, 
ISA.49.5	who formed me from the womb as a servant for him, 
ISA.49.5	to bring Jacob back to him, 
ISA.49.5	and that Israel might not
ISA.49.5	for
ISA.49.5	and my God has become my strength. 
ISA.49.6	And he says, “It is trivial for you to be
ISA.49.6	to raise up the tribes of Jacob 
ISA.49.6	and to bring back the preserved of Israel. 
ISA.49.6	I will give you as a light to the nations, 
ISA.49.6	to be my salvation to the end of the earth.” 
ISA.49.7	Thus says Yahweh, the redeemer of Israel, his holy one, 
ISA.49.7	to the one who despises
ISA.49.7	to the one who abhors the nation, 
ISA.49.7	to the slave of rulers: 
ISA.49.7	“Kings shall see and stand up; 
ISA.49.7	princes, and they shall bow down, 
ISA.49.7	for the sake of Yahweh, who is faithful, 
ISA.49.7	the holy one of Israel, and he has chosen you.” 
ISA.49.8	Thus says Yahweh: 
ISA.49.8	“I have answered you in a time of favor, 
ISA.49.8	and helped you on a day of salvation, 
ISA.49.8	and watched over you, 
ISA.49.8	and given you as a covenant of the people, 
ISA.49.8	to raise up the land, 
ISA.49.8	to give the desolate hereditary property as an inheritance, 
ISA.49.9	saying to the prisoners,
ISA.49.9	to those who are in darkness, “Show yourselves!” 
ISA.49.9	they shall feed along
ISA.49.9	and their pasturage shall be on all the barren heights. 
ISA.49.10	They shall not be hungry or thirsty, 
ISA.49.10	and heat and sun shall not strike them, 
ISA.49.10	for he who takes pity on them will lead them, 
ISA.49.10	and he will guide them to springs of water. 
ISA.49.11	And I will make
ISA.49.11	and my highways shall lead up.
ISA.49.12	Look! These shall come from afar, 
ISA.49.12	And look! These from the north and from the west 
ISA.49.12	and these from the land of Sinim.” 
ISA.49.13	Sing for joy, heavens, and rejoice, earth! 
ISA.49.13	Mountains must break forth in rejoicing! 
ISA.49.13	For Yahweh has comforted his people, 
ISA.49.13	and he will take pity on his afflicted ones. 
ISA.49.14	But
ISA.49.14	and the Lord has forgotten me!” 
ISA.49.15	Can a woman forget her suckling, 
ISA.49.15	refrain from having compassion on the child of her womb? 
ISA.49.15	Indeed, these may forget, 
ISA.49.15	but
ISA.49.16	Look, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands; 
ISA.49.16	your walls are continually before me. 
ISA.49.17	Your children hasten; 
ISA.49.17	your destroyers and those who laid you waste depart
ISA.49.18	Lift your eyes up all around and see; 
ISA.49.18	all of them gather; they come to you. 
ISA.49.18	As surely as I live,
ISA.49.18	declares
ISA.49.18	surely you shall put on all of them like an ornament, 
ISA.49.18	and you shall bind them on like a bride. 
ISA.49.19	Surely your sites of ruins and desolate places and land of ruins,
ISA.49.19	surely now you will be too cramped for your
ISA.49.19	and those who engulfed you will be far away. 
ISA.49.20	Yet the children born when you were bereaved
ISA.49.20	“The place is too cramped for me; 
ISA.49.20	make room
ISA.49.21	Then
ISA.49.21	“Who has borne me these?” 
ISA.49.21	And, “I was bereaved and barren, 
ISA.49.21	exiled and thrust away; 
ISA.49.21	so
ISA.49.21	Look at me! I was left alone; 
ISA.49.21	where have these come from?”
ISA.49.22	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
ISA.49.22	“Look! I will lift my hand up to the nations, 
ISA.49.22	and I will raise my signal to the peoples, 
ISA.49.22	and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, 
ISA.49.22	and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.
ISA.49.23	And kings shall be your guardians,
ISA.49.23	and their queens your nurses. 
ISA.49.23	They shall bow down, faces
ISA.49.23	and they will lick up the dust of your feet. 
ISA.49.23	Then
ISA.49.23	those who await me shall not be ashamed. 
ISA.49.24	Can war-booty be taken from the mighty? 
ISA.49.24	or can a captive of a righteous
ISA.49.25	But thus says Yahweh: 
ISA.49.25	“Indeed a captive of the mighty shall be taken, 
ISA.49.25	and the war-booty of the tyrant shall be rescued, 
ISA.49.25	for
ISA.49.25	and I myself will save your children. 
ISA.49.26	And I will feed your oppressors their own flesh, 
ISA.49.26	and they shall be drunk with their blood as with wine. 
ISA.49.26	Then
ISA.49.26	your savior and redeemer, the strong one of Jacob.” 
ISA.50.1	 Thus says Yahweh: 
ISA.50.1	“Where is this divorce document of your mother’s divorce, with which I dismissed her? 
ISA.50.1	or to whom of my creditors did I sell you? 
ISA.50.1	Look! you were sold because of your sin, 
ISA.50.1	and your mother was dismissed because of your transgressions. 
ISA.50.2	Why was there no man when I came, 
ISA.50.2	no one who answered when I called? 
ISA.50.2	Do I lack the strength to save?
ISA.50.2	Or is there no power in me to deliver? 
ISA.50.2	Look! by my rebuke I dry up the sea; 
ISA.50.2	I make
ISA.50.2	their fish stink because there is no water, 
ISA.50.2	and they
ISA.50.3	I clothe the heavens with darkness, 
ISA.50.3	and I make
ISA.50.4	The Lord Yahweh has given me the tongue of a pupil, 
ISA.50.4	to know how to help the weary with a word. 
ISA.50.4	He awakens morning by morning,
ISA.50.4	awakens an ear for me to listen as do the pupils. 
ISA.50.5	The Lord Yahweh has opened an ear for me, 
ISA.50.5	and I, I was not rebellious. 
ISA.50.5	I did not turn backwards; 
ISA.50.6	I gave my back to those who struck me, 
ISA.50.6	and my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard;
ISA.50.6	I did not hide my face from insults and spittle. 
ISA.50.7	And the Lord Yahweh helps me, 
ISA.50.7	therefore I have not been put to shame; 
ISA.50.7	therefore I have set my face like flint. 
ISA.50.7	And I know that I shall not be ashamed; 
ISA.50.8	he who obtains rights for me is near. 
ISA.50.8	Who will contend with me? Let us stand together. 
ISA.50.8	Who is the master of my judgment? Let him approach me. 
ISA.50.9	Look! The Lord Yahweh helps me. 
ISA.50.9	Who is the one who will declare me guilty? 
ISA.50.9	Look! All of them will be worn out like a garment; 
ISA.50.9	the moth will eat them. 
ISA.50.10	Who among you is in fear of Yahweh, 
ISA.50.10	obeys
ISA.50.10	Who walks in darkness 
ISA.50.10	and has no light, 
ISA.50.10	trusts in the name of Yahweh 
ISA.50.10	and depends on his God? 
ISA.50.11	Look! All of you are kindlers of fire, 
ISA.50.11	who gird yourselves with flaming arrows. 
ISA.50.11	Walk in the light of your fire, 
ISA.50.11	and among the flaming arrows you have kindled! 
ISA.50.11	You shall have this from my hand: 
ISA.50.11	you shall lie down in
ISA.51.1	“Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, 
ISA.51.1	who seek Yahweh. 
ISA.51.1	Look to the rock from which you were hewn, 
ISA.51.1	and to the excavation of the pit from which you were quarried. 
ISA.51.2	Look to Abraham your father, 
ISA.51.2	and to Sarah; she brought you forth. 
ISA.51.2	For I called him alone,
ISA.51.2	but
ISA.51.3	For Yahweh will comfort Zion; 
ISA.51.3	he will comfort all its sites of ruins. 
ISA.51.3	And he will make
ISA.51.3	and its desert like the garden of Yahweh. 
ISA.51.3	Joy and gladness will be found in it, 
ISA.51.3	thanksgiving and the sound
ISA.51.4	“Listen attentively to me, my people, 
ISA.51.4	and my nation, listen to me! 
ISA.51.4	For a teaching will go out from me, 
ISA.51.4	and I will cause my justice to rest for a light to the peoples. 
ISA.51.5	My righteousness is near; my salvation has gone out, 
ISA.51.5	and my arms will judge the peoples. 
ISA.51.5	The coastlands wait for me, 
ISA.51.5	and for my arm they wait. 
ISA.51.6	Lift up your eyes to the heavens 
ISA.51.6	and look to the earth beneath, 
ISA.51.6	for the heavens will be torn to pieces like smoke, 
ISA.51.6	and the earth will be worn out like a garment, 
ISA.51.6	and those who inhabit her will die like gnats. 
ISA.51.6	But
ISA.51.6	and my righteousness will not be broken to pieces. 
ISA.51.7	Listen to me, you who know righteousness, 
ISA.51.7	people who have my teaching in their heart; 
ISA.51.7	you must not fear the reproach of men, 
ISA.51.7	or be terrified because of their abuse. 
ISA.51.8	For a moth will eat them like garments; 
ISA.51.8	a moth will devour
ISA.51.8	but
ISA.51.8	and my salvation for generation after generation.
ISA.51.9	Awake! Awake; put on strength, O arm of Yahweh! 
ISA.51.9	Awake as in days of long ago, 
ISA.51.9	the generations of a long time back! 
ISA.51.9	Are you not the one who cut Rahab in pieces, 
ISA.51.9	the one who pierced the sea-dragon? 
ISA.51.10	Are you not the one who dried up the sea, 
ISA.51.10	the waters of the great deep, 
ISA.51.10	the one who made
ISA.51.10	for those who are redeemed to cross over? 
ISA.51.11	So
ISA.51.11	and they shall come to Zion with singing, 
ISA.51.11	and everlasting joy shall be on their heads.
ISA.51.11	Joy and gladness shall appear;
ISA.51.11	sorrow and sighing shall flee away! 
ISA.51.12	“I, I am he who comforts you; 
ISA.51.12	who are you that
ISA.51.12	And of the son of humankind? He is sacrificed
ISA.51.13	And you have forgotten Yahweh, your maker, 
ISA.51.13	who stretched out the heavens, 
ISA.51.13	and founded the earth. 
ISA.51.13	And you tremble continually, all day, 
ISA.51.13	because of the wrath of the oppressor 
ISA.51.13	when he takes aim
ISA.51.13	But
ISA.51.14	The fettered one shall make haste to be freed. 
ISA.51.14	And he shall not die in
ISA.51.14	and he shall not lack his bread. 
ISA.51.15	For
ISA.51.15	who stirs up
ISA.51.15	so that
ISA.51.15	Yahweh of hosts is his name. 
ISA.51.16	And I have put my words in your mouth, 
ISA.51.16	and I have covered you in the shadow of my hand, 
ISA.51.16	to plant the heavens 
ISA.51.16	and to found the earth, 
ISA.51.16	saying to Zion, ‘You are my people.’ ” 
ISA.51.17	Rouse yourself! Rouse yourself! 
ISA.51.17	Stand up, Jerusalem, who have drunk from the hand of Yahweh the cup of his wrath; 
ISA.51.17	you have drunk the goblet, the cup of staggering; 
ISA.51.17	you have drained it out. 
ISA.51.18	There is no one who guides her among
ISA.51.18	and there is no one who grasps her by the hand among
ISA.51.19	Two things here have happened to you—who will show sympathy
ISA.51.19	devastation and destruction, famine and sword—who will comfort you? 
ISA.51.20	Your children have fainted; 
ISA.51.20	they lie at the head of all the streets, like an antelope in
ISA.51.20	those who are full of the wrath of Yahweh, 
ISA.51.20	the rebuke of your God. 
ISA.51.21	Therefore hear now this afflicted one 
ISA.51.21	and drunken one but
ISA.51.22	Thus says your Lord, Yahweh, 
ISA.51.22	and your God pleads the cause of his people: 
ISA.51.22	“Look! I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering. 
ISA.51.22	You shall not continue
ISA.51.23	And I will put it in the hand of your tormenters, 
ISA.51.23	who have said to you,
ISA.51.23	And you have made
ISA.51.23	and like the street for those who pass
ISA.52.1	Awake! Awake; put on your strength, Zion! 
ISA.52.1	Put on the garments of your beauty, Jerusalem, holy city!
ISA.52.1	For the uncircumcised and the unclean shall not continue to
ISA.52.2	Shake yourself free from the dust! Rise up; sit, Jerusalem! 
ISA.52.2	Free yourselves from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion! 
ISA.52.3	For thus says Yahweh: 
ISA.52.3	“You were sold for nothing, 
ISA.52.3	and you shall be redeemed without money.” 
ISA.52.4	For thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
ISA.52.4	“My people went down to Egypt in the beginning, to dwell as aliens there, and Assyria oppressed him without cause.
ISA.52.5	And now what do I have here?”declares
ISA.52.6	Therefore my people shall know my name, therefore in that day, that I am the one who speaks. Here am I.”
ISA.52.7	How delightful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, 
ISA.52.7	who announces peace, who brings good news, who announces salvation, 
ISA.52.7	who says to Zion, “Your God reigns as a king.” 
ISA.52.8	The voices
ISA.52.8	together they sing for joy; 
ISA.52.8	for they clearly
ISA.52.9	Break forth, 
ISA.52.9	sing for joy together, ruins of Jerusalem, 
ISA.52.9	for Yahweh has comforted his people; 
ISA.52.9	he has redeemed Jerusalem. 
ISA.52.10	Yahweh has bared his holy arm
ISA.52.10	and all the ends
ISA.52.11	Depart, depart, go out from there! You must not touch any unclean thing. 
ISA.52.11	Go out from the midst of it, keep clean, you who carry the vessels of Yahweh. 
ISA.52.12	For you shall not go out in haste, 
ISA.52.12	and you shall not go in flight, 
ISA.52.12	for Yahweh is going before you, 
ISA.52.12	and your rear guard is the God of Israel. 
ISA.52.13	Look, my servant shall achieve success; 
ISA.52.13	he shall be exalted, 
ISA.52.13	and he shall be lifted up, 
ISA.52.13	and he shall be very high. 
ISA.52.14	Just as many were appalled at you— 
ISA.52.14	such was his appearance beyond human disfigurement, 
ISA.52.14	and his form beyond the sons of mankind— 
ISA.52.15	so he shall sprinkle many nations; 
ISA.52.15	because of him, kings shall shut their mouths.
ISA.52.15	For they shall see what has not been told them, 
ISA.52.15	and they shall consider with full attention what they have not heard. 
ISA.53.1	 Who has believed our message, 
ISA.53.1	and to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed? 
ISA.53.2	For
ISA.53.2	and like a root from dry ground. 
ISA.53.2	He had no form and no majesty that
ISA.53.2	and no appearance that
ISA.53.3	He was despised and rejected by men, 
ISA.53.3	a man of suffering, and acquainted with
ISA.53.3	and like one from whom others hide their faces,
ISA.53.3	and we did not hold him in high regard. 
ISA.53.4	However, he was the one who lifted up our sicknesses, 
ISA.53.4	and he carried our pain, 
ISA.53.4	yet
ISA.53.4	struck down by God and afflicted. 
ISA.53.5	But
ISA.53.5	crushed because of our iniquities; 
ISA.53.5	the chastisement for
ISA.53.5	and by his wounds
ISA.53.6	All of us have wandered about like sheep; 
ISA.53.6	we each have turned to his own way; 
ISA.53.6	and Yahweh let fall on him 
ISA.53.6	the iniquity of us all. 
ISA.53.7	He was oppressed and afflicted, 
ISA.53.7	yet
ISA.53.7	he was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, 
ISA.53.7	and like a sheep is dumb before its shearers, 
ISA.53.7	so
ISA.53.8	He was taken by restraint of justice, 
ISA.53.8	and who concerned himself with his generation? 
ISA.53.8	For he was cut off from the land of the living; 
ISA.53.8	he received a blow because of the transgression of my people. 
ISA.53.9	He made
ISA.53.9	and with the rich in his death, 
ISA.53.9	although he had done no violence, 
ISA.53.9	and there was no deceit in his mouth. 
ISA.53.10	Yet
ISA.53.10	he made him sick.
ISA.53.10	If she
ISA.53.10	he will see offspring. 
ISA.53.10	He will prolong days, 
ISA.53.10	and the will of Yahweh will succeed in his hand. 
ISA.53.11	From the trouble of his life
ISA.53.11	he will be satisfied. 
ISA.53.11	In his knowledge, the righteous one, my servant, shall declare many righteous,
ISA.53.11	and he is the one who will bear their iniquities. 
ISA.53.12	Therefore, I will divide to him a portion among the many,
ISA.53.12	and with the strong ones he will divide bounty, 
ISA.53.12	because
ISA.53.12	and was counted with the transgressors; 
ISA.53.12	and
ISA.53.12	and will intercede for the transgressors. 
ISA.54.1	“Sing for joy, barren woman; who has not borne! 
ISA.54.1	Burst forth into rejoicing and rejoice, she who has not been in labor! 
ISA.54.1	For the children of the desolate woman are more than the children of the married woman,” says Yahweh. 
ISA.54.2	“Enlarge the site of your tent, 
ISA.54.2	and let them stretch out the tent curtains of your dwelling place. 
ISA.54.2	You must not spare; make your tent cords long 
ISA.54.2	and strengthen your pegs, 
ISA.54.3	for you will spread out to the right and to the left. 
ISA.54.3	And your descendants
ISA.54.3	and they will inhabit desolate towns. 
ISA.54.4	You must not fear, for you will not be ashamed, 
ISA.54.4	and you must not be confounded, for you will not feel abashed, 
ISA.54.4	for you will forget the shame of your youth, 
ISA.54.4	and you will no longer remember the disgrace of your widowhood. 
ISA.54.5	For your husband
ISA.54.5	and your redeemer is the holy one of Israel, he is called the God of all of the earth. 
ISA.54.6	For Yahweh has called you like a wife forsaken and hurt of spirit, 
ISA.54.6	like
ISA.54.7	I abandoned you for a short
ISA.54.7	but
ISA.54.8	I hid my face from you for a moment, in the flowing of anger, 
ISA.54.8	but
ISA.54.9	“For this is like the waters of Noah to me, 
ISA.54.9	when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again pass
ISA.54.9	so I swore that I would not be
ISA.54.10	For the mountains may depart, 
ISA.54.10	and the hills may sway, 
ISA.54.10	but
ISA.54.10	and my covenant of peace shall not sway,” 
ISA.54.10	says Yahweh, who has compassion on you, 
ISA.54.11	“O afflicted one, driven away, who is not consoled. 
ISA.54.11	Look! I am about to set your stones in hard mortar, 
ISA.54.11	and I will lay your foundation with sapphires. 
ISA.54.12	And I will make
ISA.54.12	and your gates of stones of beryl, 
ISA.54.12	and all your wall of precious stones. 
ISA.54.13	And all your children shall be pupils of Yahweh, 
ISA.54.13	and the peace of your children shall be great. 
ISA.54.14	In righteousness you shall be established. 
ISA.54.14	Be far from oppression, for you shall not fear, 
ISA.54.14	and from terror, for it shall not come near you. 
ISA.54.15	If indeed one attacks, it is not from me; 
ISA.54.15	whoever attacks you shall fall because of you. 
ISA.54.16	Look! I myself have created the craftsman who blows
ISA.54.16	and who produces
ISA.54.16	also
ISA.54.17	Every weapon formed against you shall not succeed, 
ISA.54.17	and you shall declare guilty every tongue that rises against you for judgment. 
ISA.54.17	This is the inheritance of the servants of Yahweh, 
ISA.54.17	and their legal right
ISA.54.17	declares
ISA.55.1	“Ho! Everyone thirsty, come to the waters! 
ISA.55.1	And whoever has no money, come, buy and eat, 
ISA.55.1	and come, buy without money, 
ISA.55.1	wine and milk without price! 
ISA.55.2	Why do you weigh out money for what is not food, 
ISA.55.2	and your labor for what cannot satisfy?
ISA.55.2	Listen carefully to me, and eat what is good, 
ISA.55.2	and let your soul take pleasure in rich
ISA.55.3	Extend your ear, and come to me! 
ISA.55.3	Listen so that
ISA.55.3	and I will make
ISA.55.3	the enduring proofs of the mercies shown to
ISA.55.4	Look! I made
ISA.55.4	a leader and a commander for the peoples. 
ISA.55.5	Look! You shall call a nation that you do not know, 
ISA.55.5	and a nation that does not know you shall run to you, 
ISA.55.5	because of Yahweh your God, 
ISA.55.5	and the holy one of Israel, for he has glorified you.” 
ISA.55.6	Seek Yahweh while he lets himself be found;
ISA.55.6	call him while he is
ISA.55.7	Let the wicked forsake his way, 
ISA.55.7	and the man of sin his thoughts. 
ISA.55.7	And let him return to Yahweh, that
ISA.55.7	and to our God, for he will forgive manifold.
ISA.55.8	“For my thoughts are not your thoughts, 
ISA.55.8	and your ways are not my ways,” 
ISA.55.8	declares
ISA.55.9	“For as the heavens are higher
ISA.55.9	so my ways are higher
ISA.55.9	and my thoughts than your thoughts. 
ISA.55.10	For just as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, 
ISA.55.10	and they do not return there 
ISA.55.10	except they have watered the earth thoroughly 
ISA.55.10	and cause it to bring forth and sprout, 
ISA.55.10	and give seed to the sower 
ISA.55.10	and bread to the eater, 
ISA.55.11	so shall be my word that goes out from my mouth. 
ISA.55.11	It shall not return to me without success, 
ISA.55.11	but shall accomplish
ISA.55.11	and be successful in the thing for which I sent it. 
ISA.55.12	For you shall go out in joy, 
ISA.55.12	and you shall be led in peace. 
ISA.55.12	The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you, rejoicing 
ISA.55.12	and all the trees of the field shall clap hands.
ISA.55.13	Instead of the thorn bush, the juniper shall go up; 
ISA.55.13	instead of the brier, the myrtle shall go up, 
ISA.55.13	and it shall serve as a memorial to Yahweh, 
ISA.55.13	for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.” 
ISA.56.1	Thus says Yahweh: 
ISA.56.1	“Observe justice 
ISA.56.1	and do righteousness, 
ISA.56.1	for my salvation is close to coming, 
ISA.56.1	and my justice to being revealed. 
ISA.56.2	Happy is the man who does this, 
ISA.56.2	and the son of humankind who keeps hold of it, 
ISA.56.2	who keeps the Sabbath so as not to profane
ISA.56.2	and who keeps his hand from doing any
ISA.56.3	And do not let the foreigner
ISA.56.3	And do not let the eunuch say, “Look! I am a dry tree!” 
ISA.56.4	For thus says Yahweh, “To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, 
ISA.56.4	and choose that in which I delight, 
ISA.56.4	and who keep hold of my covenant. 
ISA.56.5	And I will give them a monument and a name in my house and within my walls, 
ISA.56.5	better than sons and daughters; 
ISA.56.5	I will give him an everlasting name 
ISA.56.5	that shall not be cut off. 
ISA.56.6	And the foreigners
ISA.56.6	and to love the name of Yahweh, to become his servants, 
ISA.56.6	every one who keeps the Sabbath, so as not to profane
ISA.56.6	and those who keep hold of my covenant, 
ISA.56.7	I will bring them to my holy mountain;
ISA.56.7	I will make them merry in my house of prayer. 
ISA.56.7	their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted
ISA.56.7	for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples,” 
ISA.56.8	declares
ISA.56.9	All wild animals in the field, come, 
ISA.56.9	to devour,
ISA.56.10	His watchmen are blind, 
ISA.56.10	none of them know. 
ISA.56.10	They are all dumb dogs; 
ISA.56.10	they are unable to bark, 
ISA.56.10	panting, lying down, 
ISA.56.10	loving to slumber. 
ISA.56.11	And the dogs have a greedy appetite;
ISA.56.11	they are never satisfied.
ISA.56.11	And they are the shepherds! 
ISA.56.11	They do not have
ISA.56.11	They all turn to their own way, 
ISA.56.11	each one for his own gain, every one of them.
ISA.56.12	“Come, let me take wine, 
ISA.56.12	and let us carouse with intoxicating drink, 
ISA.56.12	and tomorrow will be like today, 
ISA.56.12	very great indeed.”
ISA.57.1	The righteous one perishes, and there is no one who takes
ISA.57.1	And men of faithfulness are gathered, while there is no one who understands, 
ISA.57.1	for the righteous is gathered from the presence of wickedness. 
ISA.57.2	he enters into peace; 
ISA.57.2	they will rest on their beds, 
ISA.57.2	walking straight ahead of him. 
ISA.57.3	“But
ISA.57.3	offspring of an adulterer and she who commits fornication. 
ISA.57.4	At whom do you make fun? 
ISA.57.4	At whom do you open
ISA.57.4	Are you not children of transgression, 
ISA.57.4	offspring of deception, 
ISA.57.5	who burn with lust among the oaks, 
ISA.57.5	under every leafy tree, 
ISA.57.5	who slaughter children in the valleys, 
ISA.57.5	under the clefts of the rocks? 
ISA.57.6	Your portion is among the smooth stones of the valley; 
ISA.57.6	they, they are your lot; 
ISA.57.6	indeed, to them you have poured out a drink offering, 
ISA.57.6	you have brought a food offering. 
ISA.57.6	Shall I relent concerning these things? 
ISA.57.7	You have set your bed upon a high and lofty mountain; 
ISA.57.7	indeed, you went up there to slaughter sacrifice. 
ISA.57.8	And you have set your symbol behind the door and the doorpost; 
ISA.57.8	for you depart
ISA.57.8	you make your bed wide, and you make a deal with
ISA.57.8	you have loved their bed; you have seen their genitals.
ISA.57.9	And you climbed down to the king with oil, 
ISA.57.9	and you made your perfumes numerous, 
ISA.57.9	and you sent your envoys far away,
ISA.57.9	and you sent down deep
ISA.57.10	You grow weary by the greatness of your way, 
ISA.57.10	but you did not say, ‘Despairing!’ 
ISA.57.10	You found the renewal
ISA.57.10	therefore you do not grow weak. 
ISA.57.11	And of whom were you afraid and feared, that you deceived 
ISA.57.11	and did not remember me? 
ISA.57.11	Did you not place it on your heart? 
ISA.57.11	Have I not been silent, even from long ago, 
ISA.57.11	and so you do not fear me? 
ISA.57.12	I myself will declare your righteousness and your works, 
ISA.57.12	but
ISA.57.13	When you cry,
ISA.57.13	and the wind will carry all of them away; 
ISA.57.13	a breath will take them away. 
ISA.57.13	But
ISA.57.13	and he shall inherit my holy mountain.”
ISA.57.14	And one shall say, “Build up, build up! Clear the way! 
ISA.57.14	Remove the obstacles
ISA.57.15	For thus says the high and lofty one who resides forever, and whose name is holy: 
ISA.57.15	“I reside in a high and holy place, 
ISA.57.15	and with the contrite
ISA.57.15	to revive the spirit of the humble, 
ISA.57.15	and to revive the heart of the contrite.
ISA.57.16	For I will not attack forever, 
ISA.57.16	and I will not be angry forever, 
ISA.57.16	for the spirit will grow faint before me, 
ISA.57.16	and the breaths that I myself I have made. 
ISA.57.17	I was angry because of his sin of gain, and I struck him; 
ISA.57.17	I hid and I was angry, but
ISA.57.18	I have seen his ways, 
ISA.57.18	but
ISA.57.18	and I will lead him 
ISA.57.18	and give him and his mourners comfort as a recompense, 
ISA.57.19	creating fruit of lips. 
ISA.57.19	Peace, peace to the far and near,” says Yahweh, “and I will heal him. 
ISA.57.20	But
ISA.57.20	and its waters toss up mire and mud. 
ISA.57.21	There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.” 
ISA.58.1	“Call with the throat; you must not keep back! 
ISA.58.1	lift up your voice like a trumpet, 
ISA.58.1	and declare
ISA.58.1	and to the house of Jacob their sins. 
ISA.58.2	Yet
ISA.58.2	and they desire the knowledge of my ways 
ISA.58.2	like a nation that practiced
ISA.58.2	and had not forsaken the judgment of its God; 
ISA.58.2	they ask me for righteous judgments,
ISA.58.2	they desire the closeness of God. 
ISA.58.3	‘Why do we fast, and you do not see it? 
ISA.58.3	We humiliate our soul, and you do not notice it?’ 
ISA.58.3	Look! You find delight on the day of your fast, 
ISA.58.3	and you oppress all your workers! 
ISA.58.4	Look! You fast to quarrel and strife, 
ISA.58.4	and to strike with a wicked fist.
ISA.58.4	You shall not fast as you do today,
ISA.58.4	to make your voice heard
ISA.58.5	Is the fast I choose like this, 
ISA.58.5	a day for humankind to humiliate himself
ISA.58.5	To bow his head like a reed, 
ISA.58.5	and make
ISA.58.5	you call this a fast 
ISA.58.5	and a day of pleasure to Yahweh? 
ISA.58.6	Is this not the fast I choose: to release the bonds of injustice, 
ISA.58.6	to untie the ropes of the yoke, 
ISA.58.6	and to let the oppressed go free, 
ISA.58.6	and tear
ISA.58.7	Is it not to break your bread for the hungry? 
ISA.58.7	You must bring home
ISA.58.7	When you see the naked, you must cover him, 
ISA.58.7	and you must not hide yourself from your relatives.
ISA.58.8	Then your light shall break forth like the dawn, 
ISA.58.8	and your healing shall grow quickly. 
ISA.58.8	And your salvation shall go before you; 
ISA.58.8	the glory of Yahweh will be your rear guard. 
ISA.58.9	Then you shall call, and Yahweh himself will answer. 
ISA.58.9	You shall cry for help, and he will say, ‘Here I am!’ 
ISA.58.9	If you remove from among you the yoke, 
ISA.58.9	the finger-pointing
ISA.58.10	if
ISA.58.10	and you satisfy the appetite of the afflicted, 
ISA.58.10	then
ISA.58.10	and your darkness will be like noon. 
ISA.58.11	And Yahweh will lead you continually, and satisfy your soul in a barren land, 
ISA.58.11	and he will strengthen your bones, 
ISA.58.11	and you shall be like a well-watered garden, 
ISA.58.11	and like a spring of water whose water does not fail. 
ISA.58.12	And they shall rebuild ancient ruins from you; 
ISA.58.12	you shall erect the foundations of many generations,
ISA.58.12	and you shall be called
ISA.58.12	the restorer of paths to live in. 
ISA.58.13	If you hold your foot back from the Sabbath, 
ISA.58.13	from doing your affairs on my holy day,
ISA.58.13	if
ISA.58.13	the holy day of Yahweh honorable, 
ISA.58.13	if
ISA.58.13	than finding your affairs
ISA.58.14	then you shall take your pleasure in
ISA.58.14	and I will make you ride upon the heights of the earth, 
ISA.58.14	and I will feed you the heritage of Jacob your ancestor,
ISA.58.14	for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.” 
ISA.59.1	Look! The hand of Yahweh is not too short to save,
ISA.59.1	and his ear is not too dull to hear.
ISA.59.2	Rather, your iniquities have been barriers
ISA.59.2	and your sins have hidden his face from you, from hearing. 
ISA.59.3	For your hands are defiled with blood, 
ISA.59.3	and your fingers with iniquity. 
ISA.59.3	Your lips have spoken lies, 
ISA.59.3	your tongue speaks wickedness. 
ISA.59.4	There is nobody who pleads with
ISA.59.4	and there is nobody who judges with honesty. 
ISA.59.4	They rely on nothing 
ISA.59.4	and speak vanity. 
ISA.59.4	They conceive trouble 
ISA.59.4	and beget iniquity; 
ISA.59.5	they hatch viper eggs, 
ISA.59.5	and they weave a spider web. 
ISA.59.5	One who eats their eggs dies, 
ISA.59.5	and that which is pressed is hatched as a serpent. 
ISA.59.6	Their webs cannot become clothing, 
ISA.59.6	and they cannot cover themselves with their works. 
ISA.59.6	Their works are works of iniquity, 
ISA.59.6	and deeds
ISA.59.7	Their feet run to evil, 
ISA.59.7	and they hasten to shed innocent blood. 
ISA.59.7	Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; 
ISA.59.7	devastation and destruction are in their highways. 
ISA.59.8	They do not know the way of peace, 
ISA.59.8	and there is no justice in their firm paths. 
ISA.59.8	They have made their paths crooked for themselves; 
ISA.59.8	everyone who walks
ISA.59.9	Therefore justice is far from us, 
ISA.59.9	and righteousness does not reach us. 
ISA.59.9	We wait for light, but
ISA.59.9	for brightness, but we walk in darkness. 
ISA.59.10	We grope like the blind along a wall, 
ISA.59.10	and we grope as without
ISA.59.10	We stumble at noon as in the twilight; 
ISA.59.10	among the strong we are like the dead. 
ISA.59.11	We all groan like bears, 
ISA.59.11	and we coo mutteringly like doves. 
ISA.59.11	We wait for justice, but
ISA.59.11	for salvation, but it is far from us. 
ISA.59.12	For our transgressions are numerous before you, 
ISA.59.12	and our sins testify
ISA.59.12	Indeed, our transgressions are with us, 
ISA.59.12	and we know our iniquities: 
ISA.59.13	transgressing and denying Yahweh, 
ISA.59.13	and turning away from following
ISA.59.13	speaking oppression and falsehood, 
ISA.59.13	conceiving and uttering words of deception from the heart. 
ISA.59.14	And justice is pushed back, 
ISA.59.14	and righteousness stands afar; 
ISA.59.14	for truth stumbles in the public square, 
ISA.59.14	and straightforwardness is unable to enter, 
ISA.59.15	and truth is missing, 
ISA.59.15	and he who turns aside from evil is plundered. 
ISA.59.15	And Yahweh saw, 
ISA.59.15	and it was displeasing in his eyes that there was no justice 
ISA.59.16	And he saw that there was no man, 
ISA.59.16	and he was appalled that there was no one who intercedes, 
ISA.59.16	so
ISA.59.16	and his righteousness was what
ISA.59.17	And he put on righteousness like a breastplate, 
ISA.59.17	and a helmet of salvation on his head, 
ISA.59.17	and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, 
ISA.59.17	and he wrapped himself in zeal as in a robe. 
ISA.59.18	According to deeds, so he will repay; 
ISA.59.18	wrath to his enemies, requital to those who are his enemies.
ISA.59.18	He will repay requital to the coastlands. 
ISA.59.19	So
ISA.59.19	and his glory from the sunrise, 
ISA.59.19	for he will come like a narrow stream; 
ISA.59.19	the wind of Yahweh drives it on. 
ISA.59.20	“And a redeemer will come to Zion, 
ISA.59.20	to those in Jacob who turn away from transgression,” 
ISA.59.20	declares
ISA.59.21	“And as for me, this is my covenant with them, says Yahweh: 
ISA.59.21	my spirit that is upon you, 
ISA.59.21	and my words that I have placed in your mouth 
ISA.59.21	shall not depart from your mouth, 
ISA.59.21	or
ISA.59.21	or
ISA.59.21	says Yahweh, “from now on and forever.” 
ISA.60.1	“Arise, shine! For your light has come, 
ISA.60.1	and the glory of Yahweh has risen on you. 
ISA.60.2	For look! darkness shall cover the earth, 
ISA.60.2	and thick darkness the peoples, 
ISA.60.2	but
ISA.60.2	and his glory will appear over you. 
ISA.60.3	And nations shall come to your light, 
ISA.60.3	and kings to the bright light of your sunrise. 
ISA.60.4	Lift up your eyes all around and see! 
ISA.60.4	All of them gather; they come to you. 
ISA.60.4	Your sons shall come from afar, 
ISA.60.4	and your daughters shall be looked after on the hip. 
ISA.60.5	Then you shall see 
ISA.60.5	and you shall be radiant; 
ISA.60.5	and your heart shall tremble 
ISA.60.5	and open itself wide, 
ISA.60.5	because the abundance of the sea shall fall upon you; 
ISA.60.5	the wealth of the nations shall come to you. 
ISA.60.6	A multitude of camels shall cover you, 
ISA.60.6	the young male camels of Midian and Ephah. 
ISA.60.6	All those from Sheba shall come; 
ISA.60.6	they shall bring gold and frankincense, 
ISA.60.6	and they shall proclaim the praise of Yahweh. 
ISA.60.7	All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you; 
ISA.60.7	the rams of Nebaioth shall serve you. 
ISA.60.7	They shall present a sacrifice for favor on my altar, 
ISA.60.7	and I will glorify my honorable house.
ISA.60.8	Who are these? They fly like a cloud, 
ISA.60.8	and like doves to their coops. 
ISA.60.9	Because the coastlands wait for me, 
ISA.60.9	and the ships of Tarshish are first 
ISA.60.9	to bring your children from afar, 
ISA.60.9	their silver and gold with them, 
ISA.60.9	for the name of Yahweh your God, 
ISA.60.9	and for the holy one of Israel, because he has glorified you. 
ISA.60.10	And foreigners
ISA.60.10	and their kings shall serve you, 
ISA.60.10	for in my anger I struck you, 
ISA.60.10	but
ISA.60.11	And your gates shall continually be open, 
ISA.60.11	day and night they shall not be shut, 
ISA.60.11	to bring you the wealth of nations, 
ISA.60.11	and their kings shall be led. 
ISA.60.12	For the nation and the kingdom that will not serve you shall perish, 
ISA.60.12	and the nations shall be utterly devastated. 
ISA.60.13	The glory of Lebanon shall come to you; 
ISA.60.13	the cypress, the plane, and the pine together, 
ISA.60.13	to glorify the place of my sanctuary, 
ISA.60.13	and I will do honor to the place of my feet. 
ISA.60.14	And the children of those who oppressed you shall come to you bending low, 
ISA.60.14	and all those who treated you disrespectfully shall bow down at the soles of your feet. 
ISA.60.14	And they shall call you the city of Yahweh, 
ISA.60.14	Zion of the holy one of Israel. 
ISA.60.15	Instead of you being forsaken 
ISA.60.15	and hated with no one passing through,
ISA.60.15	I will make
ISA.60.15	a joy of coming generations.
ISA.60.16	And you shall suck the milk of nations, 
ISA.60.16	and suck the breast of kings, 
ISA.60.16	and you shall know that I am Yahweh your Savior, 
ISA.60.16	and your Redeemer, the Strong One of Jacob. 
ISA.60.17	Instead of bronze I will bring gold, 
ISA.60.17	and instead of iron I will bring silver, 
ISA.60.17	and instead of wood, bronze, 
ISA.60.17	and instead of stones, iron. 
ISA.60.17	And I will appoint
ISA.60.17	and righteousness as your ruling body.
ISA.60.18	Violence shall no longer be heard in your land; 
ISA.60.18	devastation or
ISA.60.18	And you shall call your walls Salvation, 
ISA.60.18	and your gates, Praise. 
ISA.60.19	The sun shall no longer be your light by day, 
ISA.60.19	and for bright light the moon shall not give you light, 
ISA.60.19	but
ISA.60.19	and your God your glory. 
ISA.60.20	Your sun shall no longer go down, 
ISA.60.20	and your moon shall not wane,
ISA.60.20	for Yahweh himself will be your everlasting light, 
ISA.60.20	and your days of mourning shall come to an end. 
ISA.60.21	And all your people shall be righteous; 
ISA.60.21	they shall take possession of the land forever, 
ISA.60.21	the shoot of his
ISA.60.21	the work of my hands, to show my glory. 
ISA.60.22	The small one shall become a tribe, 
ISA.60.22	and the smallest one a mighty nation. 
ISA.60.22	I am Yahweh; I will hasten it in its time.” 
ISA.61.1	The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is upon me, 
ISA.61.1	because Yahweh has anointed me, 
ISA.61.1	he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, 
ISA.61.1	to bind up the brokenhearted,
ISA.61.1	to proclaim
ISA.61.1	and liberation to those who are bound, 
ISA.61.2	to proclaim
ISA.61.2	and our God’s day of vengeance, 
ISA.61.2	to comfort all those in mourning, 
ISA.61.3	to give
ISA.61.3	to give them a head wrap instead of ashes, 
ISA.61.3	the oil of joy instead of mourning, 
ISA.61.3	a garment of praise instead of a faint spirit. 
ISA.61.3	And they will be called
ISA.61.3	the planting of Yahweh, to show his glory. 
ISA.61.4	And they shall build the ancient ruins, 
ISA.61.4	they shall erect the former deserted places. 
ISA.61.4	And they shall restore the devastated cities,
ISA.61.4	the deserted places of many generations.
ISA.61.5	And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks,
ISA.61.5	and foreigners
ISA.61.6	But
ISA.61.6	you will be called
ISA.61.6	You shall eat the wealth of the nations, 
ISA.61.6	and you shall boast in their riches. 
ISA.61.7	Instead of your shame, a double portion, 
ISA.61.7	and instead of insult, they will rejoice over their portion. 
ISA.61.7	Therefore they will take a double portion in their land; 
ISA.61.7	they shall possess everlasting joy.
ISA.61.8	For I, Yahweh, love justice, 
ISA.61.8	hate robbery and
ISA.61.8	and I will faithfully
ISA.61.8	and I will make
ISA.61.9	And their descendants
ISA.61.9	and their offspring in the midst of the peoples. 
ISA.61.9	All those who see them shall recognize them, 
ISA.61.9	that they are descendants
ISA.61.10	I will rejoice greatly in Yahweh; 
ISA.61.10	my being shall shout in exultation in my God. 
ISA.61.10	For he has clothed me with garments of salvation, 
ISA.61.10	he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, 
ISA.61.10	as a bridegroom adorns himself with a head wrap like a priest, 
ISA.61.10	and as a bride adorns herself with her jewelry. 
ISA.61.11	For as the earth produces
ISA.61.11	and as a garden makes its plants sprout, 
ISA.61.11	so the Lord Yahweh will make righteousness sprout, 
ISA.61.11	and praise before all the nations. 
ISA.62.1	For the sake of Zion I will not be silent, 
ISA.62.1	and for the sake of Jerusalem I will not maintain a quiet attitude, 
ISA.62.1	until her righteousness goes out like the bright light, 
ISA.62.1	and her salvation burns like a torch. 
ISA.62.2	And the nations shall see your righteousness, 
ISA.62.2	and all the kings your glory, 
ISA.62.2	and you will be called
ISA.62.2	that the mouth of Yahweh will designate. 
ISA.62.3	And you shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh, 
ISA.62.3	and a headband of royalty in the hand of your God. 
ISA.62.4	It shall no longer be said of you, “Forsaken,” 
ISA.62.4	and it shall no longer be said of your land, “Desolation!” 
ISA.62.4	but you will
ISA.62.4	and your land, “Married,” 
ISA.62.4	for Yahweh delights in you, 
ISA.62.4	and your land shall be married. 
ISA.62.5	For as a young man marries a virgin, 
ISA.62.5	so shall your sons marry you, 
ISA.62.5	and as is the joy of the bridegroom over the bride, 
ISA.62.5	so shall your God rejoice over you. 
ISA.62.6	I have appointed watchmen upon your walls, Jerusalem; 
ISA.62.6	all day and all night they shall never be silent. 
ISA.62.6	You who profess Yahweh have no rest. 
ISA.62.7	And you must not give him rest until he establishes, 
ISA.62.7	and until he makes
ISA.62.8	Yahweh has sworn by his right hand, 
ISA.62.8	and by his mighty arm,
ISA.62.8	“Surely I will never again give your grain as food to your enemies,
ISA.62.8	and surely foreigners
ISA.62.9	But those who gather it shall eat it, and they shall praise Yahweh, 
ISA.62.9	and those who gather it shall drink it in my holy courts.
ISA.62.10	Pass through, pass through the gates! 
ISA.62.10	Make the way clear for
ISA.62.10	Pile up, pile up the highway; clear it of stones!
ISA.62.10	Lift up an ensign over the peoples! 
ISA.62.11	Look! Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth: 
ISA.62.11	Say to daughter Zion, “Look, your salvation is coming! 
ISA.62.11	Look, his reward is with him, 
ISA.62.11	and his reward before him. 
ISA.62.12	And they shall call them “The Holy People,
ISA.62.12	and you
ISA.63.1	Who is this, coming from Edom, 
ISA.63.1	from Bozrah in bright red garments? 
ISA.63.1	Who is this honored in his garment, 
ISA.63.1	lying down in his great strength? 
ISA.63.1	“It is I, speaking in justice, 
ISA.63.1	mighty
ISA.63.2	Why are your garments
ISA.63.2	and your garments like he who treads in the winepress? 
ISA.63.3	“I have trodden the winepress alone, 
ISA.63.3	and there was no man from the peoples with me. 
ISA.63.3	And I trod them in my anger, 
ISA.63.3	and I trampled them in my wrath, 
ISA.63.3	and spattered their juice on my garments, 
ISA.63.3	and stained all my clothing, 
ISA.63.4	for the day of vengeance was in my heart, 
ISA.63.4	and the year of my blood-vengeance has come! 
ISA.63.5	And I looked, but
ISA.63.5	and I was appalled, but
ISA.63.5	so
ISA.63.5	and my wrath was what
ISA.63.6	And I trampled peoples in my anger, 
ISA.63.6	and I made them drunk in my wrath, 
ISA.63.6	and I brought their juice down to the earth.” 
ISA.63.7	I will mention the loyal love of Yahweh, the praises of Yahweh, according to all that Yahweh has done for us, 
ISA.63.7	and the greatness of goodness to the house of Israel that he has done to them according to his mercy and the abundance of his loyal love. 
ISA.63.8	And he said, “Surely my people are children; they will not break faith.” And he became a Savior to them. 
ISA.63.9	In all their distress, there was no distress,
ISA.63.9	and the messenger of his presence
ISA.63.9	in his love and compassion he himself redeemed them, 
ISA.63.9	and he lifted them up, 
ISA.63.9	and he supported them all the days of old. 
ISA.63.10	But
ISA.63.10	and they grieved his Holy Spirit,
ISA.63.10	so
ISA.63.10	he himself fought against them. 
ISA.63.11	Then
ISA.63.11	Where is the one who led up them from the sea with the shepherds of his flock? 
ISA.63.11	Where is the one who puts his Holy Spirit
ISA.63.12	who made
ISA.63.12	who divided
ISA.63.12	to make an everlasting name for himself, 
ISA.63.13	who led
ISA.63.13	They did not stumble like a horse in the desert; 
ISA.63.14	like cattle in the valley that goes down, the Spirit of Yahweh gave him rest,
ISA.63.14	so you lead your people to make a magnificent name for yourself. 
ISA.63.15	Look from heaven, 
ISA.63.15	and see from the lofty residence of your holiness and glory. 
ISA.63.15	Where are your zeal and strength? 
ISA.63.15	Your compassion
ISA.63.16	For you are our father, although Abraham does not know us, 
ISA.63.16	and Israel does not acknowledge us. 
ISA.63.16	You, Yahweh are our father, 
ISA.63.16	Our Redeemer from of old is your name. 
ISA.63.17	Why do you make us wander, Yahweh? 
ISA.63.17	You harden our heart from your ways so that we do not fear
ISA.63.17	Turn back for the sake of your servants, 
ISA.63.17	the tribes of your inheritance. 
ISA.63.18	Your holy people
ISA.63.18	our adversaries have trampled down your sanctuary. 
ISA.63.19	We have been since antiquity; you did not rule them; 
ISA.63.19	they were not called by your name.
ISA.64.1	the mountains would quake before you, 
ISA.64.2	 as fire kindles brushwood, 
ISA.64.2	the fire causes water to boil, 
ISA.64.2	to make your name known to your adversaries, 
ISA.64.2	that the nations might tremble from your presence.
ISA.64.3	When you did terrible deeds which we did not expect,
ISA.64.3	the mountains quaked because of your presence.
ISA.64.4	And since ancient times they have not heard, 
ISA.64.4	have not listened, 
ISA.64.4	no eye has seen a God except you; 
ISA.64.4	he acts
ISA.64.5	You meet with the one who rejoices, 
ISA.64.5	one who does righteousness. 
ISA.64.5	In your ways they remember you. 
ISA.64.5	Look! You were angry and we sinned against them in ancient times and we were saved. 
ISA.64.6	And we all have become like the unclean, 
ISA.64.6	and all our deeds of justice like a menstrual cloth, 
ISA.64.6	And we all wither like a leaf, 
ISA.64.6	and our iniquities take us away like the wind. 
ISA.64.7	And there is no one who calls on your name, 
ISA.64.7	who pulls himself up to keep hold of you, 
ISA.64.7	for you have hidden your face from us,
ISA.64.7	and melted us into the hand of our iniquity. 
ISA.64.8	Yet now Yahweh, you are our father; 
ISA.64.8	we are the clay and you are our potter,
ISA.64.8	and we all are the work of your hand. 
ISA.64.9	You must not be exceedingly angry, Yahweh, 
ISA.64.9	and you must not remember iniquity forever! 
ISA.64.9	Look! Behold, now! We all are your people! 
ISA.64.10	Your holy cities
ISA.64.10	Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 
ISA.64.11	Our holy and beautiful temple,
ISA.64.11	and all our precious objects have become ruins.
ISA.64.12	Will you control yourself because of these, Yahweh? 
ISA.64.12	Will you be silent? 
ISA.64.12	And will you oppress us exceedingly? 
ISA.65.1	“I let myself be sought by those who did not ask; 
ISA.65.1	I let myself be found by those who did not seek me. 
ISA.65.1	I said, ‘Here I am; here I am!’ to a nation that did not call on my name; 
ISA.65.2	I spread out my hands all day to a stubborn people, 
ISA.65.2	those who walk after their thoughts in the way that is not good, 
ISA.65.3	the people who provoke
ISA.65.3	slaughtering for sacrifices in the garden, 
ISA.65.3	and making smoke offerings on bricks, 
ISA.65.4	who sit
ISA.65.4	and spend the night in secret places,
ISA.65.4	who eat
ISA.65.4	with
ISA.65.5	who say,
ISA.65.5	You must not come near me, for I am too holy for you!” 
ISA.65.5	These are a smoke in my nostrils,
ISA.65.5	a fire burning all day. 
ISA.65.6	Look! It is written before me: I will not be silent, but I will repay; 
ISA.65.6	and I will repay in
ISA.65.7	your iniquities and the iniquities of your ancestors
ISA.65.7	because they made smoke offerings on the mountains 
ISA.65.7	and they taunted me on the hills, 
ISA.65.7	I will measure their punishment from the beginning into the fold of their garment.” 
ISA.65.8	Thus says Yahweh: “Just as the new wine is found in the cluster, and they say ‘You must not destroy it, for there is a blessing in it,’ so I will do for the sake of my servants by
ISA.65.9	And I will bring descendant s
ISA.65.9	and a people
ISA.65.9	and my chosen ones shall inherit it, 
ISA.65.9	and my servants shall settle there. 
ISA.65.10	And Sharon shall become a pasture for
ISA.65.10	and the valley of Achor a resting place for
ISA.65.10	for my people who have sought me. 
ISA.65.11	But
ISA.65.11	forgetting my holy mountain,
ISA.65.11	who set a table for Fortune, 
ISA.65.11	and who pour out
ISA.65.12	and I will remit you to the sword, 
ISA.65.12	and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter, 
ISA.65.12	because I called, but
ISA.65.12	I spoke, but
ISA.65.12	but
ISA.65.12	and you chose that in which I do not delight.” 
ISA.65.13	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
ISA.65.13	“Look! My servants shall eat but
ISA.65.13	Look! My servants shall drink but
ISA.65.13	Look! My servants shall rejoice but
ISA.65.14	Look! My servants shall shout for joy,
ISA.65.15	And you shall leave your name to my chosen ones as a curse, 
ISA.65.15	and the Lord Yahweh will kill you, and he will give
ISA.65.16	Whoever blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of trustworthiness, 
ISA.65.16	and the one who swears an oath in the land shall swear by the God of trustworthiness, 
ISA.65.16	because the former troubles are forgotten, 
ISA.65.16	and they are hidden from my eyes. 
ISA.65.17	For look! I am about to create new heavens and a new earth, 
ISA.65.17	and the former things shall not be remembered, 
ISA.65.17	and they shall not come to mind.
ISA.65.18	But rejoice and shout in exultation forever and ever over what I am about to create! 
ISA.65.18	For look! I am about to create Jerusalem as a source of rejoicing, 
ISA.65.18	and her people as a source of joy. 
ISA.65.19	And I will shout in exultation over Jerusalem, 
ISA.65.19	and I will rejoice over my people, 
ISA.65.19	and the sound of weeping shall no longer be heard in it, 
ISA.65.19	or
ISA.65.20	There will no longer be a nursing infant who lives only a few
ISA.65.20	or
ISA.65.20	for the boy will die a hundred years old,
ISA.65.20	and the one who fails to reach
ISA.65.21	And they shall build houses and inhabit them, 
ISA.65.21	and they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 
ISA.65.22	They shall not build and another inhabit; 
ISA.65.22	they shall not plant and another eat. 
ISA.65.22	For the days of my people shall be like the days of a tree, 
ISA.65.22	and my chosen ones shall enjoy the work of their hands. 
ISA.65.23	They shall not labor for nothing, 
ISA.65.23	and they shall not give birth to horror, 
ISA.65.23	for they shall be offspring blessed by
ISA.65.23	and their descendants with them. 
ISA.65.24	And this will happen: before they call, I myself will answer; 
ISA.65.24	while still they are speaking, I myself will hear. 
ISA.65.25	The wolf and the lamb shall feed like one, 
ISA.65.25	and the lion shall eat straw like the ox, 
ISA.65.25	but
ISA.65.25	They shall do no evil, 
ISA.65.25	and they shall not destroy on all my holy mountain,”
ISA.66.1	Thus says Yahweh: 
ISA.66.1	“Heaven is my throne, 
ISA.66.1	and the earth is the footstool for my feet. 
ISA.66.1	Where is this house that you would build for me? 
ISA.66.1	And where is this resting place for me? 
ISA.66.2	And my hand has made all these things, 
ISA.66.2	and all these came to be,”
ISA.66.2	declares
ISA.66.2	to the humble and the contrite of spirit 
ISA.66.2	and the one frightened at my word. 
ISA.66.3	The one who slaughters a bull strikes a man; 
ISA.66.3	the one who slaughters a lamb for sacrifice breaks the neck of a dog. 
ISA.66.3	The one who offers an offering, the blood of swine; 
ISA.66.3	the one who offers frankincense blesses an idol. 
ISA.66.3	Indeed, they themselves have chosen their ways, 
ISA.66.3	and their soul delights in their abhorrence. 
ISA.66.4	Indeed, I myself I will choose their ill treatment, 
ISA.66.4	and I will bring them objects of their dread, 
ISA.66.4	because I called, and no one answered;
ISA.66.4	I spoke and they did not listen, 
ISA.66.4	but
ISA.66.4	and they chose that in which I do not delight.” 
ISA.66.5	Hear the word of Yahweh, you who are frightened at his word: 
ISA.66.5	Your brothers who hate you, 
ISA.66.5	who exclude you for my name’s sake have said, 
ISA.66.5	“Let Yahweh be honored so that
ISA.66.5	But
ISA.66.6	A voice, an uproar from the city! 
ISA.66.6	A voice from the temple! 
ISA.66.6	The voice of Yahweh paying back
ISA.66.7	Before she was in labor she gave birth; 
ISA.66.7	before labor pains
ISA.66.8	Who has heard anything like this? 
ISA.66.8	Who has seen anything like these things? 
ISA.66.8	Can a land be born in one day? 
ISA.66.8	Or can a nation be born in a moment? 
ISA.66.8	Yet when she was in labor, Zion indeed gave birth to her children. 
ISA.66.9	Shall I myself I break open and not deliver?”
ISA.66.9	“or I who delivers
ISA.66.10	“Rejoice with Jerusalem 
ISA.66.10	and shout in exultation with her, all those who love her! 
ISA.66.10	Rejoice with her in joy, all those who mourn over her, 
ISA.66.11	so that you may suck and be satisfied from her consoling breast,
ISA.66.11	so that you may drink deeply and refresh yourselves from her heavy breast.”
ISA.66.12	For thus says Yahweh: 
ISA.66.12	“Look! I am about to spread prosperity out to her like a river, 
ISA.66.12	and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream, 
ISA.66.12	and you shall suck and be carried on the hip; 
ISA.66.12	and you shall you shall be played with on the knees. 
ISA.66.13	As a man whose mother comforts him, so I myself will comfort you, 
ISA.66.13	and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem. 
ISA.66.14	And you shall see and your heart shall rejoice, 
ISA.66.14	and your bones shall flourish
ISA.66.14	and the hand of Yahweh shall make itself known to
ISA.66.14	and he shall curse his enemies. 
ISA.66.15	For look! Yahweh will come in fire, 
ISA.66.15	and his chariots like the storm wind, 
ISA.66.15	to give back
ISA.66.15	and his rebuke in flames of fire. 
ISA.66.16	For Yahweh enters into judgment on all flesh with fire and his sword, 
ISA.66.16	and those slain by
ISA.66.17	Those who sanctify themselves 
ISA.66.17	and those who cleanse themselves to go into
ISA.66.17	eating the flesh of swine 
ISA.66.17	and detestable things
ISA.66.17	shall come to an end!” declares
ISA.66.18	“And I—their works and thoughts!—am about to come to gather all nations and tongues, 
ISA.66.18	and they shall come and see my glory. 
ISA.66.19	And I will set a sign among them, 
ISA.66.19	and I will send survivors from them to the nations: 
ISA.66.19	Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow; 
ISA.66.19	Tubal and Javan, the faraway coastlands 
ISA.66.19	that have not heard of my fame, 
ISA.66.19	and have not seen my glory. 
ISA.66.19	And they shall declare my glory among the nations, 
ISA.66.20	and bring all your countrymen
ISA.66.21	And indeed, I will take some of them as priests and the Levites,” says Yahweh. 
ISA.66.22	“For just as the new heavens and earth that I am about to make shall stand before me,” declares
ISA.66.23	And this shall happen: From new moon to new moon
ISA.66.24	“And they shall go out and look at the corpses of the people
ISA.66.24	for their worm shall not die, 
ISA.66.24	and their fire shall not be quenched, 
ISA.66.24	and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.” 
JER.1.1	The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, among the priests who were in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin, 
JER.1.2	to whom the word of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, the king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. 
JER.1.3	It came also in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month. 
JER.1.4	And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
JER.1.5	“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, 
JER.1.5	and before you came out from the womb I consecrated you; 
JER.1.5	I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.” 
JER.1.6	Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Look, I do not know how to speak, for I am a youth.”
JER.1.7	But Yahweh said to me, “You must not say, ‘I am a youth,’
JER.1.8	Do not be afraid of them,
JER.1.9	Then Yahweh stretched out his hand and he touched my mouth, and Yahweh said to me, 
JER.1.9	“Look, I have put my words in your mouth. 
JER.1.10	See, I appoint you this day over the nations 
JER.1.10	and over the kingdoms, 
JER.1.10	to pluck up and to pull down, 
JER.1.10	and to destroy and to tear down, 
JER.1.10	to build and to plant.” 
JER.1.11	And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
JER.1.12	Then Yahweh said to me, “You did well to see, for I am watching over my word to perform it.” 
JER.1.13	And the word of Yahweh came to me a second time, saying,
JER.1.14	Then Yahweh said to me, “From the north disaster will be unleashed
JER.1.15	For, look, I am calling to all the clans
JER.1.16	And I will pass
JER.1.17	But you, you must gird your loins, and stand, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be afraid of them,
JER.1.18	Now look, I have made you today
JER.1.19	And they will fight against you but they will not prevail against you, for I am with you,” declares
JER.2.1	And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
JER.2.2	“Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying,
JER.2.2	“I remember concerning you the loyal love of your childhood,
JER.2.2	the love of your betrothal-time, 
JER.2.2	your going
JER.2.2	in the land not sown. 
JER.2.3	Israel was holy to Yahweh, 
JER.2.3	the first fruit of his produce. 
JER.2.3	All those who ate it were held guilty; 
JER.2.3	disaster came to them,” declares
JER.2.4	Hear the word of Yahweh, O house of Jacob, and all the clans
JER.2.5	Thus says Yahweh: 
JER.2.5	“What injustice did your ancestors
JER.2.5	that they were far from me, 
JER.2.5	and they went after the vanity, 
JER.2.5	and they became vain? 
JER.2.6	And they did not say, 
JER.2.6	‘Where is Yahweh, 
JER.2.6	the one who brought us up from the land of Egypt, 
JER.2.6	the one who led us in the desert,
JER.2.6	in a land of desert plains and gorges,
JER.2.6	in a land of dryness and deep darkness, 
JER.2.6	in a land that no one passes through,
JER.2.6	and no human lives there?’ 
JER.2.7	And I brought you to the land of the orchard, 
JER.2.7	to eat its fruit, and its good things.
JER.2.7	But you entered and defiled my land, 
JER.2.7	and my inheritance you made a detestable thing.
JER.2.8	The priests did not say, ‘Where is Yahweh?’ 
JER.2.8	and those who handle the law did not know me, 
JER.2.8	and the shepherds have rebelled against me,
JER.2.8	and the prophets prophesied by Baal, 
JER.2.8	and they went after things which do not profit. 
JER.2.9	Therefore
JER.2.9	“and with your children
JER.2.10	For go over to the coasts of Cyprus and look, 
JER.2.10	and send to Kedar and consider very closely, 
JER.2.10	and see if there has been a thing like this: 
JER.2.11	Has a nation exchanged gods? And they are not gods! 
JER.2.11	But my people have exchanged their glory for that which does not profit. 
JER.2.12	Be appalled, O heavens, at this, and shudder; 
JER.2.12	be utterly desolate,” declares
JER.2.13	“For my people have committed two evils: 
JER.2.13	they have forsaken me, the source
JER.2.13	to hew out for themselves cisterns, cracked cisterns that can hold no water. 
JER.2.14	Is Israel a slave? Or a slave born in a house?
JER.2.14	Why has he become plunder? 
JER.2.15	The young lions have roared against him, 
JER.2.15	they have raised
JER.2.15	And they have made his land as horror; 
JER.2.15	his cities are destroyed, without
JER.2.16	Moreover, people of Memphis and Tahpanhes 
JER.2.16	will shave
JER.2.17	Did you not do this to yourself, 
JER.2.17	by forsaking Yahweh, your God, 
JER.2.17	at the time of your leading in the way? 
JER.2.18	And now why do you go
JER.2.18	to drink the waters of the Shihor? 
JER.2.18	And why do you go
JER.2.18	to drink the waters of the Euphrates?
JER.2.19	Your wickedness will chastise you, 
JER.2.19	and your apostasies will reprove you. 
JER.2.19	Therefore know and see that it is evil and bitter, 
JER.2.19	your forsaking of Yahweh, your God, 
JER.2.19	and fear of me is not in you,” 
JER.2.19	declares
JER.2.20	“For from long ago you have broken your yoke, 
JER.2.20	you tore to pieces your bonds. 
JER.2.20	And you said, ‘I will not serve!’ 
JER.2.20	But on every high hill and under every leafy tree 
JER.2.20	you were lying down as a prostitute. 
JER.2.21	Yet I planted you as a choice vine, 
JER.2.21	all of it a seed of trustworthiness. 
JER.2.21	How then have you altered before me 
JER.2.21	into something that is degenerate, the foreign vine? 
JER.2.22	For if you wash with natron, 
JER.2.22	and you use much soap,
JER.2.22	your guilt is sticking as a stain before
JER.2.22	declares
JER.2.23	“How can you say, ‘I have not defiled myself, 
JER.2.23	I have not gone after the Baals?’ 
JER.2.23	Look at your way in the valley, 
JER.2.23	know what you have done. 
JER.2.23	You are a young she-camel, 
JER.2.23	interweaving her ways. 
JER.2.24	A wild ass accustomed to the desert,
JER.2.24	in the desire of her soul. 
JER.2.24	She gasps for wind in her rutting time. 
JER.2.24	Who can quell
JER.2.24	All those who seek her will not grow weary, 
JER.2.24	in her month they will find her. 
JER.2.25	Restrain your foot from being barefoot, 
JER.2.25	and your throat from thirst. 
JER.2.25	But you said, ‘It is hopeless. 
JER.2.25	No! For I have loved strangers, 
JER.2.25	and after them I will go.’
JER.2.26	As the shame of a thief when he is caught in the act, 
JER.2.26	so the house of Israel will be ashamed. 
JER.2.26	They, their kings, their officials, 
JER.2.26	and their priests, and their prophets. 
JER.2.27	Those who say to the tree, ‘You are my father,’ 
JER.2.27	and to the stone, ‘You gave birth to me.’ 
JER.2.27	For they have turned their backs
JER.2.27	But in the time of their trouble they say, ‘Arise and save us.’ 
JER.2.28	But where are your gods that you made for yourself? 
JER.2.28	Let them arise if they can save you in the time of your trouble. 
JER.2.28	For according to the number of your towns 
JER.2.28	are your gods, O Judah. 
JER.2.29	Why do you complain to me? 
JER.2.29	All of you have rebelled against me,”
JER.2.30	“For in vain
JER.2.30	They accepted no discipline. 
JER.2.30	Your sword devoured your prophets, 
JER.2.30	like a ravening
JER.2.31	O generation, you see the word of Yahweh. 
JER.2.31	Have I been a desert
JER.2.31	Why do my people say, ‘We roam about freely, 
JER.2.31	we will not come again to you’? 
JER.2.32	Can a young woman forget her ornaments?
JER.2.32	Yet my people have forgotten me days without number. 
JER.2.33	How well you do on your way to seek love! 
JER.2.33	Therefore
JER.2.34	Also on your skirts is found 
JER.2.34	the blood of the life of the innocent, the poor. 
JER.2.34	You did not find them in the act of breaking into a house. 
JER.2.34	But in spite of all these things, 
JER.2.35	yet you say, ‘But I am innocent, 
JER.2.35	surely his anger has turned away from me.’ 
JER.2.35	Look, I am entering into judgment with you 
JER.2.35	because of your saying, ‘I have not sinned.’ 
JER.2.36	How you go about so much changing your way! 
JER.2.36	Also by Egypt you will be put to shame, 
JER.2.36	just as you were put to shame by Assyria. 
JER.2.37	Also from there you will come out 
JER.2.37	with your hands on your head, 
JER.2.37	for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust,
JER.2.37	and you will not prosper through them. 
JER.3.1	 A saying:
JER.3.1	and she goes from him and she becomes another man’s wife,
JER.3.1	will he return to her again?’ 
JER.3.1	Will not that land be greatly defiled? 
JER.3.1	And you have prostituted yourself with many lovers, 
JER.3.1	would you now return to me?” declares
JER.3.2	“Lift up your eyes at the barren heights, 
JER.3.2	and see where you have not been ravished. 
JER.3.2	Beside the roads you sat for them like an Arab in the desert,
JER.3.2	and you have defiled the land 
JER.3.2	with your fornication 
JER.3.2	and with your wickedness. 
JER.3.3	Therefore rain showers have been withheld, 
JER.3.3	and the spring rain has not come. 
JER.3.3	Yet you have
JER.3.3	you refuse to be ashamed. 
JER.3.4	Have you not just now called to me, 
JER.3.4	‘My father, you are the close friend of my youth? 
JER.3.5	Will he be angry forever?
JER.3.5	Will he maintain it always’?
JER.3.5	Look, you have spoken, 
JER.3.5	but you have done all the evil that you could.”
JER.3.6	Then Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah, the king, “Have you seen what apostate
JER.3.7	And I thought, ‘After her doing all these things to me she will return,’ but she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
JER.3.8	And I saw that for this very reason, that
JER.3.9	And it was because of the frivolity of her fornication that she defiled the land and committed adultery with the stone and with the tree. 
JER.3.10	Yet even in all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, but only
JER.3.11	Then Yahweh said to me, “Apostate
JER.3.12	Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, 
JER.3.12	‘Return, apostate
JER.3.12	‘I will not cause my anger
JER.3.12	For I am loyal,’ declares
JER.3.12	‘I will not be angry forever.
JER.3.13	Only acknowledge your guilt, 
JER.3.13	that against Yahweh your God you have rebelled, 
JER.3.13	and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every leafy tree, 
JER.3.13	and you have not obeyed my voice,’ declares
JER.3.14	“Return, apostate
JER.3.15	Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart and they will feed you knowledge and insight. 
JER.3.16	And it will be when you have multiplied and become fruitful in the land in those days,” declares
JER.3.17	At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘The Throne of Yahweh,’ and all the nations will be gathered to it, to the name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem, and they will no longer go after the stubbornness of their evil heart. 
JER.3.18	In those days the house of Judah will walk along with the house of Israel and they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave as an inheritance to your ancestors.
JER.3.19	Then I thought, ‘How I would set you among the children, 
JER.3.19	and I would give you a land of desire, 
JER.3.19	an inheritance of the glory of the hosts of nations.’ 
JER.3.19	And I thought, ‘You would call me, “My father,” 
JER.3.19	and you would not turn back from behind
JER.3.20	However, as a wife departs treacherously from her lover, 
JER.3.20	so you have dealt treacherously with me, 
JER.3.20	O house of Israel,” declares
JER.3.21	“A voice is heard on the barren heights, 
JER.3.21	the weeping of the pleas for mercy of the children of Israel, 
JER.3.21	because they have perverted their way, 
JER.3.21	they have forgotten Yahweh their God. 
JER.3.22	Return, O apostate
JER.3.22	I will heal your backsliding. 
JER.3.22	‘Look, we come to you, 
JER.3.22	for you are Yahweh our God. 
JER.3.23	Surely, an illusion comes from the hills, 
JER.3.23	the turmoil on the mountains. 
JER.3.23	Surely, in Yahweh our God 
JER.3.23	is the salvation of Israel. 
JER.3.24	But the shameful thing has devoured 
JER.3.24	the labor of our ancestors
JER.3.24	their flocks, and their cattle, 
JER.3.24	their sons and their daughters. 
JER.3.25	Let us lie down in our shame, 
JER.3.25	and let our disgrace cover us. 
JER.3.25	For against Yahweh our God we have sinned, 
JER.3.25	we and our ancestors,
JER.3.25	from our youth and until this day. 
JER.3.25	and we have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God.’ 
JER.4.1	 If you return, O Israel,” declares
JER.4.1	“you return to me. 
JER.4.1	And if you remove your abominations from my presence,
JER.4.1	and you do not wander, 
JER.4.2	and you swear, ‘As Yahweh lives,’
JER.4.2	in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, 
JER.4.2	then nations will be blessed by him, 
JER.4.2	and in him they will boast.” 
JER.4.3	For thus says Yahweh 
JER.4.3	to the men
JER.4.3	“Break up for yourselves prepared virgin soil, 
JER.4.3	and you must not sow among thornbushes. 
JER.4.4	Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, 
JER.4.4	and remove the foreskins of your hearts,
JER.4.4	men
JER.4.4	lest my wrath goes forth like the fire and burns, 
JER.4.4	and there is no one who extinguishes it,
JER.4.4	because of the evil of your deeds.” 
JER.4.5	Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say, 
JER.4.5	“Blow a horn through the land, 
JER.4.5	call with a loud voice
JER.4.5	‘Be gathered and let us go into the fortified cities.’ 
JER.4.6	Lift up a signal toward Zion, 
JER.4.6	bring yourselves to safety; you must not remain standing, 
JER.4.6	for I am bringing evil from the north, 
JER.4.6	and a great destruction. 
JER.4.7	A lion has gone up from his thicket, 
JER.4.7	and a destroyer of nations has set out. 
JER.4.7	He has gone out from his place to make your land as a horror, 
JER.4.7	your cities will go to ruin without
JER.4.8	Because of this gird yourselves with sackcloth,
JER.4.8	for the burning anger
JER.4.9	And then on that day,” declares
JER.4.9	“the heart of the king and the heart of the officials will be destroyed, 
JER.4.9	and the priests will be appalled, 
JER.4.9	and the prophets will be astonished.” 
JER.4.10	Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh, surely you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘It will be peace for you,’ while the sword reaches up to the throat.” 
JER.4.11	At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, 
JER.4.11	“A hot wind from the barren heights
JER.4.11	in the direction of
JER.4.11	not to winnow and not to cleanse, 
JER.4.12	a wind too strong for
JER.4.12	now also I speak judgments against them.” 
JER.4.13	Look, he comes up like the clouds, 
JER.4.13	and his chariots are like the whirlwind, 
JER.4.13	his horses are swifter than eagles, 
JER.4.13	woe to us, for we are devastated. 
JER.4.14	Cleanse your heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, 
JER.4.14	so that you may be saved. 
JER.4.14	How long
JER.4.14	dwell in your inner part? 
JER.4.15	For a voice is declaring from Dan, 
JER.4.15	and is proclaiming disaster from the mountain of Ephraim. 
JER.4.16	“Report to the nations, ‘Here they are!’ 
JER.4.16	Proclaim against Jerusalem, 
JER.4.16	‘Besiegers are coming from a distant land,
JER.4.16	and they raise their voice against the cities of Judah.’ 
JER.4.17	Like watchers of a field they were against her from all around, 
JER.4.17	because she has rebelled against me,” declares
JER.4.18	“You obtained this for yourself 
JER.4.18	because of your way and your deeds. 
JER.4.18	This is your doom, for it is bitter, 
JER.4.18	yes, it has reached up to your heart.” 
JER.4.19	My bowels, my bowels! I writhe! 
JER.4.19	The walls of my heart! 
JER.4.19	My heart is restless within me, I cannot keep silent, 
JER.4.19	for I hear in my inner self the sound of a horn, the alarm of war. 
JER.4.20	Destruction on destruction is proclaimed, 
JER.4.20	for all of the land is devastated. 
JER.4.20	Suddenly my tents are devastated, 
JER.4.20	my tent curtains in a moment. 
JER.4.21	How long must I see the banner, 
JER.4.21	and hear the sound of a horn? 
JER.4.22	“For my people are foolish, 
JER.4.22	they have not known me. 
JER.4.22	They are foolish children, 
JER.4.22	and they do not have insight. 
JER.4.22	They are skillful at doing evil, 
JER.4.22	and they do not know how to do good.” 
JER.4.23	I looked at the earth, and behold, it was wasteland and emptiness, 
JER.4.23	and to the heavens, and they were without their light. 
JER.4.24	I looked at the mountains, and behold, they were quaking, 
JER.4.24	and all of the hills were jolted to and fro. 
JER.4.25	I looked and behold, there was no person, 
JER.4.25	and all of the birds
JER.4.26	I looked and behold, the fruitful land was a desert,
JER.4.26	and all of its cities were ruined before Yahweh, 
JER.4.26	before the face of his burning anger.
JER.4.27	For thus says Yahweh, “All of the land will be a desolation, 
JER.4.27	yet I will not make a complete desolation. 
JER.4.28	Because of this the earth will mourn, 
JER.4.28	and the heavens above will become dark. 
JER.4.28	Because I have spoken, I have planned, 
JER.4.28	and I have not relented, and I will not turn back from it.” 
JER.4.29	From the sound of a horseman and an archer
JER.4.29	they enter in the thickets and among the rocks they climb. 
JER.4.29	Every town is forsaken, 
JER.4.29	and there is no person who lives in them. 
JER.4.30	And you, O devastated one, what do you do, 
JER.4.30	that you put on crimson, 
JER.4.30	that you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold, 
JER.4.30	that you make your eyes look bigger with the eye make-up? 
JER.4.30	In vain you beautify yourself. 
JER.4.30	Your lovers reject you; 
JER.4.30	they seek your life. 
JER.4.31	For I heard a voice like an ill woman, 
JER.4.31	anxiety like a woman who bears her first child, 
JER.4.31	the voice of the daughter of Zion. 
JER.4.31	She is gasping for breath, 
JER.4.31	she is spreading out her hands: 
JER.4.31	“Woe is me, for I am becoming tired
JER.5.1	 “Roam about through the streets of Jerusalem, 
JER.5.1	and look please, and take note, 
JER.5.1	and search at its public squares, 
JER.5.1	if you can find a person who does justice, 
JER.5.1	who seeks honesty, 
JER.5.1	so that I may forgive it. 
JER.5.2	And though they say, ‘As Yahweh lives,’
JER.5.2	therefore
JER.5.3	O Yahweh, do not your eyes look for honesty? 
JER.5.3	You have struck them, but they felt no pain, 
JER.5.3	you have destroyed them, they refused to take discipline. 
JER.5.3	They have hardened their faces more than rock, 
JER.5.3	they have refused to turn back. 
JER.5.4	Then I said, “They are just simple people, 
JER.5.4	they are foolish, 
JER.5.4	for they know not the way of Yahweh, 
JER.5.4	the law
JER.5.5	Let me go to the great, 
JER.5.5	and let me speak with them, 
JER.5.5	for they know the way of Yahweh, 
JER.5.5	the law
JER.5.5	However, they together have broken the yoke, 
JER.5.5	they have torn to pieces the bonds. 
JER.5.6	Therefore a lion from the forest will kill them, 
JER.5.6	A wolf from the desert plains
JER.5.6	A leopard is watching their cities, 
JER.5.6	everyone who goes out from there will be torn, 
JER.5.6	because their transgressions are many, 
JER.5.6	their apostasies are numerous. 
JER.5.7	“How
JER.5.7	Your children have forsaken me, 
JER.5.7	and they have sworn by those who are not gods. 
JER.5.7	But I fed them to the full, 
JER.5.7	and they committed adultery, 
JER.5.7	and flocked to the house of a prostitute. 
JER.5.8	They were well-fed lusty horses, 
JER.5.8	they neighed each to the wife of his neighbor. 
JER.5.9	Because of these things shall I not punish?” declares
JER.5.9	“and on a nation who is like this, shall I not take revenge? 
JER.5.10	Go up through her vineyards and destroy, 
JER.5.10	but you must not make complete destruction. 
JER.5.10	Remove her branches, 
JER.5.10	for they are not to Yahweh. 
JER.5.11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah 
JER.5.11	have dealt utterly treacherously with me,” declares
JER.5.12	“They have denied Yahweh, and have said, 
JER.5.12	‘Not he, for
JER.5.12	we will see neither sword nor famine. 
JER.5.13	And the prophets are like wind, 
JER.5.13	and the word is not in them.’ 
JER.5.13	Thus it will be done to them.” 
JER.5.14	Therefore
JER.5.14	“Because you have spoken this word, 
JER.5.14	look, I am making my words in your mouth like a fire, 
JER.5.14	and this people wood, and it will devour them. 
JER.5.15	Look, I am about to bring on you a nation from afar, 
JER.5.15	O house of Israel,” declares
JER.5.15	“It is an enduring nation, it is an ancient nation.
JER.5.15	A nation whose language you do not know, 
JER.5.15	and you cannot understand what they speak. 
JER.5.16	Their quiver is like an open tomb, 
JER.5.16	all of them are warriors. 
JER.5.17	And they will eat your harvest and your food, 
JER.5.17	they will eat your sons and your daughters, 
JER.5.17	they will eat your flock and your herd, 
JER.5.17	they will eat your vine and your fig tree, 
JER.5.17	they will smash with the sword your fortified cities,
JER.5.17	in which you trust. 
JER.5.18	“But even in those days,” declares
JER.5.19	And then,
JER.5.20	“Declare this in the house of Jacob, 
JER.5.20	and proclaim it in Judah, saying, 
JER.5.21	‘Hear this please, O foolish and senseless
JER.5.21	who have eyes
JER.5.21	who have ears
JER.5.22	Do you not revere me?” declares
JER.5.22	“Do you not tremble before me?
JER.5.22	For I have placed the sand as a boundary for the sea, 
JER.5.22	as an everlasting limit,
JER.5.22	and they rise and fall loudly, but they cannot prevail, 
JER.5.22	and its waves roar, but they cannot pass over it. 
JER.5.23	But for this people is a stubborn and rebellious heart, 
JER.5.23	they have turned aside and have gone away. 
JER.5.24	And they do not say in their hearts, 
JER.5.24	‘Let us fear please Yahweh our God, 
JER.5.24	the one who gives the autumn rain
JER.5.24	the set times of the harvest
JER.5.25	Your iniquities have disturbed these, 
JER.5.25	and your sins have kept away the good from you. 
JER.5.26	For wicked people are found among my people, 
JER.5.26	they lie in wait like the hiding of fowlers, 
JER.5.26	they set up a trap, 
JER.5.26	they catch humans. 
JER.5.27	Like a cage full of birds,
JER.5.27	so their houses are full of fraud. 
JER.5.27	Therefore
JER.5.27	and they have become rich. 
JER.5.28	They have grown fat, 
JER.5.28	they have grown sleek, 
JER.5.28	also, their evil deeds have no limit.
JER.5.28	They do not judge with justice, 
JER.5.28	the legal cause of the orphan, 
JER.5.28	or allow it to succeed, 
JER.5.28	and the legal case of the poor, 
JER.5.28	they do not defend. 
JER.5.29	Because of these things shall I not punish?” declares
JER.5.29	“and on a nation who is like this, shall I not take revenge? 
JER.5.30	A horrific event and something horrible has happened in the land. 
JER.5.31	The prophets prophesy falsely,
JER.5.31	and the priests rule by their own authority,
JER.5.31	and my people love it
JER.5.31	But what will you do when the end comes?
JER.6.1	 Flee for safety, O children of Benjamin, 
JER.6.1	from the midst of Jerusalem. 
JER.6.1	And in Tekoa blow a horn, 
JER.6.1	and on Beth-haccherem lift up a signal, 
JER.6.1	for evil looks down from the north, 
JER.6.1	and a great destruction. 
JER.6.2	The lovely and the delicate, 
JER.6.2	the daughter of Jerusalem, I will destroy. 
JER.6.3	Shepherds and their flocks will come against her, 
JER.6.3	they will pitch their tents against her all around, 
JER.6.3	they will pasture, each his portion.
JER.6.4	Sanctify
JER.6.4	Arise, and let us attack at noon. 
JER.6.4	Woe to us, for the day turns, 
JER.6.4	for the shadows of evening are lengthened. 
JER.6.5	Arise, and let us attack by night, 
JER.6.5	and let us destroy her citadel fortresses.” 
JER.6.6	For thus says Yahweh of hosts, 
JER.6.6	“Cut down trees and heap up a siege ramp against Jerusalem. 
JER.6.6	This is the city that must be punished, 
JER.6.6	its oppression is in its midst. 
JER.6.7	As a water well keeps its water cool, 
JER.6.7	so she keeps cool her wickedness. 
JER.6.7	Violence and destruction are heard within her, 
JER.6.7	sickness and wounds
JER.6.8	Be warned, O Jerusalem, 
JER.6.8	lest I turn away from you in disgust, 
JER.6.8	lest I make you a desolation, 
JER.6.8	a land that is not inhabited.” 
JER.6.9	Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 
JER.6.9	“They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine, 
JER.6.9	turn back your hand over the branches like a grape-gatherer. 
JER.6.10	To whom shall I speak and admonish, 
JER.6.10	that they may hear? 
JER.6.10	Look, their ears are closed,
JER.6.10	and they are not able to listen attentively. 
JER.6.10	Look, the word of Yahweh is to them an object of scorn, 
JER.6.10	they do not delight in it. 
JER.6.11	But I am full with the wrath of Yahweh, 
JER.6.11	I struggle to hold it
JER.6.11	Pour it out on the children
JER.6.11	and on the assemblies
JER.6.11	For even husband with wife will get trapped, 
JER.6.11	the old with him who is full of days. 
JER.6.12	And their houses will be turned over to others, 
JER.6.12	their fields and their wives together. 
JER.6.12	For I will stretch out my hand 
JER.6.12	against the inhabitants of the land,” declares
JER.6.13	“For from the smallest of them to the greatest of them, 
JER.6.13	everyone
JER.6.13	And from the prophet to the priest, 
JER.6.13	everyone
JER.6.14	And they have treated the wound of my people lightly, 
JER.6.14	saying,
JER.6.15	Have they acted ashamed, for they have committed a detestable thing? 
JER.6.15	Not at all, nor were they ashamed; they did not know to feel humiliated. 
JER.6.15	Therefore
JER.6.15	they will stumble,” says Yahweh. 
JER.6.16	Thus says Yahweh: “Stand at the roads and look, 
JER.6.16	and ask for the ancient paths, where the way of the good is, 
JER.6.16	and walk in it, and find rest for your inner selves.
JER.6.16	But they said, ‘We will not walk in it.’
JER.6.17	And I raised up watchmen over you: 
JER.6.17	‘Listen attentively to the sound of a horn.’ 
JER.6.17	But they said, ‘We will not listen attentively.’ 
JER.6.18	Therefore
JER.6.18	what will happen to them.
JER.6.19	Hear, O earth, 
JER.6.19	look, I am about to bring disaster to this people, 
JER.6.19	the fruit of their plans, 
JER.6.19	because they have not listened attentively to my words, 
JER.6.19	and my teaching, they have rejected it also. 
JER.6.20	What is this to me? 
JER.6.20	Frankincense comes from Sheba, 
JER.6.20	and the precious spice reed from a distant land. 
JER.6.20	Your burnt offerings are not acceptable,
JER.6.20	your sacrifices are not pleasing to me.” 
JER.6.21	Therefore
JER.6.21	“Look, I am about to put before this people stumbling blocks, 
JER.6.21	and they will stumble against them, 
JER.6.21	fathers and children together, 
JER.6.21	neighbor and his friend will perish.” 
JER.6.22	Thus says Yahweh: 
JER.6.22	“Look, a people is coming from the land of the north, 
JER.6.22	a great nation is woken up from the farthest part of the earth. 
JER.6.23	The bow and the short sword they grasp are cruel, 
JER.6.23	and they show no mercy. 
JER.6.23	Their sound roars like the sea, and on horses they ride, 
JER.6.23	drawn up like a man for battle against you, O daughter of Zion.” 
JER.6.24	We have heard news of it, 
JER.6.24	our hands grow slack, 
JER.6.24	anxiety has grasped us, 
JER.6.24	pain as a woman who gives birth. 
JER.6.25	You must not go out into the field, 
JER.6.25	and you must not walk on the road, 
JER.6.25	for the enemy has a sword,
JER.6.25	terror is all around. 
JER.6.26	O daughter of my people, 
JER.6.26	gird yourself with sackcloth, 
JER.6.26	and roll about in the ashes in mourning, 
JER.6.26	a mourning ceremony as for an only child. 
JER.6.26	Make for yourself wailing of bitterness, 
JER.6.26	for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us. 
JER.6.27	“I have made you an assayer among my people, a fortification, 
JER.6.27	so that you may know and put to the test their ways.
JER.6.28	All of them are stubborn rebels, 
JER.6.28	going about talking slander. 
JER.6.28	They are bronze and iron, 
JER.6.28	they are all behaving corruptly. 
JER.6.29	The bellows
JER.6.29	lead is consumed by fire. 
JER.6.29	In vain
JER.6.29	but the wicked are not torn apart. 
JER.6.30	They are called
JER.6.30	For Yahweh has rejected them.” 
JER.7.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
JER.7.2	“Stand in the gate of the house of Yahweh and proclaim there this word, and say, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, all of Judah, those who enter through these gates to bow in worship to Yahweh. 
JER.7.3	Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “Make your ways and your deeds good and let me dwell with you in this place. 
JER.7.4	Do not trust in the deceitful words,
JER.7.5	For if you truly make your ways and your deeds good, if you truly do justice between a man and his neighbor, 
JER.7.6	you do not oppress the alien, the orphan, and the widow, you do not shed innocent blood in this place, and you do not go after other gods to your harm,
JER.7.7	then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your ancestors
JER.7.8	Look, you are relying for yourselves on deceitful words
JER.7.9	Will you steal? Will you murder? And will you commit adultery? And will you swear falsely?
JER.7.10	And then you come and you stand before
JER.7.11	Has this house, which is called by my name,
JER.7.12	“For go now to my place that was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell in the beginning, and see what I did to it because of
JER.7.13	And now, because of your doing all these things,” declares
JER.7.14	therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name,
JER.7.15	And I will cast you out of my sight
JER.7.16	“And you, you must not pray for this people, and you must not lift up for them a cry of entreaty or a prayer, and you must not plead with me, for I will not hear you. 
JER.7.17	Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	The children are gathering wood, and the fathers are kindling the fire, and the women are kneading dough to make sacrificial cakes for the queen of heaven, and they pour out libations to other gods for the sake of provoking me to anger. 
JER.7.19	Are they provoking me to anger? ” declares
JER.7.20	Therefore
JER.7.21	Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh. 
JER.7.22	For I did not speak with your ancestors,
JER.7.23	But I only commanded them this word, saying,
JER.7.24	Yet they did not obey, and they did not incline their ear, but they walked in their own plans, in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and they became worse instead of better.
JER.7.25	From the day that your ancestors
JER.7.26	Yet they have not listened to me and they have not inclined their ear, but they have hardened their neck, they did more evil than their ancestors.
JER.7.27	So you shall speak to them all these words, but they will not listen to you, and you shall call to them, but they will not answer you. 
JER.7.28	“And you shall say to them, ‘This is the nation that has not obeyed the voice of Yahweh their God, and they have not accepted discipline. The truth has perished, and it is cut off from their mouths.
JER.7.29	Shear your hair and throw it
JER.7.30	For the people 
JER.7.31	And they built the high place of Topheth, which is in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I have not commanded, and it did not come into my mind.
JER.7.32	Therefore look, days are about to come,” declares
JER.7.33	And the dead bodies
JER.7.34	And I will cause to disappear from the towns of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the sound of jubilation, and the sound of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, for the land will become a site of ruins. 
JER.8.1	 “At that time,” declares
JER.8.2	And they shall spread them out before the sun, and before the moon, and before all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and which they have gone after, and which they have inquired about, and to which they have bowed in worship. They shall not be gathered, and they shall not be buried; they will be like dung on the surface of the ground. 
JER.8.3	And death will be preferred to life by all the remaining of this evil clan
JER.8.4	“And you shall say to them, ‘Thus asks
JER.8.4	“Do men fall and not stand up? 
JER.8.4	If one turns away does he not return? 
JER.8.5	Why has this people, Jerusalem, turned away in enduring apostasy? 
JER.8.5	They have kept hold of deceit, they have refused to return.
JER.8.6	I have listened attentively, 
JER.8.6	and I have listened. 
JER.8.6	They do not speak honestly, 
JER.8.6	there is no man who regrets his wickedness, saying, ‘What have I done?’ 
JER.8.6	All of them are turning to their ways of running, 
JER.8.6	like a horse plunging into battle. 
JER.8.7	Even the stork in heaven knows its appointed time, 
JER.8.7	and the turtledove, and the swallow, and the song bird, 
JER.8.7	they observe the time of their coming. 
JER.8.7	But my people do not know the ordinance
JER.8.8	How can you say, ‘We are wise and the law of Yahweh is with us’? 
JER.8.8	Look, surely the lying stylus of the scribes
JER.8.9	The wise will be put to shame, 
JER.8.9	they will be dismayed, 
JER.8.9	and they will get taken. 
JER.8.9	Look, they have rejected the word of Yahweh, 
JER.8.9	and what is wisdom to them? 
JER.8.10	Therefore I will give their wives to others, 
JER.8.10	their fields to conquerors, 
JER.8.10	because from the smallest to the greatest, 
JER.8.10	all of them make profit for unlawful gain, 
JER.8.10	from prophet to priest, 
JER.8.10	all of them practice deceit. 
JER.8.11	And they have treated the wound of the daughter of my people lightly, 
JER.8.11	saying,
JER.8.12	Were they ashamed, for they had committed a detestable thing? 
JER.8.12	What’s worse,
JER.8.12	and they did not know to feel humiliated. 
JER.8.12	Therefore
JER.8.12	at the time of their punishment they will stumble,” says Yahweh. 
JER.8.13	“I will take away their harvest,”
JER.8.13	“There are no grapes on the vine, 
JER.8.13	and there are no figs on the fig tree, 
JER.8.13	and the leaves wither, 
JER.8.13	and what I gave to them passed over them.” ’ ” 
JER.8.14	Why are we sitting? 
JER.8.14	Gather, and let us go into the fortified cities, 
JER.8.14	and let us perish there, 
JER.8.14	for Yahweh our God has caused us to perish, 
JER.8.14	and has provided drink for us, water of poison, 
JER.8.14	because we have sinned against Yahweh. 
JER.8.15	We hope for peace, 
JER.8.15	but there is no good, 
JER.8.15	for a time of healing, 
JER.8.15	but there is terror. 
JER.8.16	“From Dan is heard the snorting of their horses, 
JER.8.16	from the sound of the neighing of their stallions all the land quakes, 
JER.8.16	for they come and devour the land, 
JER.8.16	and that which fills the city, 
JER.8.16	and those who live in it. 
JER.8.17	For look, I am letting loose among you snakes, 
JER.8.17	adders for which there is no incantation, 
JER.8.17	and they will bite you,” declares
JER.8.18	“My comfort is gone from me, 
JER.8.18	sorrow is on me, 
JER.8.18	my heart is sick. 
JER.8.19	Look, the sound of the cry for help of the daughter of my people 
JER.8.19	from a distant land, 
JER.8.19	‘Is Yahweh not in Zion? 
JER.8.19	Is her king not in her?’ 
JER.8.19	Why have they provoked me to anger with their images, 
JER.8.19	with idols of a foreign land?” 
JER.8.20	The harvest has passed, 
JER.8.20	the summer has come to an end, 
JER.8.20	and we have not received help.
JER.8.21	“Because of the wound of the daughter of my people I am broken down, 
JER.8.21	I mourn, horror has seized me. 
JER.8.22	Is there no balm in Gilead? 
JER.8.22	Is there no healer there? 
JER.8.22	Why, then, has the healing of the daughter of my people not been restored? 
JER.9.1	and my eyes a fountain of tears, 
JER.9.1	so that I might weep day and night, 
JER.9.1	for the slain of the daughter of my people. 
JER.9.2	Oh that I had
JER.9.2	that I may leave my people and go from them, 
JER.9.2	for all of them are adulterers, 
JER.9.2	a band of traitors. 
JER.9.3	And they bend their tongue like their bow, 
JER.9.3	for falsehood and not truth is superior in the land, 
JER.9.3	for they go forth
JER.9.3	and they do not know me,” declares
JER.9.4	“Let everyone be on your guard against his neighbor, 
JER.9.4	and you must not trust in any brother, 
JER.9.4	for everyone surely betrays, 
JER.9.4	and every neighbor goes about with slander. 
JER.9.5	And everyone deceives his neighbor, 
JER.9.5	and they do not speak the truth, 
JER.9.5	they have taught their tongues
JER.9.5	they are tired from going astray. 
JER.9.6	Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit, 
JER.9.6	upon
JER.9.7	Therefore, thus says Yahweh of hosts: 
JER.9.7	“Look, I am about to refine them, 
JER.9.7	and I will test them, 
JER.9.7	for what else can I do, 
JER.9.7	because of the presence
JER.9.8	Their tongue is a murderous arrow, 
JER.9.8	it speaks deceit. 
JER.9.8	With his mouth he speaks peace with his neighbor, 
JER.9.8	but in his inner parts he sets up his ambush. 
JER.9.9	Because of these things shall I not punish them?” declares
JER.9.9	“On a nation that is like this shall I not take revenge? 
JER.9.10	For the mountains I lift up weeping and wailing, 
JER.9.10	and for the pastures of the desert a lament, 
JER.9.10	because they are laid waste so that no man passes through. 
JER.9.10	And the sounds
JER.9.10	from the birds
JER.9.10	they have fled, they are gone. 
JER.9.11	And I will make Jerusalem as heaps of ruins, a lair of jackals, 
JER.9.11	and the towns of Judah I will make a desolation, without inhabitants.
JER.9.12	Who is the wise man that can understand this? 
JER.9.12	And to whom has the mouth of Yahweh spoken, so that he may declare it? 
JER.9.12	Why is the land destroyed? 
JER.9.12	It is laid waste like the desert
JER.9.13	And Yahweh said, “Because of their forsaking my law that I set before
JER.9.14	but they went after the stubbornness of their heart, and after the Baals, which their ancestors
JER.9.15	Therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “Look, I am feeding this people wormwood, and providing drink for them, water of poison, 
JER.9.16	and I will scatter them among the nations that they have not known, they and their ancestors,
JER.9.17	Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 
JER.9.17	“Consider closely, and call for the wailing women, so that they come, 
JER.9.17	and for the skillful women, so that they come. 
JER.9.18	And let them hasten, 
JER.9.18	and let them lift up wailing over us, 
JER.9.18	so that our eyes may melt with tears, 
JER.9.18	and our eyelids may flow with water. 
JER.9.19	For a sound of wailing is heard from Zion, 
JER.9.19	‘How we are devastated! 
JER.9.19	We are very ashamed because we have left the land, 
JER.9.19	because they have overthrown our dwelling places.’ 
JER.9.20	For hear, O women, the word of Yahweh, 
JER.9.20	and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, 
JER.9.20	and teach your daughters a lamentation, 
JER.9.20	and each woman her neighbor a lament. 
JER.9.21	For death has come into our windows, 
JER.9.21	it has entered into our fortresses, 
JER.9.21	to cut off the children
JER.9.21	the young men from the public squares. 
JER.9.22	Speak, ‘thus declares
JER.9.22	“The dead body of the human will fall 
JER.9.22	like dung upon the surface of the field, 
JER.9.22	and like cut grain behind the reaper, 
JER.9.22	and there is no one who gathers.” ’ ” 
JER.9.23	Thus says Yahweh, 
JER.9.23	“The wise man must not boast in his wisdom, 
JER.9.23	and the warrior must not boast in his might, 
JER.9.23	the wealthy man must not boast in his wealth. 
JER.9.24	But only
JER.9.24	that he has insight, 
JER.9.24	and that he knows me, 
JER.9.24	that I am Yahweh, 
JER.9.24	showing loyal love, justice, and righteousness on the earth, 
JER.9.24	for in these things I delight,” declares
JER.9.25	“Look, days are coming,” declares
JER.9.26	Egypt, Judah, and Edom, and the Ammonites,
JER.10.1	 Hear the word that Yahweh speaks to you, O house of Israel. 
JER.10.2	Thus says Yahweh: 
JER.10.2	“You must not learn the way of the nations, 
JER.10.2	and you must not be dismayed by the signs of the heavens, 
JER.10.2	for the nations are dismayed by them. 
JER.10.3	For the statutes of the peoples are vanity, 
JER.10.3	for it is a tree cut down from the forest, 
JER.10.3	the work of the hands of a craftsman with the tool. 
JER.10.4	He decorates it with silver and gold, 
JER.10.4	they strengthen it with nails and hammers, 
JER.10.4	so that it does not stagger. 
JER.10.5	They are like scarecrows
JER.10.5	they cannot speak. 
JER.10.5	Indeed, they must be carried, 
JER.10.5	for they cannot march. 
JER.10.5	You must not be afraid of them, 
JER.10.5	for they cannot do evil; 
JER.10.5	furthermore, to do good is not in them.” 
JER.10.6	There is none like you, O Yahweh, 
JER.10.6	you are great and your name is great in might. 
JER.10.7	Who would not revere you, O king of the nations? 
JER.10.7	For you it is fitting. 
JER.10.7	For among all the wise men of the nations, 
JER.10.7	and in all their kingdoms,
JER.10.7	there is none like you. 
JER.10.8	At the same time
JER.10.8	in the instruction of idols, it is wood. 
JER.10.9	Silver beaten from Tarshish is brought, 
JER.10.9	and gold from Uphaz, 
JER.10.9	the work of the craftsman and the hands of the goldsmith. 
JER.10.9	Blue and purple are their clothing, 
JER.10.9	all of them are the work of skillful people. 
JER.10.10	But Yahweh is the true God, 
JER.10.10	he is the living God, 
JER.10.10	and an everlasting king.
JER.10.10	Because of his wrath the earth quakes, 
JER.10.10	and the nations cannot endure his anger. 
JER.10.11	“Thus
JER.10.11	‘Gods who did not make the heavens and the earth 
JER.10.11	will perish from the earth and from under these heavens. 
JER.10.12	He is the maker of the earth by his power, 
JER.10.12	who created the world by his wisdom, 
JER.10.12	and by his understanding he stretched out heaven. 
JER.10.13	When he utters his voice
JER.10.13	and he causes the mist to rise from the ends
JER.10.13	He makes lightning for the rain, 
JER.10.13	and he causes the wind to go out from his storehouses. 
JER.10.14	Everyone
JER.10.14	every goldsmith is ashamed by his divine image, 
JER.10.14	for his cast image is an illusion, 
JER.10.14	and there is no breath in them. 
JER.10.15	They are vanity, a work of mockery, 
JER.10.15	at the time of their punishment, they will perish. 
JER.10.16	The portion of Jacob is not like these, 
JER.10.16	for he is the creator of everything, 
JER.10.16	and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance, 
JER.10.16	Yahweh of hosts is his name. 
JER.10.17	Gather your bundle from the ground, 
JER.10.17	you who live under the siege.’ ” 
JER.10.18	For thus says Yahweh, 
JER.10.18	“Look, I am about to sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, 
JER.10.18	and I will bring distress to them, so that they may feel it.” 
JER.10.19	Woe to me, because of my wound. 
JER.10.19	My wound is incurable. 
JER.10.19	But I said, “Surely this is my sickness, 
JER.10.19	and I must bear it.” 
JER.10.20	My tent is devastated, 
JER.10.20	and all my tent cords are torn. 
JER.10.20	My children have gone out from me, 
JER.10.20	and they are not. 
JER.10.20	There is no one who pitches my tent again, 
JER.10.20	or one who puts up my tent curtains. 
JER.10.21	For the shepherds have become stupid, 
JER.10.21	they do not seek Yahweh. 
JER.10.21	Therefore
JER.10.21	and all of their flock are scattered. 
JER.10.22	Listen, news:
JER.10.22	Look, it is coming, 
JER.10.22	a great roar from the land of the north, 
JER.10.22	to make the cities of Judah a desolation, 
JER.10.22	a lair of jackals. 
JER.10.23	I know, O Yahweh, that to the human is not his own way, 
JER.10.23	nor to a person is the walking and the directing of his own step. 
JER.10.24	Chastise
JER.10.24	not in your anger, lest you eradicate me. 
JER.10.25	Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you, 
JER.10.25	and on the peoples that do not call on your name, 
JER.10.25	for they have devoured Jacob, 
JER.10.25	they have devoured and consumed him, 
JER.10.25	and they have caused his settlement to be desolate. 
JER.11.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
JER.11.2	“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the people
JER.11.3	and say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: “The man is cursed who does not obey the words of this covenant, 
JER.11.4	which I commanded your ancestors
JER.11.5	in order to keep the oath that I swore to your ancestors,
JER.11.6	And Yahweh said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying,
JER.11.7	for I solemnly admonished your ancestors
JER.11.8	But they did not obey and they did not incline their ear. Instead each one walked in the stubbornness of his
JER.11.9	And Yahweh said to me, “A conspiracy is found among the people
JER.11.10	They have turned back to the iniquities of their former ancestors,
JER.11.11	Therefore
JER.11.12	Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they are making smoke offerings, but they will certainly not save them in the time of their trouble. 
JER.11.13	For the number of your towns are your gods, O Judah, and the number of the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful things, to make smoke offerings to Baal. 
JER.11.14	Therefore you must not pray for this people, and you must not lift up for them a cry of entreaty, or a prayer, for I will not listen in the time of their calling to me, in the time of their trouble. 
JER.11.15	What rights has my beloved in my house
JER.11.15	when she has done many wicked things?
JER.11.15	Can the flesh of holiness pass over you? 
JER.11.15	For you engage in your wickedness,
JER.11.16	Yahweh called your name, ‘A leafy olive tree, beautiful with fine fruit.’
JER.11.16	With the sound of a great storm he will set fire to it, 
JER.11.16	and its branches will be good for nothing. 
JER.11.17	And Yahweh of hosts, the one who planted you, 
JER.11.17	has spoken evil against you, 
JER.11.17	because of the evil of the house of Israel and the house of Judah, 
JER.11.17	that they have done to themselves, 
JER.11.17	to provoke me to anger by making smoke offerings to Baal.” 
JER.11.18	Moreover, Yahweh let it be made known to me, and I knew. 
JER.11.18	Then you showed me their deeds. 
JER.11.19	And I was like a gentle ram-lamb that is brought to slaughter, 
JER.11.19	and I did not know that they planned plans against me, saying, 
JER.11.19	“Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, 
JER.11.19	and let us cut him off from the land of the living, 
JER.11.19	so that his name will no longer be remembered.” 
JER.11.20	But O Yahweh of hosts, who judges in righteousness, 
JER.11.20	who tests the inmost being,
JER.11.20	let me see your retribution upon them, 
JER.11.20	for to you I have revealed my legal case. 
JER.11.21	Therefore
JER.11.22	Therefore
JER.11.23	And a remnant will not be left for them, for I will bring disaster to the people
JER.12.1	You will be in the right, O Yahweh, when I complain to you. 
JER.12.1	Even so, let me speak my claims with you. 
JER.12.1	Why does the way of the wicked succeed? 
JER.12.1	All those who deal treacherously with treachery are at ease. 
JER.12.2	Not only do you plant them, they take root. 
JER.12.2	They grow, but also they produce fruit. 
JER.12.2	You are near in their mouths, 
JER.12.2	but far from their inmost beings.
JER.12.3	But you, O Yahweh, you know me, 
JER.12.3	you see me, and you test that my heart is with you. 
JER.12.3	Tear them apart like sheep for the slaughtering, 
JER.12.3	and set them apart for the day of slaughter. 
JER.12.4	How long
JER.12.4	because of the wickedness of those who live in it? 
JER.12.4	The animals and the birds
JER.12.4	because they have said, “He does not see our future.” 
JER.12.5	“If you run with foot soldiers and they have made you weary, 
JER.12.5	then how will you compete with horses? 
JER.12.5	If you have fallen in a peaceful land,
JER.12.5	then how will you do in the thickets of the Jordan? 
JER.12.6	For even your relatives, and the house of your father, 
JER.12.6	even they have dealt treacherously with you, 
JER.12.6	even they call loudly
JER.12.6	You must not trust in them, though they speak kindly to you. 
JER.12.7	I have forsaken my house, I have abandoned my inheritance. 
JER.12.7	I have given the beloved one of my heart
JER.12.8	My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest. 
JER.12.8	She has lifted up against me her voice; therefore
JER.12.9	The lair of the hyena is my inheritance to me, 
JER.12.9	the birds of prey
JER.12.9	Go, gather all of the animals
JER.12.9	bring them to come and devour.
JER.12.10	Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, 
JER.12.10	they have trampled down my plot of land. 
JER.12.10	They have made my pleasant field
JER.12.10	like the desert
JER.12.11	They have made it a desolation. 
JER.12.11	Desolate, it mourns to me. 
JER.12.11	All the land is made desolate, 
JER.12.11	but there is no person taking it to heart. 
JER.12.12	Upon all the barren heights in the desert
JER.12.12	for the sword of Yahweh devours, 
JER.12.12	from one end of the land to the other end of the land, 
JER.12.12	there is no peace for all flesh. 
JER.12.13	They have sown wheat and they have reaped thorns. 
JER.12.13	They are exhausted, they do not profit. 
JER.12.13	And they will be ashamed of your produce, 
JER.12.13	because of the burning anger
JER.12.14	Thus says Yahweh concerning all of the evil neighbors who touch the inheritance that I gave as an inheritance to my people Israel: “Look, I am about to drive them out from their land, and the house of Judah I will drive out from among them. 
JER.12.15	And then
JER.12.16	And then,
JER.12.17	But if they do not listen, then I will completely uproot and destroy that nation.”
JER.13.1	Thus Yahweh said to me: “Go and buy for yourself a loincloth of linen and put it on your loins, but you must not place
JER.13.2	So I bought the loincloth according to the word of Yahweh and I put it
JER.13.3	Now the word of Yahweh came to me a second time, saying,
JER.13.4	“Take the loincloth that you bought, that is on your loins, and stand up, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in the cleft of the rock.” 
JER.13.5	So I went and hid it by the Euphrates just as Yahweh had commanded me. 
JER.13.6	And then,
JER.13.7	Then I went to the Euphrates and I dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it, and look, the loincloth was ruined; it was not good for anything. 
JER.13.8	And then
JER.13.9	“Thus says Yahweh: ‘So I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. 
JER.13.10	This evil people, who refuse to listen to my words, who go
JER.13.11	For as the loincloth clings to the loins of a person, so I caused to cling to me all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah,’ declares
JER.13.12	“Therefore, you shall say to them this word, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: “Every jar must be filled with wine.” ’ And they will say to you, ‘Do we not certainly know that every jar should be filled with wine?’ 
JER.13.13	Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “Look, I am about to fill all the inhabitants of this land, and the kings who sit on David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with drunkenness. 
JER.13.14	And I will smash them, each one against his brother, and the fathers and the sons together,” declares
JER.13.15	Listen, and pay attention, 
JER.13.15	you must not be haughty, for Yahweh has spoken. 
JER.13.16	Give glory to Yahweh your God before
JER.13.16	and before
JER.13.16	And you will hope for light, but he makes it as gloom, 
JER.13.16	he makes it
JER.13.17	But if you will not listen to it, 
JER.13.17	my inner self
JER.13.17	because of the presence of
JER.13.17	And my eyes
JER.13.17	and they will melt in tears, 
JER.13.17	because the flock of Yahweh has been taken captive. 
JER.13.18	“Say to the king and to the queen mother, ‘Take a lower seat,
JER.13.18	for your beautiful crown
JER.13.19	The towns of the Negev are shut up, 
JER.13.19	and there is no one who opens them.
JER.13.19	All of Judah is deported; 
JER.13.19	it is deported in completeness. 
JER.13.20	Lift up your eyes 
JER.13.20	and see those coming from the north. 
JER.13.20	Where is the flock that was given to you, 
JER.13.20	your magnificent flock?
JER.13.21	What will you say when he sets over you— 
JER.13.21	and you have taught them—allies as head over you? 
JER.13.21	Will not labor pains take hold of you, 
JER.13.21	like a woman giving birth? 
JER.13.22	And if you say in your heart, 
JER.13.22	‘Why have these things happened to me?’ 
JER.13.22	Because of the greatness of your iniquity your skirts are uncovered; 
JER.13.22	your heels have endured violence. 
JER.13.23	Can a Cushite change his skin, 
JER.13.23	or a leopard his spots? 
JER.13.23	Then you also will be able to do good, 
JER.13.23	who are accustomed to doing evil. 
JER.13.24	And I will scatter them 
JER.13.24	like stubble scattered by the wind of the desert.
JER.13.25	This is your lot, 
JER.13.25	the portion of your measure from me,” declares
JER.13.25	“because you have forgotten me, 
JER.13.25	and you have trusted in the lie. 
JER.13.26	So in turn I will bare your skirts over your face, 
JER.13.26	and your shame will become visible. 
JER.13.27	Your adulteries, and your neighings, 
JER.13.27	the shameful behavior of your fornications 
JER.13.27	on the hills in the countryside, 
JER.13.27	I have seen your abominations. 
JER.13.27	Woe to you, O Jerusalem! 
JER.13.27	How long will you continue to be unclean?
JER.14.1	That which came as the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah concerning the matter
JER.14.2	“Judah mourns, and her gates languish, 
JER.14.2	they are in mourning on the ground, 
JER.14.2	and the cry of lament of Jerusalem goes up. 
JER.14.3	And their nobles send their servants for water. 
JER.14.3	They come to the pits, they find no water. 
JER.14.3	They return with their vessels empty.
JER.14.3	They are ashamed, and they are confounded, 
JER.14.3	and they cover their heads.
JER.14.4	Because of the ground, which is cracked 
JER.14.4	because there was no rain on the ground. 
JER.14.4	The farmers are ashamed, 
JER.14.4	they cover their heads.
JER.14.5	For even the doe in the field gives birth and forsakes her young,
JER.14.5	because there is no green growth. 
JER.14.6	And wild asses stand on the barren heights, 
JER.14.6	they gasp for breath like the jackals. 
JER.14.6	Their eyes fail 
JER.14.6	because there is no vegetation.” 
JER.14.7	Although our iniquities testify against us, O Yahweh, 
JER.14.7	act for the sake of your name. 
JER.14.7	Yes, our apostasies are many; 
JER.14.7	we have sinned against you. 
JER.14.8	You are the hope of Israel, 
JER.14.8	its savior in time of distress. 
JER.14.8	Why should you be like an alien in the land, 
JER.14.8	or like a traveler who spreads out his tent 
JER.14.9	Why should you be like a confused man, 
JER.14.9	like a warrior who is not able to help? 
JER.14.9	Yet you are in our midst, O Yahweh, 
JER.14.9	and your name is called upon us. 
JER.14.9	You must not leave us! 
JER.14.10	Thus says Yahweh concerning this people: 
JER.14.10	“They have loved so much to wander, 
JER.14.10	they have not spared their feet. 
JER.14.10	Therefore Yahweh is not favorable to them, 
JER.14.10	now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins.” 
JER.14.11	So Yahweh said to me, “You must not pray for this people, for their happiness.
JER.14.12	Although they fast, I am not listening to their cry of entreaty. And although they present burnt offering and grain offering, I am not favorable to them. But by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague, I am about to destroy them.” 
JER.14.13	Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh, look, the prophets are saying to them, ‘You will not see the sword, and famine will not be yours, but reliable peace I will give to you in this place.’ ” 
JER.14.14	And Yahweh said to me, “The prophets are prophesying lies
JER.14.15	Therefore
JER.14.16	And the people to whom they are prophesying will be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem because of
JER.14.17	“And you shall say to them this word, 
JER.14.17	‘Let my eyes melt with tears night and day, 
JER.14.17	and let them not cease, 
JER.14.17	for with a great wound the virgin daughter of my people is broken, 
JER.14.17	with a very incurable wound. 
JER.14.18	If I go out into the field, 
JER.14.18	then look, those slain by the sword. 
JER.14.18	And if I enter the city, 
JER.14.18	then look, the sickness of the famine. 
JER.14.18	For both prophet and priest wander around through the land, 
JER.14.18	they do not know what is going on.’ ”
JER.14.19	Have you completely rejected Judah? 
JER.14.19	Or has your soul
JER.14.19	Why have you struck us 
JER.14.19	so that there is no healing for us? 
JER.14.19	We hope for peace, but there is no good, 
JER.14.19	and for a time of healing, but look, there is terror. 
JER.14.20	We know, O Yahweh, our wickedness, 
JER.14.20	the iniquity of our ancestors,
JER.14.20	for we have sinned against you. 
JER.14.21	You must not spurn us
JER.14.21	you must not dishonor your glorious throne.
JER.14.21	Remember us!
JER.14.21	You must not break your covenant with us. 
JER.14.22	Are there any among the idols of the nation who cause rain to pour? 
JER.14.22	Or can the heavens give showers? 
JER.14.22	Is it not you, O Yahweh our God? 
JER.14.22	Therefore, we hope in you, for you do all these things. 
JER.15.1	Then Yahweh said to me, “Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me,
JER.15.2	And then
JER.15.2	“Those who are destined for the plague, to the plague, 
JER.15.2	and those who are destined for the sword, to the sword, 
JER.15.2	and those who are destined for the famine, to the famine, 
JER.15.2	and those who are destined for the captivity, to the captivity.” ’ 
JER.15.3	“And I will summon
JER.15.4	And I will make them a terror to all of the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, because of what he did in Jerusalem. 
JER.15.5	“For who will have compassion on you, O Jerusalem, 
JER.15.5	or who will show sympathy to you, 
JER.15.5	or who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?
JER.15.6	You have forsaken me,” declares
JER.15.6	“You go backward, so I have stretched my hand against you, 
JER.15.6	and I have destroyed you. 
JER.15.6	I am tired of becoming remorseful. 
JER.15.7	And I have winnowed them with a winnowing fork in the gates of the land. 
JER.15.7	I am bereaved. 
JER.15.7	I have destroyed my people. 
JER.15.7	They did not turn back from their ways. 
JER.15.8	Their widows
JER.15.8	I have brought to them, against the mothers
JER.15.8	a destroyer at noon. 
JER.15.8	I will suddenly drop on her anguish and horror.
JER.15.9	She who gave birth to seven has withered away. 
JER.15.9	She gasps her breath. 
JER.15.9	Her sun set
JER.15.9	She has been put to shame and disgraced. 
JER.15.9	And the remainder of them I will give to the sword 
JER.15.9	before
JER.15.10	Woe to me, O my mother, that you gave birth to me, 
JER.15.10	a man of contention and quarreling to the whole land.
JER.15.10	I have not lent out and I have not borrowed.
JER.15.10	All of them are cursing me. 
JER.15.11	Yahweh said, 
JER.15.11	“Surely
JER.15.11	surely
JER.15.11	in a time of trouble, 
JER.15.11	and in a time of distress. 
JER.15.12	Can anyone break iron, 
JER.15.12	iron from the north, or bronze? 
JER.15.13	I will give your wealth and your treasures 
JER.15.13	as plunder without price, 
JER.15.13	even because of all your sins, 
JER.15.13	and throughout all your territories. 
JER.15.14	And I will make you serve your enemies 
JER.15.14	in a land that you do not know, 
JER.15.14	for a fire will kindle in my anger. 
JER.15.14	Upon you it will be kindled.” 
JER.15.15	You who know, O Yahweh, remember me, and attend to me, 
JER.15.15	and take revenge for me against my persecutors in your forbearance.
JER.15.15	You must take me away. 
JER.15.15	Know that I am carrying disgrace because of you. 
JER.15.16	Your words were found and I ate them, 
JER.15.16	and your words became to me as jubilation, 
JER.15.16	even as the joy of my heart, 
JER.15.16	for your name is called on me, O Yahweh God of hosts. 
JER.15.17	I sat not in the assembly of jokers, 
JER.15.17	nor did I exult. 
JER.15.17	Because of the presence
JER.15.17	for you filled me with indignation. 
JER.15.18	Why is my pain endless, and my wound incurable? 
JER.15.18	It refuses to become healed. 
JER.15.18	Truly you are to me like a deceitful brook, 
JER.15.18	waters that are not trustworthy. 
JER.15.19	Therefore thus says Yahweh, 
JER.15.19	“If you turn back, then I will take you back. 
JER.15.19	You will stand before me.
JER.15.19	And if you utter what is precious and not what is worthless, 
JER.15.19	you will be as my mouth. 
JER.15.19	They will turn back to you, 
JER.15.19	and you will not turn back to them. 
JER.15.20	And I will make you to this people 
JER.15.20	a wall of fortified bronze, 
JER.15.20	and they will fight against you, 
JER.15.20	but they will not prevail over you, 
JER.15.20	for I am with you, to save you, 
JER.15.20	and to deliver you,” declares
JER.15.21	“And I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked, 
JER.15.21	and I will redeem you from the hand of the tyrant.” 
JER.16.1	And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
JER.16.2	“You shall not take for yourself a wife, there shall not be for you sons and daughters in this place.” 
JER.16.3	For thus says Yahweh concerning the sons and concerning the daughters born in this place, and concerning their mothers who gave birth to them, and concerning their fathers who fathered them in this land: 
JER.16.4	“They will die by diseases, they will not be mourned, and they will not be buried. They will be as dung on the face of the earth. And they will perish by the sword and they will perish by the famine. And their dead bodies
JER.16.5	For thus says Yahweh, “You must not enter the house of the funeral meal, and you must not go to lament, and you must not show sympathy for them, for I have taken away my peace from this people,” declares
JER.16.6	Both the great and small will die in this land. They will not be buried, and they will not mourn for them, and no one will cut himself with a blade, and no one will shave himself for them. 
JER.16.7	And they will not break bread for the mourning ceremony for them, to comfort him because of the dead. And they will not give drink to them, the cup of desolation, for their fathers,
JER.16.8	And you shall not enter the house of the banquet, to sit with them, to eat and drink.” 
JER.16.9	For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “Look, I am about to cause to disappear from this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of jubilation, and the voice of joy, and the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride. 
JER.16.10	And then
JER.16.11	Then you shall say to them, ‘Because
JER.16.12	And you have behaved badly
JER.16.13	So I will throw you from this land to the land that you have not known, you or your ancestors,
JER.16.14	Therefore
JER.16.15	but only
JER.16.16	Look, I am sending for many fishermen,’ declares
JER.16.17	For my eyes are on all their ways, they are not hidden from before me,
JER.16.18	And I will first doubly repay
JER.16.19	O Yahweh, my strength, and my stronghold, 
JER.16.19	and my refuge in the day of distress, 
JER.16.19	to you the nations will come from the ends of the earth, 
JER.16.19	and they will say, “Our ancestors
JER.16.19	vanity, and there is no profit in them. 
JER.16.20	Can a human make for himself gods? 
JER.16.20	Yet they are not gods!” 
JER.16.21	“Therefore
JER.16.21	this time I am going to let them know 
JER.16.21	my power
JER.16.21	and they will know that my name is Yahweh.” 
JER.17.1	“The sin of Judah is written with an iron stylus, 
JER.17.1	with a point of diamond it is engraved 
JER.17.1	on the tablet of their heart, 
JER.17.1	and on the horns of their altars. 
JER.17.2	As the remembering of their children, 
JER.17.2	so is the remembering of their altars 
JER.17.2	and their poles of Asherah worship 
JER.17.2	beside the leafy trees
JER.17.3	O my mountain in the open country, 
JER.17.3	I will give your wealth, all your treasures, for spoil, 
JER.17.3	your high places, because of your sin, 
JER.17.3	throughout all your territories. 
JER.17.4	And you will let go your hand from your inheritance
JER.17.4	that I gave to you, 
JER.17.4	and I will make you serve your enemies 
JER.17.4	in the land that you do not know, 
JER.17.4	for you kindled a fire in my anger, 
JER.17.4	until eternity it will be kindled.” 
JER.17.5	Thus says Yahweh, 
JER.17.5	“Cursed is the person who trusts in humankind 
JER.17.5	and makes flesh his strength,
JER.17.5	and turns aside his heart from Yahweh. 
JER.17.6	And he will be like a juniper in the wilderness,
JER.17.6	and he will not see when good comes, 
JER.17.6	and he will dwell in the parched places in the desert,
JER.17.6	in a land of salt flats,
JER.17.7	Blessed be the person who trusts in Yahweh, 
JER.17.7	and Yahweh is his trust. 
JER.17.8	For he will be like a tree planted by water, 
JER.17.8	and to the stream it sends its roots, 
JER.17.8	and it will not fear when heat comes, 
JER.17.8	and its leaves
JER.17.8	and in the year of drought it will not be anxious, 
JER.17.8	and it will not cease from the bearing of fruit. 
JER.17.9	The heart is deceitful more than anything else, 
JER.17.9	and it is disastrous. Who can understand it? 
JER.17.10	I, Yahweh, examine the mind,
JER.17.10	I test the heart,
JER.17.10	and give to each one according to his way, 
JER.17.10	according to the fruit of his deeds. 
JER.17.11	Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay 
JER.17.11	is one who amasses wealth without justice. 
JER.17.11	In the middle of his days it will leave him, 
JER.17.11	and at his end he will prove to be a fool.” 
JER.17.12	A lofty throne of glory from the beginning 
JER.17.12	is the place of our sanctuary. 
JER.17.13	O Yahweh, the hope of Israel, 
JER.17.13	all those who forsake you will be put to shame, 
JER.17.13	and those who turn aside from you in the earth will be recorded, 
JER.17.13	for they have forsaken the fountain of living water, Yahweh. 
JER.17.14	Heal me, O Yahweh, and I will be healed, 
JER.17.14	save me, and I will be saved, 
JER.17.14	for you are my praise. 
JER.17.15	Look, they are saying to me, 
JER.17.15	“Where is the word of Yahweh? 
JER.17.15	Please let it come.” 
JER.17.16	But I, I have not run away from being a shepherd who follows you,
JER.17.16	and I have not desired the disastrous day. 
JER.17.16	You, you know the pronouncement of my lips, 
JER.17.16	it was before your face. 
JER.17.17	You must not become to me a terror, 
JER.17.17	you are my refuge in the day of disaster. 
JER.17.18	Let my persecutors be put to shame, 
JER.17.18	but as for me,
JER.17.18	Let them be dismayed, 
JER.17.18	but as for me,
JER.17.18	Bring on them the day of disaster, 
JER.17.18	and with double destruction, destroy them. 
JER.17.19	Thus said Yahweh to me, “Go, and you must stand in the People’s Gate
JER.17.20	And you must say to them, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem who enter through these gates. 
JER.17.21	Thus says Yahweh, “Be on your guard for the sake of yourselves, that you must not carry a burden on the day of the Sabbath, and you must not bring it
JER.17.22	And you must not carry a burden from your houses on the day of the Sabbath, and you must not do any work. But you must declare holy the day of Sabbath, just as I commanded your ancestors.
JER.17.23	Yet they did not listen, and they did not incline their ear, and they hardened their neck so as to not hear, nor to receive discipline. 
JER.17.24	“And it will happen, if you carefully listen to me,” declares
JER.17.25	then kings and officials who sit on the throne of David will enter through the gates of this city riding in chariots
JER.17.26	And they will come from the towns of Judah, and from all around Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the Shephelah, and from the hill country, and from the Negev, bringing burnt offerings,
JER.17.27	But if you do not listen to me, to declare holy the day of the Sabbath, and to not carry a burden and enter through the gates of Jerusalem on the day of the Sabbath, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it will not be quenched.” ’ ” 
JER.18.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
JER.18.2	“Stand up and go down to the house of the potter, and there I will let you hear my words.” 
JER.18.3	So I went down to the house of the potter and look, there he was doing work at the potter’s wheels. 
JER.18.4	And the vessel that he was making with the clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter, so he made again
JER.18.5	And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
JER.18.6	“Like this potter, am I not able to do to you, O house of Israel?” declares
JER.18.7	One moment I speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom, to uproot, and to tear down, and to destroy it.
JER.18.8	But if that nation turns back from its evil that I have threatened against it, then I will relent concerning the disaster that I planned to do to it. 
JER.18.9	And the next moment I speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom, to build, and to plant it.
JER.18.10	But if it does evil in my sight, to not listen to my voice, then I will relent concerning the good that I said I would do to it. 
JER.18.11	“So now then, say, please, to the people
JER.18.12	But they will say, ‘It is hopeless, for we will go after our own plans, and each one of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’ 
JER.18.13	“Therefore thus says Yahweh, 
JER.18.13	‘Please ask among the nations, “Who has heard the like of this?”
JER.18.13	The virgin of Israel has done something very horrible. 
JER.18.14	Does the snow of Lebanon leave from the crags
JER.18.14	Or are the cold waters flowing from distant mountains dried up? 
JER.18.15	But my people have forgotten me. 
JER.18.15	They make smoke offerings to the idols,
JER.18.15	and they caused them to stumble in their ways, the ancient ways, 
JER.18.15	to go into bypaths,
JER.18.16	To make their land a horror, 
JER.18.16	an object of whistling for eternity. 
JER.18.16	All who pass by it will be appalled, 
JER.18.16	and he will shake his head. 
JER.18.17	Like the wind from the east 
JER.18.17	I will scatter them before
JER.18.17	I will show them my back and not my face 
JER.18.17	in the day of their disaster.’ ” 
JER.18.18	Then they said, “Come and let us plan plans against Jeremiah, for instruction will not be lost from the priest, nor advice from the wise man, nor the word from the prophet. Come and let us bring charges against him,
JER.18.19	Listen attentively to me, O Yahweh, 
JER.18.19	and listen to the voice of my opponents. 
JER.18.20	Should good be repaid in place of evil? 
JER.18.20	Yet they have dug a pit for me. 
JER.18.20	Remember my standing before you
JER.18.20	to avert your wrath from them. 
JER.18.21	Therefore
JER.18.21	and hand them over to the power
JER.18.21	and let their wives be bereaved and widows, 
JER.18.21	and let their men be killed by death, 
JER.18.21	their young men struck dead 
JER.18.21	by the sword in the battle. 
JER.18.22	Let a cry for help be heard from their houses 
JER.18.22	when you suddenly bring upon them the raiding band, 
JER.18.22	for they have dug a pit to catch me, 
JER.18.22	and they have fixed secretly a trap for my feet. 
JER.18.23	But you, O Yahweh, you know 
JER.18.23	all their plans of assassination against me.
JER.18.23	You must not make atonement for their iniquity, 
JER.18.23	and you must not cause their sin to be blotted out from before you.
JER.18.23	But let them be overthrown before you.
JER.18.23	Deal with them in the time of your anger. 
JER.19.1	Thus said Yahweh, “Go and buy a potter’s earthenware jar, and take some of the elders of the people, and some of the leaders of the priests, 
JER.19.2	and go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom, which is at the entrance of the Gate of the Potsherd, and proclaim there the words that I speak to you. 
JER.19.3	And you shall say, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “Look, I am about to bring disaster upon this place so that everyone who hears it,
JER.19.4	Because they have forsaken me, and they have defaced this place, and they have made smoke offerings in it to other gods whom they have not known, they, nor their ancestors,
JER.19.5	and they have built the high places of Baal, to burn their children in the fire, burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, and I ordered not, and it did not come to my mind.
JER.19.6	“Therefore
JER.19.7	And I will lay waste the plans
JER.19.8	And I will make this city a horror, and an object of hissing, everyone who passes by it will be appalled, and will hiss because of all its wounds. 
JER.19.9	And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons, and the flesh of their daughters, and each one will eat the flesh of his neighbor in the siege and in the distress which their enemies and those who seek their life inflict on them.” ’ 
JER.19.10	“Then you shall break the jar before the eyes of the men who go with you. 
JER.19.11	And you shall say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts: “So I will break this people and this city as one breaks the vessel of the potter, so that it is not able to be repaired again. And in Topheth they will bury until there is no room to bury.
JER.19.12	Thus will I do to this place,” declares
JER.19.13	And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be unclean like the place of Topheth, all the houses where they made smoke offerings upon their roofs to all the host of heaven, and where they poured out libations to other gods.” ’ ” 
JER.19.14	Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the courtyard of the house of Yahweh and said to all the people, 
JER.19.15	“Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Look, I am about to bring to this city and upon all its towns all the disaster that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their neck to not hear my words.’ ” 
JER.20.1	Now Pashhur, the son of Immer, the priest who was officer in charge in the temple of Yahweh, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things. 
JER.20.2	Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the upper Gate of Benjamin, which was by the temple of Yahweh. 
JER.20.3	And then
JER.20.4	For thus says Yahweh, ‘Look, I am making you a terror to yourself and to all your friends, and they will fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes will be seeing it.
JER.20.5	And I will give all the wealth of this city, and all its acquisitions, and all its precious items, and all of the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give into the hand of their enemies, and they will plunder them, and they will seize them, and they will bring them to Babylon. 
JER.20.6	And you, Pashhur, and all those who live in your house will go into captivity, and you will go to Babylon, and there you will die, and there you will be buried, you, and all your friends to whom you have prophesied falsely.
JER.20.7	You have persuaded me, O Yahweh, and I was persuaded. 
JER.20.7	You have overpowered me, and you have prevailed. 
JER.20.7	I have become a laughingstock all day long. 
JER.20.7	Everyone
JER.20.8	For as often as
JER.20.8	I must cry out violence and destruction. 
JER.20.8	I must shout, for the word of Yahweh has become for me 
JER.20.8	a disgrace and derision all day long. 
JER.20.9	But if I say, “I will not mention him 
JER.20.9	and I will no longer speak in his name,” 
JER.20.9	then it becomes in my heart like a fire burning, 
JER.20.9	locked up in my bones, 
JER.20.9	and I struggle to contain it,
JER.20.9	and I am not able. 
JER.20.10	For I hear the rumor of many, 
JER.20.10	“Terror is from all around, denounce him,
JER.20.10	yes, let us denounce him!” 
JER.20.10	All my close friends
JER.20.10	saying, “perhaps he can be persuaded, 
JER.20.10	and we can prevail over him, 
JER.20.10	and we can take our revenge on him.” 
JER.20.11	But Yahweh is with me like a powerful warrior. 
JER.20.11	Therefore
JER.20.11	They will be very ashamed, for they will not achieve success. 
JER.20.11	Their everlasting insult
JER.20.12	Yet, O Yahweh of hosts, who tests the righteous, 
JER.20.12	who sees the heart
JER.20.12	let me see your retribution upon them, 
JER.20.12	for to you I have revealed my legal case. 
JER.20.13	Sing to Yahweh, praise Yahweh, 
JER.20.13	for he has delivered the life of the poor from the hand of evildoers. 
JER.20.14	Cursed be the day on which I was born, 
JER.20.14	let not the day on which my mother gave birth to me be blessed. 
JER.20.15	Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, 
JER.20.15	saying,
JER.20.15	and he made him very glad. 
JER.20.16	And let that man be like the cities 
JER.20.16	that Yahweh demolished without regret, 
JER.20.16	and let him hear a cry for help in the morning, 
JER.20.16	and an alarm at the time of noon. 
JER.20.17	Because he did not kill me in the womb, 
JER.20.17	so that my mother would have been for me my grave, 
JER.20.17	and her womb would be pregnant forever. 
JER.20.18	Why
JER.20.18	to see toil, and sorrow, and to end my days in shame?
JER.21.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur, the son of Malchiah, and Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying,
JER.21.2	“Please inquire of Yahweh on behalf of us, for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon is fighting against us. Perhaps Yahweh will do with us according to all his miraculous acts, so that he may go up from against us.” 
JER.21.3	Then Jeremiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to Zedekiah: 
JER.21.4	‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: “Look, I am about to turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands,
JER.21.5	And I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand, and with strong arm, and in anger,
JER.21.6	And I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both humankind and animal; by a great plague they will die. 
JER.21.7	And afterward,”
JER.21.8	“And to this people you shall say, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Look, I am setting before you
JER.21.9	He who stays in this city will die by the sword, or by the famine, or by the plague. And he who goes out and goes over to the Chaldeans who are laying siege to you will live, and his life will be to him as booty. 
JER.21.10	For I have set my face against this city for evil and not for good,” declares
JER.21.11	“And to the house of the king of Judah, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, 
JER.21.12	O house of David, thus says Yahweh, 
JER.21.12	“Execute judgment in the morning, justice, 
JER.21.12	and deliver the one who has been seized 
JER.21.12	from the hand of the oppressor, 
JER.21.12	lest my wrath goes forth like the fire and it burns, 
JER.21.12	and there is no one who quenches it
JER.21.12	because of the evil of your deeds. 
JER.21.13	Look, I am against you, 
JER.21.13	O inhabitants
JER.21.13	O rock of the plain,” declares
JER.21.13	“you who say, ‘Who can descend against us, 
JER.21.13	or who can enter into our hiding place?’ 
JER.21.14	And I will punish you 
JER.21.14	according to the fruit of your deeds,” declares
JER.21.14	“And I will kindle a fire in its forest, 
JER.21.14	and it will devour all its surroundings.” ’ ” 
JER.22.1	 Thus says Yahweh: “Go down to the house of the king of Judah and you must speak this word there. 
JER.22.2	And you must say, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people who enter through these gates. 
JER.22.3	Thus says Yahweh, “Act with justice and righteousness, and deliver the one who has been seized from the hand of the oppressor. And you must not oppress the immigrant, the orphan, and the widow. And you must not shed innocent blood in this place. 
JER.22.4	And if you indeed obey this word, then kings who sit for David on his throne will enter through the gates of this house, riding in chariots
JER.22.5	But if you do not obey these words, I swear by myself,” declares
JER.22.6	For thus says Yahweh concerning the house of the king of Judah, 
JER.22.6	“You are like Gilead to me, 
JER.22.6	like the head of the Lebanon. 
JER.22.6	Surely
JER.22.6	like cities that are not inhabited. 
JER.22.7	And I will consecrate against you destroyers, 
JER.22.7	everyone with his weapons, 
JER.22.7	and they will cut down your choicest cedars,
JER.22.7	and cast them
JER.22.8	And many nations will pass by this city and they will say each one to his neighbor, ‘Why
JER.22.9	Then they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God, and bowed down in worship to other gods, and served them.’ ” 
JER.22.10	You must not weep for the dead person, 
JER.22.10	and you must not show sympathy for him. 
JER.22.10	Weep bitterly for the one who goes away, 
JER.22.10	for he will not return, or see the land of his birth again. 
JER.22.11	For thus says Yahweh concerning Shallum, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, who reigned as king in place of Josiah his father, who went out from this place: “He will not return here again. 
JER.22.12	But in the place where they have deported him, there he will die, and he will not see this land again. 
JER.22.13	Woe to the one who builds his house without righteousness, 
JER.22.13	and his upper rooms without justice. 
JER.22.13	His fellow countryman, he works for nothing, 
JER.22.13	and he does not give to him his wages.
JER.22.14	Who says ‘I will build for myself 
JER.22.14	a spacious house with large upper rooms,’ 
JER.22.14	and he cuts windows for it, 
JER.22.14	and it is
JER.22.14	and he paints it
JER.22.15	Do you reign as king because you are competing in cedar? 
JER.22.15	Did not your father eat and drink, 
JER.22.15	and he did justice and righteousness, 
JER.22.15	then it was well with him? 
JER.22.16	He judged the legal cause of the needy and the poor, 
JER.22.16	and then it was well. 
JER.22.16	Is that not what it means to know me?
JER.22.17	“But there is nothing in your eyes and your heart 
JER.22.17	except
JER.22.17	and on shedding the blood of the innocent, 
JER.22.17	and on committing oppression and extortion.” 
JER.22.18	Therefore
JER.22.18	“They will not lament for him, 
JER.22.18	‘Alas, my brother,’ or ‘Alas, sister.’ 
JER.22.18	They will not lament for him, 
JER.22.18	‘Alas, lord,’ or ‘alas, his majesty.’ 
JER.22.19	He will be buried with the burial of a donkey. 
JER.22.19	He will be
JER.22.20	Go up to Lebanon and cry out, 
JER.22.20	and in Bashan lift up your voice, 
JER.22.20	and cry out from Abarim, 
JER.22.20	for all your lovers are shattered. 
JER.22.21	I spoke to you in the times you were secure,
JER.22.21	and you said, ‘I will not listen!’ 
JER.22.21	This was your way from your youth, 
JER.22.21	for you have not obeyed my voice. 
JER.22.22	All your shepherds will shepherd the wind, 
JER.22.22	and your lovers will go into captivity. 
JER.22.22	Yes, then you will be ashamed and humiliated 
JER.22.22	because of all your wickedness. 
JER.22.23	Inhabitants
JER.22.23	nestled among the cedars, 
JER.22.23	how you will groan when labor pains come to you, 
JER.22.23	fear and pain as the woman who gives birth. 
JER.22.24	“As I live,” declares
JER.22.25	And I would give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of those from whom you are frightened by their presence, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
JER.22.26	And I will throw you and your mother who gave birth to you to another country where you were not born, and there you will die. 
JER.22.27	As for the land to which they are longing
JER.22.28	Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered vessel? 
JER.22.28	Or a vessel in which there is no delight? 
JER.22.28	Why are he and his offspring thrown far, 
JER.22.28	and cast away to the land that they do not know?” 
JER.22.29	O land, land, land, hear the word of Yahweh. 
JER.22.30	Thus says Yahweh: 
JER.22.30	“Record this man as childless, 
JER.22.30	a man who will not succeed in his days, 
JER.22.30	for no man from his offspring will succeed him,
JER.22.30	sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah.” 
JER.23.1	“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the flock of my pasture,” declares
JER.23.2	Therefore
JER.23.3	“Then I myself will gather together the remnant of my flock from all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their grazing place, and they will be fruitful, and they will become numerous. 
JER.23.4	And I will raise up over them shepherds, and they will shepherd them, and they will no longer fear, and they will not be dismayed, and they will not be missing,” declares
JER.23.5	“Look, days are coming,” declares
JER.23.5	“when I will raise up for David a righteous branch, 
JER.23.5	and he will reign as king, and he will achieve success, 
JER.23.5	and he will do justice and righteousness in the land. 
JER.23.6	In his days Judah will be saved, 
JER.23.6	and Israel will dwell in safety,
JER.23.6	and this is his name by which he will be called: 
JER.23.6	‘Yahweh is our righteousness.’ 
JER.23.7	“Therefore
JER.23.8	but ‘As Yahweh lives,
JER.23.9	Concerning the prophets: 
JER.23.9	My heart is broken in my midst. 
JER.23.9	All my bones tremble. 
JER.23.9	I have become like a drunken man, 
JER.23.9	even like a man over whom wine has passed, 
JER.23.9	because of Yahweh, 
JER.23.9	and because of his holy words.
JER.23.10	For the land is full of adulterers; 
JER.23.10	for the land mourns because of a curse. 
JER.23.10	The pastures of the desert
JER.23.10	and their evil has been their way of running, 
JER.23.10	and their power is not right. 
JER.23.11	“For both prophet as well as priest are godless, 
JER.23.11	even in my temple I have found their wickedness,” declares
JER.23.12	“Therefore
JER.23.12	they will be pushed in the darkness, 
JER.23.12	and they will fall into it, 
JER.23.12	for I will bring disaster on them in the year of their punishment,” declares
JER.23.13	“Now in the prophets of Samaria I saw a disgusting thing. 
JER.23.13	They prophesied by Baal and they caused my people Israel to err. 
JER.23.14	And in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen something horrible. 
JER.23.14	They commit adultery, and they walk in lies,
JER.23.14	and they make strong the hands of evildoers, 
JER.23.14	so that they have not turned back each from his wickedness. 
JER.23.14	All of them have become to me like Sodom, 
JER.23.14	and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.” 
JER.23.15	Therefore
JER.23.15	“Look, I am going to let them eat wormwood 
JER.23.15	and I will give them water of poison to drink, 
JER.23.15	for from the prophets of Jerusalem 
JER.23.15	went out ungodliness to all the land.” 
JER.23.16	Thus says Yahweh of hosts, 
JER.23.16	“You must not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. 
JER.23.16	They are deluding you with visions of their mind,
JER.23.16	They do not speak from the mouth of Yahweh. 
JER.23.17	They are
JER.23.17	‘Peace it will be to you,’ 
JER.23.17	and to each one
JER.23.17	‘Calamity will not come upon you.’ 
JER.23.18	For who has stood in the council of Yahweh, 
JER.23.18	that he has seen and heard his word? 
JER.23.18	Who has listened attentively to his word 
JER.23.18	and heard it?
JER.23.19	Look, the storm of Yahweh has gone forth in wrath, 
JER.23.19	even a whirling tempest. 
JER.23.19	It will whirl upon the head of the wicked. 
JER.23.20	The anger
JER.23.20	until his doing and until his keeping the plans of his mind.
JER.23.20	In latter days
JER.23.21	I have not sent the prophets, yet they ran. 
JER.23.21	I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. 
JER.23.22	But if they had stood in my council, 
JER.23.22	then they would have proclaimed my words to my people, 
JER.23.22	and they would have caused them to turn from their evil way, 
JER.23.22	and from the evil of their deeds. 
JER.23.23	Am I a God from near,” declares
JER.23.23	“and not a God from far? 
JER.23.24	Or can a person hide himself in secret places 
JER.23.24	and I cannot see him?” declares
JER.23.24	“Do I not fill up the heaven and the earth?” declares
JER.23.25	“I have heard what the prophets who prophesy lies
JER.23.26	How long
JER.23.27	who plan to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell each one to his neighbor, just as their ancestors
JER.23.28	The prophet who has with him a dream, let him tell the dream. But the prophet
JER.23.29	“Is not my word like fire?” declares
JER.23.30	“Therefore
JER.23.31	Look, I am against the prophets,” declares
JER.23.32	Look, I am against those who prophesy dreams of lies,”
JER.23.33	“Now when this people, or a prophet, or a priest, ask you, saying,
JER.23.34	“And the prophet, and the priest, and the people who say, ‘The burden
JER.23.35	Thus you shall say, each one to his neighbor and each one to his brother: ‘What has Yahweh answered?’ or, ‘What has Yahweh spoken?’ 
JER.23.36	But you shall not mention the burden
JER.23.37	Thus you shall say to that prophet, ‘What has Yahweh answered you?’ or, ‘What has Yahweh spoken?’ 
JER.23.38	But if you say, ‘The burden
JER.23.39	Therefore
JER.23.40	and I will bring upon you an everlasting disgrace
JER.24.1	Yahweh showed me, and look, there were two baskets of figs placed before
JER.24.2	The one basket had very good figs, like early figs,
JER.24.3	And Yahweh asked me, “What are you seeing, Jeremiah?” And I said, “Figs—the good figs, very good, and the bad figs, very bad, that cannot be eaten because of their bad quality.” 
JER.24.4	Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
JER.24.5	“Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles
JER.24.6	For I will set my eyes
JER.24.7	And I will give to them a heart to know me, that I am Yahweh, and they will be my people,
JER.24.8	But like the bad figs that cannot be eaten because of their bad quality—for thus says Yahweh—so I will treat Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who live in the land of Egypt. 
JER.24.9	And I will make them as a terror, an evil to all the kingdoms of the earth, as a disgrace and a proverb, as a taunt and a curse, in all the places where I will drive them. 
JER.24.10	And I will send among them the sword, the famine, and the plague, until they perish from the land that I gave to them and their ancestors.’ ”
JER.25.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, 
JER.25.2	which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
JER.25.3	“From the thirteenth year of Josiah, the son of Amon, the king of Judah, even up to this day, these twenty-three years
JER.25.4	And though Yahweh has sent all his servants the prophets to you over and over again
JER.25.5	saying,
JER.25.6	and you must not go after other gods to serve them, and to bow in worship to them, and you must not provoke me to anger with the work of your hands, then I will not do something bad to you.’ 
JER.25.7	‘Yet you have not listened to me,’ declares
JER.25.8	Therefore
JER.25.9	look, I am going to send and take all the clans
JER.25.10	And I will exterminate from them the sound of jubilation, and the sound of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp. 
JER.25.11	And all this land will become a site of ruins, a desolation, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
JER.25.12	And then
JER.25.13	And I will bring upon that land all my words that I have spoken against it, everything that is written in this scroll which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations. 
JER.25.14	For many nations and great kings will let them work, even them, and I will repay them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.’ ” 
JER.25.15	For thus said Yahweh, the God of Israel, to me, “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from my hand, and you must give it to all the nations to whom I am sending you to drink. 
JER.25.16	And they will drink, and they will stagger, and they will act like madmen because of the presence
JER.25.17	So I took the cup from the hand of Yahweh and I gave it
JER.25.18	Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, and its kings, and its officials, to make them a site of ruins, a horror, an object of hissing, and a curse, as it is this day; 
JER.25.19	Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and his servants, and his officials, and all his people; 
JER.25.20	and all the other
JER.25.21	Edom, and Moab, and the Ammonites;
JER.25.22	and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastland that is across the sea; 
JER.25.23	and Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all those who are trimmed to the side; 
JER.25.24	and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the other
JER.25.25	and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media; 
JER.25.26	and all the kings of the north, near and far, each one to his brother, and all the kingdoms of the world that are on the face of the earth; and the king of Sheshach, he will drink after them. 
JER.25.27	“And you shall say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “Drink and become drunk, and vomit, and fall, and you must not rise because of the presence
JER.25.28	And it will happen, if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, “You must certainly drink! 
JER.25.29	For look, on the city that is called by
JER.25.30	And you yourself shall prophesy against them all these words, and you shall say to them: 
JER.25.30	‘Yahweh will roar from on high, 
JER.25.30	and from his holy dwelling place
JER.25.30	He will roar mightily against his settlement, 
JER.25.30	a jubilant shout like those who tread grapes, 
JER.25.30	he will answer against all the inhabitants of the earth. 
JER.25.31	The rage of battle will resound to the end of the earth, 
JER.25.31	for there is a lawsuit of Yahweh against the nations. 
JER.25.31	He is entering into judgment with all wicked flesh, 
JER.25.31	he will give them to the sword,’ declares
JER.25.32	Thus says Yahweh of hosts, 
JER.25.32	“Look, disaster is going out from nation to nation, 
JER.25.32	and a great tempest is stirred up from the farthest parts of the earth. 
JER.25.33	And the slain ones of Yahweh will be on that day 
JER.25.33	from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth, 
JER.25.33	and they will not be mourned, 
JER.25.33	and they will not be gathered, 
JER.25.33	and they will not be buried. 
JER.25.33	They will become like dung on the surface
JER.25.34	Wail, you shepherds, and cry out. 
JER.25.34	And roll about in mourning in the dust, O leaders
JER.25.34	For your days of slaughter and your dispersions have arrived, 
JER.25.34	and you will fall like a vessel of desire. 
JER.25.35	And flight will perish from the shepherds, 
JER.25.35	and escape from the leaders
JER.25.36	A sound, the cry of distress of the shepherds 
JER.25.36	and the wailing of the leaders
JER.25.36	for Yahweh is despoiling their pasture. 
JER.25.37	And the peaceful settlements
JER.25.37	because of the burning anger of Yahweh.
JER.25.38	He has left his den like a lion, 
JER.25.38	for their land has become a horror, 
JER.25.38	because of the anger of the oppressors, 
JER.25.38	and because of his burning anger.”
JER.26.1	At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, this word came from Yahweh, saying,
JER.26.2	“Thus says Yahweh: ‘Stand in the courtyard of the house of Yahweh, and you must speak to all the cities of Judah that come to bow in worship in the house of Yahweh all the words that I command you to speak to them. You must not omit a word. 
JER.26.3	Perhaps they will listen and turn back each from his evil way, and I will relent of the disaster that I am planning to do to them because of their evil deeds. 
JER.26.4	And you shall say to them, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set
JER.26.5	to listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I have sent to you, over and over again,
JER.26.6	then I will make this house like Shiloh, and this city I will make a curse for all the nations of the earth.’ ” ’ ” 
JER.26.7	And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the temple of Yahweh. 
JER.26.8	And then
JER.26.9	Why have you prophesied in the name of Yahweh, saying,
JER.26.10	When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the house of the king to the temple of Yahweh, and they sat in the entrance of the New Gate of Yahweh’s temple. 
JER.26.11	Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the people, saying,
JER.26.12	Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and to all the people, saying,
JER.26.13	Now therefore
JER.26.14	But as for me, look, I am in your hand, do to me what is good and right in your eyes. 
JER.26.15	Only you must certainly know that if you put me to death, you will bring on yourselves innocent blood, and on this city and on its inhabitants, for truly
JER.26.16	Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, “This man does not deserve
JER.26.17	Then men from the elders of the land arose and said to all the assembly of the people, saying,
JER.26.18	“Micah the Morashtite was prophesying in the days of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and he said to all the people of Judah, saying:
JER.26.18	‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, 
JER.26.18	“Zion will be plowed, 
JER.26.18	and Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, 
JER.26.18	and the mountain of the temple
JER.26.19	Did Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and all Judah actually put him to death? Was he not in fear of Yahweh? And he entreated the face of Yahweh, and Yahweh relented of the disaster that he had spoken against them. But we are about to do great disaster to ourselves.” 
JER.26.20	Indeed, there also was a man prophesying in the name of Yahweh, Uriah, the son of Shemaiah, from Kiriath-Jearim, and he prophesied against this city and against this land like all the words of Jeremiah. 
JER.26.21	And when King Jehoiakim, and all his warriors, and all the officials heard his words, then the king sought to put him to death. But Uriah heard, and he was afraid, and he fled and went to Egypt. 
JER.26.22	Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt. Elnathan, the son of Achbor, and men with him went to Egypt. 
JER.26.23	And they brought out Uriah from Egypt and they brought him to King Jehoiakim, and he struck him down with the sword, and he threw his dead body into the burial sites of the sons of the people. 
JER.26.24	However, the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not given into the hand of the people to put him to death. 
JER.27.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying
JER.27.2	thus said Yahweh to me—“Make for yourself fetters and yokes and put them on your neck, 
JER.27.3	and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites,
JER.27.4	And you must command them for their masters, saying,
JER.27.5	“I have made the earth with humankind and animals
JER.27.6	And now I myself have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and also the animals
JER.27.7	And all the nations will serve him, and his son, and his grandson,
JER.27.8	“But it will be that the nation or kingdom that will not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put his neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, and with the famine, and with the plague,” declares
JER.27.9	And you, you must not listen to your prophets, and to your diviners, and to your dreamers, and to your interpreters of signs, and to your sorcerers who are saying,
JER.27.10	For they are prophesying to you a lie, so that you will be removed from your land, and I will drive you away, and you will perish. 
JER.27.11	But the nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and will serve him, yet will I leave it on its land,” declares
JER.27.12	And I spoke words like these to Zedekiah, the king of Judah, saying,
JER.27.13	Why should you die—you and your people—by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? 
JER.27.14	And you must not listen to the words of the prophets who are speaking to you, saying,
JER.27.15	For I have not sent them,” declares
JER.27.16	Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying,
JER.27.17	And you must not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city become a site of ruins? 
JER.27.18	But if they are prophets, and if there is with them the word of Yahweh, let them please plead with Yahweh of hosts, that the vessels that are left over in the temple
JER.27.19	For thus says Yahweh of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the stands, and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city, 
JER.27.20	which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, did not take when he deported Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with
JER.27.21	For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Yahweh, and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem: 
JER.27.22	‘They will be brought to Babylon, and there they will stay until the day of my attending to them,’ declares
JER.28.1	And it was in that same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah, the son of Azzur, the prophet who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of Yahweh before the eyes of the priests and all the people, saying,
JER.28.2	“Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,
JER.28.3	Within two years
JER.28.4	And Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and all the exiles
JER.28.5	Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet before the eyes of the priests and before the eyes of all the people who were standing in the house of Yahweh, 
JER.28.6	and Jeremiah the prophet said, “Amen! May Yahweh do so; may Yahweh fulfill your words that you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the house of Yahweh and all the exiles
JER.28.7	Nevertheless listen please to this word that I am speaking in your hearing
JER.28.8	The prophets who were before
JER.28.9	The prophet who prophesies peace, at the coming of the word of the prophet, will become known as the prophet that Yahweh has truly
JER.28.10	Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it. 
JER.28.11	Then Hananiah said before the eyes of all the people, saying,
JER.28.12	And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet broke the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
JER.28.13	“Go, and you must say to Hananiah, saying,
JER.28.14	For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, to serve Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and they will serve him, and I have even given the animals
JER.28.15	Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, “Please listen, Hananiah, Yahweh has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie. 
JER.28.16	Therefore
JER.28.17	And Hananiah the prophet died in that same year in the seventh month. 
JER.29.1	And these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remainder of the exiles,
JER.29.2	after the going out of Jeconiah the king, and the queen mother, and the court officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, and the artisans,
JER.29.3	by the hand of Elasah, the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah, the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah, the king of Judah, sent to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, to Babylon, saying,
JER.29.4	“Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles
JER.29.5	‘Build houses and live in them,
JER.29.6	Take wives and father sons and daughters, and take for your sons wives, and give your daughters to men that they may bear sons and daughters, and multiply there, and you must not be few. 
JER.29.7	And seek the prosperity of the city where I have deported you, and pray on behalf of it to Yahweh, for in its prosperity you will have prosperity.’ 
JER.29.8	For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Do not let your prophets who are in your midst, and your diviners, deceive you, and you must not listen to your dreams that you are causing them to dream. 
JER.29.9	For they are prophesying falsely
JER.29.10	For thus says Yahweh, ‘As soon as the time has passed,
JER.29.11	For I know the plans that I am planning concerning you,’ declares
JER.29.12	Then when you call me, and you come and pray to me, then I will listen to you. 
JER.29.13	When you search for me, then you will find me, if you seek me with all your heart. 
JER.29.14	And I will let myself be found by you,’ declares
JER.29.15	Because you have said, ‘Yahweh has raised up prophets for us in Babylon’— 
JER.29.16	for thus says Yahweh concerning the king who sits on the throne of David and concerning all the people who live in this city, your fellow kinsmen who did not go with you into the exile— 
JER.29.17	thus says Yahweh of hosts, ‘Look, I am going to send among them the sword, the famine, and the plague, and I will make them like rotten figs that cannot be eaten because of their bad quality. 
JER.29.18	And I will pursue them with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague, and I will make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse, and a horror, and an object of hissing, and a disgrace among all the nations to which I have driven them, 
JER.29.19	because they did not listen to my words,’ declares
JER.29.20	And you, hear the word of Yahweh, all you exiles
JER.29.21	Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab, the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah, the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you in my name a lie, ‘Look, I am going to give them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and he will strike them before your eyes. 
JER.29.22	And a curse will be taken up because of them by all the exiles
JER.29.23	because they have done a disgraceful thing in Israel, and they have committed adultery with the wives of their neighbors, and they have spoken words
JER.29.24	And to Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall say, saying,
JER.29.25	“Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,
JER.29.26	“Yahweh made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, so that there are overseers in the house of Yahweh over any mad man who exhibits the behavior of a prophet, and you must put him into the stocks and into the neck iron, 
JER.29.27	and so then why have you not rebuked Jeremiah the Anathothite who exhibits the behavior of a prophet for you? 
JER.29.28	Because
JER.29.29	And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing
JER.29.30	And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,
JER.29.31	“Send to all the exiles,
JER.29.32	therefore
JER.30.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
JER.30.2	“Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying,
JER.30.3	For look, days are coming,’ declares
JER.30.4	Now these are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah. 
JER.30.5	“For thus says Yahweh: 
JER.30.5	‘We have heard a sound of trembling, 
JER.30.5	terror, and there is no peace. 
JER.30.6	Ask please and see whether a male can bear a child. 
JER.30.6	Why do I see every strong man 
JER.30.6	with his hands on his loins like a woman giving birth? 
JER.30.6	And why are all their faces changed to paleness? 
JER.30.7	Alas! For that day is great, 
JER.30.7	there is none like it.
JER.30.7	And it is a time of distress for Jacob, 
JER.30.7	yet from it he will be delivered. 
JER.30.8	And it will happen on that day,’ declares
JER.30.8	‘I will break his yoke from your neck 
JER.30.8	and your bonds I will tear to pieces. 
JER.30.8	And strangers will no longer let him work as a slave. 
JER.30.9	But they will serve Yahweh their God, 
JER.30.9	and David their king, whom I will raise up for them. 
JER.30.10	But you must not fear, my servant Jacob,’ declares
JER.30.10	‘and you must not be dismayed, Israel, 
JER.30.10	for look, I am going to save you from far, 
JER.30.10	and your offspring from the land of their captivity. 
JER.30.10	And Jacob will return, 
JER.30.10	and he will be at rest, 
JER.30.10	and he will be at ease, 
JER.30.10	and there will be no one who makes him
JER.30.11	For I am with you,’ declares
JER.30.11	For I will make a complete destruction 
JER.30.11	of all the nations to which I scattered you, 
JER.30.11	but you I will not make a complete destruction. 
JER.30.11	And I will chastise you to the measure, 
JER.30.11	and I will not leave you entirely unpunished.’ 
JER.30.12	For thus says Yahweh, 
JER.30.12	‘Your injury is incurable, 
JER.30.12	your wound is overcome by sickness. 
JER.30.13	There is no one who pleads your cause, 
JER.30.13	for your boil there is no healing for you. 
JER.30.14	All your lovers have forgotten you, 
JER.30.14	they do not care for you. 
JER.30.14	I have struck you with the blow of an enemy, 
JER.30.14	the punishment of the cruel, 
JER.30.14	because of the greatness of your guilt, 
JER.30.14	your sins are numerous. 
JER.30.15	Why do you cry because of your wound? 
JER.30.15	Your pain is incurable. 
JER.30.15	Because of the greatness of your guilt—your sins are vast— 
JER.30.15	I have done these things to you. 
JER.30.16	Therefore
JER.30.16	and all your foes, all of them will go into captivity, 
JER.30.16	and those who plunder you will be as plunder, 
JER.30.16	and all those who plunder you I will make as plunder. 
JER.30.17	For I will present healing to you, 
JER.30.17	and I will heal you of your wounds,’ declares
JER.30.17	‘Because they have called you an outcast, saying, 
JER.30.17	“It is Zion, there is no one who cares for her.” ’ 
JER.30.18	Thus says Yahweh: 
JER.30.18	‘Look, I will restore the fortunes
JER.30.18	and I will have compassion on his dwellings, 
JER.30.18	and the city will be rebuilt upon its mound, 
JER.30.18	and the citadel fortress will stand on its rightful site. 
JER.30.19	And thanksgiving and the sound of merrymakers 
JER.30.19	will come out from them, 
JER.30.19	and I will make them numerous, 
JER.30.19	and they will not be few. 
JER.30.19	And I will make them honored, 
JER.30.19	and they will not be lowly. 
JER.30.20	And their children will be as of old, 
JER.30.20	and their community will be established before me.
JER.30.20	And I will punish all their oppressors. 
JER.30.21	And their noble will be from them, 
JER.30.21	and their ruler will come out from their midst. 
JER.30.21	And I will bring him near and he will approach me. 
JER.30.21	For who is he that would pledge his heart to approach me?’ declares
JER.30.22	‘And you will be to me a people, 
JER.30.22	and I will be to you God.’ ” 
JER.30.23	Look, the storm of Yahweh! 
JER.30.23	Wrath has gone forth, 
JER.30.23	a whirling tempest. 
JER.30.23	It will whirl upon the head of the wicked. 
JER.30.24	The burning anger of Yahweh
JER.30.24	and until his accomplishing the plans of his mind.
JER.30.24	In the last of the days you will understand it. 
JER.31.1	 “At that time,” declares
JER.31.1	“I will be the God of all the clans
JER.31.1	and they will be to me a people.” 
JER.31.2	Thus says Yahweh: 
JER.31.2	“The people of the survivors of the sword found grace in the desert;
JER.31.2	Israel going to find their rest.” 
JER.31.3	From afar Yahweh appeared to me, saying, 
JER.31.3	“I have loved you with an everlasting love. 
JER.31.3	Therefore
JER.31.4	I will again build you, 
JER.31.4	and you will be built, O virgin Israel. 
JER.31.4	You will again adorn yourself with your tambourines, 
JER.31.4	and you will go forth in the dancing in a ring of the merrymakers. 
JER.31.5	You will again plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria. 
JER.31.5	The planters will plant, and they will enjoy it.
JER.31.6	For there will be a day when watchmen will call in the hill country of Ephraim, 
JER.31.6	‘Stand up, and let us go up to Zion, to Yahweh our God.’ ” 
JER.31.7	For thus says Yahweh, 
JER.31.7	“Sing for joy for Jacob with gladness, 
JER.31.7	and shout out for the head of the nations. 
JER.31.7	Proclaim, praise, and say, 
JER.31.7	‘Save, O Yahweh, your people, the remnant of Israel.’ 
JER.31.8	Look, I am going to bring them from the land of the north, 
JER.31.8	and I will gather them from the remotest part of the earth. 
JER.31.8	Among them the blind, and the lame, 
JER.31.8	those who are pregnant, and those who give birth, 
JER.31.8	together, a great assembly, 
JER.31.8	they will return here. 
JER.31.9	With weeping they will come, 
JER.31.9	and with pleas for mercy I will bring them; 
JER.31.9	I will let them walk by streams of water in a straight path. 
JER.31.9	They will not stumble in it, 
JER.31.9	for I have become to Israel a father, 
JER.31.9	and Ephraim, he is my firstborn.” 
JER.31.10	Hear the word of Yahweh, O nations, 
JER.31.10	and declare in the coastlands from afar, and say, 
JER.31.10	“The scatterer of Israel will gather him, 
JER.31.10	and he will keep him as a shepherd his flock. 
JER.31.11	For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob, 
JER.31.11	and he has redeemed him from the hand of the person stronger
JER.31.12	And they will come, 
JER.31.12	and they will sing for joy on the height of Zion, 
JER.31.12	and they will be radiant over the goodness of Yahweh, 
JER.31.12	over the grain, and over the wine, and over the olive oil, 
JER.31.12	and over the young ones of the flock, and over the cattle. 
JER.31.12	And their life will become like a well-watered garden, 
JER.31.12	and they will never languish again.” 
JER.31.13	“Then the young woman will rejoice in the dancing in a ring, 
JER.31.13	and the young men and the old men together. 
JER.31.13	And I will turn their mourning to jubilation, 
JER.31.13	and I will comfort them, 
JER.31.13	and I will gladden them from their sorrow. 
JER.31.14	And I will saturate the appetite of the priests with fatness, 
JER.31.14	and my people will be satisfied with my goodness,” declares
JER.31.15	Thus says Yahweh, 
JER.31.15	“A voice is heard in Ramah, 
JER.31.15	lamentation, the weeping of bitterness. 
JER.31.15	Rachel is weeping for her children; 
JER.31.15	she refuses to be comforted because of her children, 
JER.31.15	for they are no more.” 
JER.31.16	Thus says Yahweh: 
JER.31.16	“Restrain your voice from weeping, 
JER.31.16	and your eyes from tears, 
JER.31.16	for there is a reward for your work,” declares
JER.31.16	“and they will return from the land of the enemy. 
JER.31.17	And there is hope for your future,” declares
JER.31.17	“and your children will return to their territory. 
JER.31.18	Indeed I heard Ephraim pitying themselves, 
JER.31.18	‘You disciplined me, and I was disciplined, 
JER.31.18	like a calf that is not trained. 
JER.31.18	Bring me back and let me return, 
JER.31.18	for you are Yahweh my God. 
JER.31.19	For after my turning back I repented, 
JER.31.19	and after coming to understand I struck my thigh. 
JER.31.19	I was ashamed and also humiliated, 
JER.31.19	because I bore the disgrace of my youth.’ 
JER.31.20	Is Ephraim my dear son, 
JER.31.20	or the child of my delight? 
JER.31.20	For as often as
JER.31.20	I still remember him. 
JER.31.20	Therefore
JER.31.20	surely I will have compassion on him,” declares
JER.31.21	“Set up for yourself road markers, 
JER.31.21	make for yourself signposts, 
JER.31.21	set your mind
JER.31.21	the road by which you went. 
JER.31.21	Return, O virgin of Israel, 
JER.31.21	return to these your cities. 
JER.31.22	How long
JER.31.22	For Yahweh has created a new thing on the earth, 
JER.31.22	a woman, she shelters a man.” 
JER.31.23	Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “They will again say these words
JER.31.23	‘Yahweh bless you, O settlement of righteousness, 
JER.31.23	O hill of holiness.’ 
JER.31.24	And Judah and all of its towns together will live in it, 
JER.31.24	farmers and those who travel with the flocks.
JER.31.25	For I will saturate the thirst of the weary, 
JER.31.25	and every person who languishes I will replenish.” 
JER.31.26	At this I awoke and looked, 
JER.31.26	and my sleep was pleasant to me. 
JER.31.27	“Look, the days are coming,” declares
JER.31.28	And then
JER.31.29	“In those days they will say no longer, ‘Parents
JER.31.30	But
JER.31.31	Look, the days are coming,” declares
JER.31.32	not like the covenant that I made
JER.31.33	“But this is the covenant that I will make
JER.31.34	And they will no longer teach each one his neighbor, or each one his brother, saying,
JER.31.35	Thus says Yahweh, who gives the sun for light by day, the regulations of the moon and the stars for light by night, who stirs up the sea and its waves roar—Yahweh of hosts is his name. 
JER.31.36	“If these rules would cease from before me,”
JER.31.37	Thus says Yahweh, “If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be explored, also I will reject all the offspring of Israel because of all that they have done,” declares
JER.31.38	“Look, days are coming,” declares
JER.31.39	And the measuring line
JER.31.40	And the whole of the valley of the corpses, and the ashes, and all the cultivated fields up to the wadi of Kidron, up to the corner of the Gate of the Horses toward the east will be holy to Yahweh. It will not be uprooted, and it will not be overthrown again forever.”
JER.32.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah the king of Judah, that was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. 
JER.32.2	Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon was laying siege to Jerusalem and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah, 
JER.32.3	where Zedekiah, the king of Judah, had confined him, saying,
JER.32.4	and Zedekiah, the king of Judah, will not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but surely he will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will speak face to face with him
JER.32.5	and to Babylon he will bring Zedekiah, and there he will be until my attending to him,” declares
JER.32.6	And Jeremiah said, “The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
JER.32.7	‘Look, Hanamel, the son of Shallum, your uncle, is going to come to you, saying,
JER.32.8	Then Hanamel, the son of my uncle, came to me, to the courtyard of the guard according to
JER.32.9	And I bought the field from Hanamel, the son of my uncle, that was at Anathoth. And I weighed out to him the money, seventeen silver shekels. 
JER.32.10	And I signed on the letter
JER.32.11	Then I took the deed
JER.32.12	And I gave the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of
JER.32.13	And I commanded Baruch in their presence,
JER.32.14	‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “Take these deeds,
JER.32.15	For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.” ’ 
JER.32.16	And I prayed to Yahweh—after giving my deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah—saying,
JER.32.17	‘Ah Lord Yahweh! Look, you made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm. Nothing
JER.32.18	showing loyal love to the thousands, and repaying the guilt of parents
JER.32.19	great in counsel and great in deed, whose eyes are opened to all the ways of the children of humankind, to give to each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds, 
JER.32.20	who accomplished signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, up to this day, and in Israel, and among humankind, and you have made for yourself a name, as it is this day. 
JER.32.21	And you brought out your people Israel from the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an arm stretched out, and with great terror. 
JER.32.22	And you gave to them this land, which you swore to their ancestors
JER.32.23	And they entered and took possession of it, but they did not listen to your voice, and they did not follow your law. They did nothing of all that you commanded to them to do, and you caused to happen to them all this disaster. 
JER.32.24	Look, the siege ramps have come up to the city to capture it, and the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it, because of the sword, the famine, and the plague, and what you spoke happened, and look, you are seeing it.
JER.32.25	Yet you have said to me, Lord Yahweh, “Buy for yourself the field with the money, and call witnesses as witness,” though the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ ” 
JER.32.26	And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,
JER.32.27	“Look, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh; is anything
JER.32.28	Therefore
JER.32.29	And the Chaldeans, who are fighting against this city, will come and set this city on fire, and they will burn it, and the houses where they have made smoke offerings on their roofs to Baal, and where they have devoted libations to other gods, in order to provoke me to anger. 
JER.32.30	For the people
JER.32.31	“For this city has been for me a cause of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even until this day, so I will remove it from my sight,
JER.32.32	because of all the evil of the people
JER.32.33	And they have turned to me their backs
JER.32.34	And they set up their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it. 
JER.32.35	And they built the high places of Baal that are in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to present as offerings their sons and their daughters to Molech, which I had not commanded them, and it had not come to my mind
JER.32.36	“So now therefore,
JER.32.37	Look, I am going to gather them from all the lands to which I driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath, and I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell in safety.
JER.32.38	And they will be for me a people, and I will be for them God. 
JER.32.39	And I will give to them one heart and one way, to revere me forever,
JER.32.40	And I will make
JER.32.41	And I will rejoice over them to do good to them, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness with all my heart, and with all my inner self.”
JER.32.42	“For thus says Yahweh, ‘Just as I have brought to this people all this great disaster, so I will bring upon them all the good that I promise to them. 
JER.32.43	And the fields
JER.32.44	They will buy fields with money, and they will sign the deeds,
JER.33.1	And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah a second time while he was still held back in the courtyard of the guard, saying,
JER.33.2	“Thus says Yahweh who made the earth,
JER.33.3	‘Call to me, and I will answer you, and I will tell you great things and inaccessible things that you have not known.’ 
JER.33.4	For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, that were torn down to make a defense against the siege ramps and against the sword: 
JER.33.5	‘They are coming to fight against the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the corpses of the people whom I will strike in my anger and in my wrath, for whom I have hidden my face from this city because of all their wickedness. 
JER.33.6	Look, I am going to bring healing and health to it, and I will heal them, and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and reliability. 
JER.33.7	And I will restore the fortunes
JER.33.8	And I will cleanse them from all their guilt that they sinned against me, and I will forgive all their iniquities that they sinned against me, and that they rebelled against me. 
JER.33.9	And it will be to me a name of jubilation, a praise, and a glory before all the nations of the earth, who will hear all the good that I will do for them, and they will fear,
JER.33.10	“Thus says Yahweh: ‘Again will be heard in this place, of which you are saying, “It is a waste, without
JER.33.11	the voice of jubilation, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voices
JER.33.12	Thus says Yahweh of hosts: ‘Again there will be in this waste place, without
JER.33.13	In the towns of the hill country, in the towns of the Shephelah, and in the towns of the Negev, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the surroundings of Jerusalem, and in the towns of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hands of the counter,’ says Yahweh. 
JER.33.14	‘Look, days are coming,’ declares
JER.33.15	In those days and in that time I will make a branch of righteousness sprout for David, and he will execute justice and righteousness in the land. 
JER.33.16	In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell safely,
JER.33.17	For thus says Yahweh: ‘A man who sits on the throne of the house of Israel will not be cut off for David. 
JER.33.18	And for the priests, a man from the Levites who offers burnt offerings
JER.33.19	And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,
JER.33.20	“Thus says Yahweh: ‘If you could break my covenant with the day, and my covenant with the night, so that day and night would not come at their time, 
JER.33.21	then my covenant could be broken with David my servant, from having
JER.33.22	As the host of heaven cannot be counted, and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will make numerous the offspring of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.’ ” 
JER.33.23	And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,
JER.33.24	“Have you not seen how these people speak, saying,
JER.33.25	Thus says Yahweh: ‘If my covenant with day and with night, the regulations of heaven and earth, I had not established, 
JER.33.26	then the offspring of Jacob and David my servant I would reject, from choosing rulers from his offspring over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will restore their fortunes
JER.34.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and all his army, with all the kingdoms of the earth under the dominion of his hand, and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying,
JER.34.2	“Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Go and say to Zedekiah the king of Judah, now you must say to him, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Look, I am going to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire. 
JER.34.3	And you will not escape from his hand, but surely you will be captured, and into his hand you will be given, and you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye,
JER.34.4	However, hear the word of Yahweh, O Zedekiah, the king of Judah. Thus says Yahweh concerning you: ‘You will not die by the sword. 
JER.34.5	In peace you will die, and as there was burning for your ancestors,
JER.34.6	Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Zedekiah the king of Judah all these words in Jerusalem 
JER.34.7	when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left over—Lachish and Azekah, for these remained among the cities of Judah, the cities of fortification. 
JER.34.8	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after king Zedekiah made
JER.34.9	to let go each one his male slave and each one his female slave, the Hebrew and the free Hebrew, so that no one among the Judeans
JER.34.10	And all the officials and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant to let go each one his male slave and each one his female slave, not enslaving them again, and they obeyed and they let them
JER.34.11	But afterward
JER.34.12	And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
JER.34.13	“Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘I made
JER.34.14	“At the end of seven years you must let go each one his fellow countryman, the Hebrew who has been sold to you and who has served you six years, and you must let him go free from you.” But your ancestors
JER.34.15	And you turned back recently
JER.34.16	But you turned back and you profaned my name when you brought back each one his male slave and each one his female slave, whom you had let go free according to their desire, and you subdued them to be to you as male slaves and as female slaves.’ 
JER.34.17	“Therefore
JER.34.18	And I will make the men who transgressed my covenant, who have not kept the words of the covenant that they made
JER.34.19	the officials of Judah, and the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf— 
JER.34.20	and I will give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of the seekers of their lives, and their dead bodies
JER.34.21	And Zedekiah the king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of the seekers of their lives, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, who retreated from you. 
JER.34.22	Look, I am going to command,’ declares
JER.35.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying,
JER.35.2	“Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them to the house of Yahweh into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.” 
JER.35.3	So I took Jaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole of the house of the Rechabites, 
JER.35.4	and I brought them to the house of Yahweh, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was beside the chamber of the officials, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah, the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold. 
JER.35.5	Then I set
JER.35.6	But they answered, “We will not drink wine, for Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our ancestor,
JER.35.7	And you shall not build a house, and you shall not sow seed, and you shall not plant a vineyard, and it shall not be for you, but in tents you shall live all your days, so that you may live many days on the surface of the land where you are dwelling as aliens.’ 
JER.35.8	And we obeyed the voice of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our ancestor,
JER.35.9	and not to build houses for our living, and there is not vineyard, or field, or seed for us. 
JER.35.10	But we have lived in tents, and we have obeyed, and we have done all that Jehonadab, our ancestor,
JER.35.11	But then
JER.35.12	And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,
JER.35.13	“Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Go and say to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Can you not learn a lesson to listen to my words?” declares
JER.35.14	“The words of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, that he commanded his descendants
JER.35.15	And I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, I have sent them over and over again,
JER.35.16	For the descendants
JER.35.17	Therefore
JER.35.18	But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, “Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Because you have listened to the command of Jonadab your ancestor,
JER.35.19	therefore
JER.36.1	And then
JER.36.2	“Take for yourself a scroll
JER.36.3	Perhaps when the house of Judah hears all the disasters
JER.36.4	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh that he had spoken to him on a scroll.
JER.36.5	And Jeremiah instructed Baruch, saying,
JER.36.6	So you must go and you shall read aloud from the scroll that you have written from my mouth the words of Yahweh in the hearing of the people in the temple of Yahweh on a day of fast, and also you shall read aloud in the hearing of all those of Judah who came from their towns. 
JER.36.7	Perhaps their plea will fall before
JER.36.8	And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet instructed him, to read aloud from the scroll the words of Yahweh in the temple of Yahweh. 
JER.36.9	And then
JER.36.10	Then Baruch read aloud from the scroll the words of Jeremiah in the temple of Yahweh, in the chamber of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, the secretary, in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple of Yahweh in the hearing of all the people. 
JER.36.11	When Micaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of Yahweh from the scroll, 
JER.36.12	he went down to the house of the king, to the chamber of the secretary, and look, all the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, and Delaiah, the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan, the son of Achbor, and Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah, the son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. 
JER.36.13	And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard at the reading aloud of Baruch from the scroll in the hearing of the people. 
JER.36.14	Then all the officials sent Jehudi, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying,
JER.36.15	And they said to him, “Sit please and read it aloud in our hearing.” So Baruch read aloud in their hearing. 
JER.36.16	And then,
JER.36.17	Then they asked Baruch, saying,
JER.36.18	And Baruch said to them, “From his mouth. He dictated to me all these words and I was writing on the scroll with the ink.” 
JER.36.19	Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go, hide yourself, you and Jeremiah, and let not a man know where you are.” 
JER.36.20	And they went to the king, to the courtyard, and they put
JER.36.21	Then the king sent Jehudi to take the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and Jehudi read it aloud in the hearing of the king, and in the hearing of all the officials who stood next to the king. 
JER.36.22	Now the king was sitting in the quarters of the winter in the ninth month, and a fire-pot was burning before
JER.36.23	And then,
JER.36.24	And the king and any of his servants who heard all these words were not startled, and they did not tear their garments. 
JER.36.25	And even when Elnathan, and Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. 
JER.36.26	And the king commanded Jerahmeel, the son of the king, and Seraiah, the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but Yahweh hid them. 
JER.36.27	And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after the king burned the scroll and the words that Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
JER.36.28	“Take again
JER.36.29	And concerning Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, you shall say, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “You have burned this scroll, saying,
JER.36.30	Therefore
JER.36.31	And I will punish him, and his offspring, and his servants for their guilt, and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the people of Judah all the disaster with which I have threatened them, but they would not listen.” ’ ” 
JER.36.32	Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah, the secretary, and he wrote on it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, had burned in the fire, and furthermore was added to them many words like these. 
JER.37.1	And king Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had made king, reigned as king in the land of Judah in place of Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim. 
JER.37.2	But he and his servants and the people of the land did not listen to the words of Yahweh that he spoke by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet. 
JER.37.3	And king Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
JER.37.4	Now Jeremiah was coming and going out in the midst of the people and they had not put him in the house of imprisonment. 
JER.37.5	And the army of Pharaoh had come out from Egypt, and the Chaldeans, who were laying siege to Jerusalem, heard their report and they withdrew from Jerusalem. 
JER.37.6	And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
JER.37.7	“Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘This is what you shall say to the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me, “Look, the army of Pharaoh, which set out to help you, is going to return to his land Egypt. 
JER.37.8	And the Chaldeans will return, and they will fight against this city, and they will capture it, and they will burn it with fire.” ’ 
JER.37.9	Thus says Yahweh: ‘You must not deceive yourselves, saying,
JER.37.10	For even if you struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and only men pierced through remained among them, each one in his tent, they would rise up and they would burn this city with fire.’ ” 
JER.37.11	And then,
JER.37.12	Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive a portion from there in the midst of the people. 
JER.37.13	And when
JER.37.14	And Jeremiah said, “That is a lie! I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.” But he would not listen to him. So Irijah seized Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. 
JER.37.15	And the officials were angry at Jeremiah and they struck him. And they put him in prison,
JER.37.16	So Jeremiah came to the dungeon
JER.37.17	Then King Zedekiah sent and fetched him. And the king questioned him in secrecy in his house, and he said, “Is there a word from Yahweh?” And Jeremiah said, “There is.” And he said, “You will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon.” 
JER.37.18	Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What did I do wrong to you, or to your servants, or to this people, that you have put me in prison?
JER.37.19	And where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying,
JER.37.20	Now then, my lord the king, please let my plea fall before you.
JER.37.21	So King Zedekiah commanded, and they handed Jeremiah over in the courtyard of the guard, and they gave to him a round loaf of bread from the street of the bakers every day
JER.38.1	Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people, saying,
JER.38.2	“Thus says Yahweh, ‘The one who stays in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague. But the one who goes out to the Chaldeans will live. And his life will be for him as booty, and he will live.’ 
JER.38.3	Thus says Yahweh, ‘Surely this city will be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.’ ” 
JER.38.4	Then the officials said to the king, “Please, this man must be killed, because
JER.38.5	And Zedekiah the king said, “Look, he is in your hand, for the king is not able to do a thing against you.” 
JER.38.6	So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the pit
JER.38.7	When Ebed-melech the Cushite, a eunuch
JER.38.8	Ebed-melech went out from the house of the king and spoke to the king, saying,
JER.38.9	“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, in that they have thrown him into the pit,
JER.38.10	Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying,
JER.38.11	So Ebed-melech took the men with him
JER.38.12	Then Ebed-melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Please put the rags
JER.38.13	And they pulled Jeremiah by the ropes and brought him up from the pit.
JER.38.14	And Zedekiah the king sent and made someone bring Jeremiah the prophet to him, to the third entrance that was at the temple
JER.38.15	And Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not surely kill me? Besides,
JER.38.16	So Zedekiah the king swore to Jeremiah in secret, saying,
JER.38.17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘If only you will go surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then you
JER.38.18	But if you do not go surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you will not escape from their hand.’ ” 
JER.38.19	And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest they give me into their hand and they abuse me.” 
JER.38.20	And Jeremiah said, “They will not give you over. Please obey the voice of Yahweh with regard to what I am saying to you, and it will go well with you, and you
JER.38.21	But if you are refusing to surrender, this is the thing that Yahweh has shown me. 
JER.38.22	Now look, all the women who remain in the house of the king of Judah are being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon. And look, they are saying, 
JER.38.22	‘Your trusted friends
JER.38.22	and they have prevailed against you. 
JER.38.22	Your feet are stuck in the mud, 
JER.38.22	so they turned backward.’ 
JER.38.23	And all your wives and your children will be led out to the Chaldeans, and you will not escape from their hand, but by the hand of the king of Babylon you will be seized, and this city will burn with fire.” 
JER.38.24	And Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “No man must know about these words so that you will not die. 
JER.38.25	And if the officials hear that I have spoken with you, and they come to you and say to you, ‘Please tell us what you said to the king. You must not conceal it from us so that we will not kill you. And what did the king say to you?’ 
JER.38.26	Then you shall say to them, ‘I was presenting my plea before
JER.38.27	And all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, and he informed them like all these words that the king commanded. So they fell silent, for the conversation
JER.38.28	And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was captured. And it happened that Jerusalem was captured.
JER.39.1	In the ninth year of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and laid siege to it. 
JER.39.2	In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city was taken by assault. 
JER.39.3	And all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim the chief officer, Nergal-sharezer the high official, with all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon. 
JER.39.4	And then
JER.39.5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And they took him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath. And he pronounced sentence
JER.39.6	And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also slaughtered all the nobles of Judah. 
JER.39.7	Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah and tied him up with bronze fetters to bring him to Babylon. 
JER.39.8	And the Chaldeans burned the palace
JER.39.9	Then the rest of the people who were left in the city, and those deserting who had deserted to him, and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard,
JER.39.10	And some of the poor people, who had nothing,
JER.39.11	And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon commanded concerning Jeremiah through
JER.39.12	“Take him and set your eyes on him. And you must not do something bad to him, but only
JER.39.13	So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard,
JER.39.14	And they sent and took Jeremiah from the courtyard of the guard and gave him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him to the house, so he stayed in the midst of the people. 
JER.39.15	And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah at his confinement in the courtyard of the guard, saying,
JER.39.16	“Go and say to Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying,
JER.39.17	But I will rescue you on that day,” declares
JER.39.18	For surely I will save you, and you will not fall by the sword. But your life will be for you as booty because you have trusted in me,” declares
JER.40.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard,
JER.40.2	And the captain of the guard
JER.40.3	and now he has brought it about,
JER.40.4	And so then look, I have released you today
JER.40.5	While he still had not turned back, Nebuzaradan added, “Return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed in an official position over the towns of Judah, and stay with him in the midst of the people. Or to wherever it is right in your eyes to go, then go there.”
JER.40.6	So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah and stayed with him in the midst of the people who were left in the land. 
JER.40.7	When all the commanders of the armies who were in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam in an official position in the land, and that he had put him in charge of
JER.40.8	then they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan, and Jehonathan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. 
JER.40.9	And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying,
JER.40.10	As for me,
JER.40.11	And also all the Judeans who were in Moab, and among the Ammonites,
JER.40.12	then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they were scattered. And they came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and they gathered wine and summer fruit that yielded in great abundance.
JER.40.13	And Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who were in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah 
JER.40.14	and said to him, “Are you at all aware
JER.40.15	Then Johanan the son of Kareah said to Gedaliah in secrecy at Mizpah, saying,
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You must not do this thing, for you are telling a lie about Ishmael.” 
JER.41.1	 And then
JER.41.2	And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah got up, along with
JER.41.3	Then Ishmael killed all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, along with
JER.41.4	And then
JER.41.5	then men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty men with shaven beards
JER.41.6	And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out to meet them from Mizpah, weeping as he came.
JER.41.7	And then,
JER.41.8	But ten men were found among them, and they said to Ishmael, “You must not kill us, for we have
JER.41.9	Now the pit
JER.41.10	Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the daughters of the king and all the people who were left at Mizpah, over whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard,
JER.41.11	When Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who were with him, heard
JER.41.12	then they took all the men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. And they met him at the great pool that is in Gibeon. 
JER.41.13	And then,
JER.41.14	So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and returned and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. 
JER.41.15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped with eight men from
JER.41.16	Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who were with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, strong men, soldiers,
JER.41.17	And they set out and stayed at the lodging place of Chimham that is near Bethlehem, intending
JER.41.18	because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them,
JER.42.1	Then all the commanders of the armies, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the smallest to the greatest, approached 
JER.42.2	and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “May our plea please fall before you,
JER.42.3	And let Yahweh your God inform us the way in which we should go and the thing that we should do.” 
JER.42.4	And Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard. Look, I am going to pray to Yahweh your God according to your words, and then
JER.42.5	Then they said to Jeremiah, “May Yahweh be against us as a true and faithful witness
JER.42.6	Whether good or bad, we will listen to the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it may go well with us when we listen to the voice of Yahweh our God.” 
JER.42.7	And then
JER.42.8	And he summoned Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the armies who were with him, and all the people from the smallest to the greatest, 
JER.42.9	and said to them, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to cause your plea to fall before him:
JER.42.10	‘If only you will stay in this land, then I will build you and I will not tear you down, and I will plant you and I will not pluck you up, for I relent of the disaster that I have brought to you. 
JER.42.11	You must not be afraid of
JER.42.12	And I will show you compassion, and he will have compassion on you and will restore you to your soil. 
JER.42.13	But if you are saying, “We will not stay in this land,” so as to not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, 
JER.42.14	saying, “No, for we will go to the land of Egypt where we will not see war, and we will not hear the sound of a horn, and we will not be hungry for bread, and there we will stay,” 
JER.42.15	then therefore
JER.42.16	then it will be that the sword that you are in fear of will overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine that you are anxious of will pursue after you there into Egypt, and there you will die. 
JER.42.17	So all the people who are determined
JER.42.18	For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will pour out on you at your going to Egypt, and you will become a curse, and a horror, and a curse formula, and a disgrace, and you will no longer see this place.” ’ 
JER.42.19	Yahweh has spoken to you, O remnant of Judah, ‘You must not go to Egypt.’ You must certainly know that I have warned you today
JER.42.20	that you have made a fatal mistake,
JER.42.21	So I have told you today,
JER.42.22	Now then, certainly you must know that by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague you will die in the place where you desire to go, to dwell as aliens there.” 
JER.43.1	 And then,
JER.43.2	Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the insolent men spoke,
JER.43.3	But Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us in order to give us into the hand of the Chaldeans, to kill us and to deport us to Babylon.” 
JER.43.4	So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies, and all the people did not listen
JER.43.5	But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies took
JER.43.6	the men, and the women, and the little children, and the daughters of the king, and everyone
JER.43.7	and they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not listen to the voice of Yahweh. And they came up to Tahpanhes. 
JER.43.8	And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, 
JER.43.9	“Take in your hands
JER.43.10	and say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “Look, I am going to send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden. And he will spread out his canopy over them. 
JER.43.11	And he will come and ravage the land of Egypt, and deliver those who are appointed for the plague, to the plague, and those who are appointed for the captivity, to the captivity, and those who are appointed for the sword, to the sword. 
JER.43.12	Then he will kindle a fire in the temples
JER.43.13	And he will break the stone pillars of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt. And he will burn the temples
JER.44.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Judeans who were living in the land of Egypt, who were living at Migdol, and Tahpanhes, and Memphis, and in the land of Pathros, saying,
JER.44.2	“Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘You yourselves have seen all the disaster that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the towns of Judah. And look, they are a site of ruins this day, and there is not in them an inhabitant, 
JER.44.3	because of
JER.44.4	And I sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending over and over again,
JER.44.5	But they did not listen and they did not incline their ears
JER.44.6	So my wrath and my anger were poured out
JER.44.7	So then, thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Why are you doing great harm to yourselves,
JER.44.8	provoking me to anger with the works of your hands, to make smoke offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to dwell as aliens, so as to cut off yourselves, and so that you are becoming as a curse, and as a disgrace among all the nations of the earth? 
JER.44.9	Have you forgotten the wicked things of your ancestors,
JER.44.10	They have not shown contrition up to this day, and they have not shown reverence, and they have not walked in my law and in my statutes that I set before you
JER.44.11	Therefore
JER.44.12	And I will take away the remnant of Judah who are determined
JER.44.13	So I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt just as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague. 
JER.44.14	And there will not be a survivor or an escapee of the remnant of Judah, those who have come to dwell as an alien there in the land of Egypt, to return to the land of Judah where they are longing
JER.44.15	Then all the men who knew that their wives were making smoke offerings to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, and all the people who lived in the land of Egypt in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
JER.44.16	“Concerning the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Yahweh, we are not going to listen to you! 
JER.44.17	But certainly we will do everything
JER.44.18	But since
JER.44.19	And indeed, when we were making smoke offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring out
JER.44.20	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and to the women, and to all the people who answered him a word, saying,
JER.44.21	“The offering that you made, smoke offerings in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you, and your ancestors,
JER.44.22	And Yahweh was no longer able to bear
JER.44.23	Because of
JER.44.24	Then Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, “Hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt. 
JER.44.25	Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,
JER.44.26	Therefore
JER.44.27	Look, I am going to watch over them for harm and not for good, and all people
JER.44.28	And the survivors of the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah few in number.
JER.44.29	And this will be to you the sign,’ declares
JER.44.30	Thus says Yahweh: ‘Look, I am going to give Pharaoh Hophra, the king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his life, just as I gave Zedekiah the king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, his enemy and the one who sought his life.’ ” 
JER.45.1	The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch, the son of Neriah, at his writing these words on a scroll from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying,
JER.45.2	“Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch: 
JER.45.3	‘You said, “Woe please to me, for Yahweh has added sorrow to my pain. I am weary in my groaning and I do not find rest.” ’ 
JER.45.4	Thus you will say to him: ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Look, what I have built I am about to tear down, and what I have planted I am about to pluck up, it is all the land. 
JER.45.5	And you, do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek great things,
JER.46.1	The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations. 
JER.46.2	Concerning Egypt: Concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco, the king of Egypt, which was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah. 
JER.46.3	“Prepare small shield and shield, 
JER.46.3	and approach for the battle! 
JER.46.4	Harness the horses and mount the steeds! 
JER.46.4	And take your stand with helmets! 
JER.46.4	Polish the spears! 
JER.46.4	Put on the body armor! 
JER.46.5	Why do I see them terrified? 
JER.46.5	They are turning back 
JER.46.5	and their warriors are beaten down. 
JER.46.5	And they have fled to a place of refuge 
JER.46.5	and they do not turn back. 
JER.46.5	Terror is from all around,” declares
JER.46.6	The swift cannot flee, 
JER.46.6	and the warrior cannot escape. 
JER.46.6	They have stumbled and they have fallen, 
JER.46.6	by the bank of the Euphrates River. 
JER.46.7	Who is this that rises like the Nile, 
JER.46.7	like the rivers whose waters surge? 
JER.46.8	Egypt rises like the Nile, 
JER.46.8	even like the rivers whose waters surge. 
JER.46.8	And he says, “Let me rise, 
JER.46.8	let me cover the earth, 
JER.46.8	let me destroy cities, 
JER.46.8	and the inhabitants in them.” 
JER.46.9	Go up, O horses, 
JER.46.9	and drive madly, O chariots,
JER.46.9	and let the warriors go forth; 
JER.46.9	Cush and Put, who wield the small shield, 
JER.46.9	and Lud, who wield and bend the bow. 
JER.46.10	For that day is to the Lord Yahweh of hosts 
JER.46.10	a day of retribution, 
JER.46.10	to take revenge on his foes. 
JER.46.10	And the sword will devour and be satisfied, 
JER.46.10	and it will drink its fill of their blood, 
JER.46.10	for a sacrifice is for the Lord Yahweh of hosts 
JER.46.10	in the land of the north by the Euphrates River. 
JER.46.11	Go up to Gilead and take balm, 
JER.46.11	O virgin of the daughter of Egypt. 
JER.46.11	In vain
JER.46.11	there is no healing for you. 
JER.46.12	The nations have heard your shame, 
JER.46.12	and your cry of lament fills the earth. 
JER.46.12	For warrior has stumbled against warrior, 
JER.46.12	together they have fallen, the two of them. 
JER.46.13	The word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon to attack the land of Egypt: 
JER.46.14	“Declare in Egypt, and proclaim in Migdol, 
JER.46.14	and proclaim in Memphis and in Tahpanhes, 
JER.46.14	say, ‘Take your stand and be prepared, 
JER.46.14	for the sword will devour those all around you.’ 
JER.46.15	Why are your bulls defeated? 
JER.46.15	He did not stand because Yahweh thrust him down. 
JER.46.16	He multiplied the ones
JER.46.16	Furthermore, each one fell to his neighbor, 
JER.46.16	and said, ‘Stand up, and let us return to our people 
JER.46.16	and to the land of our birth, 
JER.46.16	because of
JER.46.17	They will call there, 
JER.46.17	‘Pharaoh, the king of Egypt is but a roar, 
JER.46.17	he missed the opportunity.’
JER.46.18	As I live,”
JER.46.18	Yahweh of hosts is his name, 
JER.46.18	“one will come like Tabor among the mountains 
JER.46.18	and like Carmel by the sea. 
JER.46.19	Pack your baggage for exile, 
JER.46.19	O inhabitants
JER.46.19	for Memphis will become as a horror, 
JER.46.19	and it will be destroyed, without
JER.46.20	Egypt is a beautiful heifer, 
JER.46.20	but a gadfly from the north will come against her. 
JER.46.21	Even her mercenaries in her midst are like calves of fattening, 
JER.46.21	for they also have turned away, 
JER.46.21	they have fled together. 
JER.46.21	They stand not, 
JER.46.21	for the day of their calamity has come, 
JER.46.21	the time of their punishment. 
JER.46.22	Her sound is like a snake that glides away, 
JER.46.22	for they march in force. 
JER.46.22	And with axes they come to her 
JER.46.22	like those who chop trees. 
JER.46.23	They will cut down her forest,” declares
JER.46.23	“for it is impenetrable.
JER.46.23	Yes, they are more numerous than locusts,
JER.46.23	and they are without number.
JER.46.24	The daughter of Egypt will be ashamed, 
JER.46.24	she will be given into the hand of the people of the north.” 
JER.46.25	Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, said, “Look, I am going to punish Amon of Thebes, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, and her gods, and her kings, even Pharaoh and those who trust in him. 
JER.46.26	And I will give them into the hand of the seekers of their lives,
JER.46.27	“But as for you, my servant Jacob, you must not be afraid, 
JER.46.27	and Israel, you must not be dismayed, 
JER.46.27	for look, I am going to save you from far, 
JER.46.27	and your offspring from the land of their captivity. 
JER.46.27	And Jacob will return, 
JER.46.27	and he will be quiet, 
JER.46.27	and he will be at ease, 
JER.46.27	and without one who makes him afraid. 
JER.46.28	You must not be afraid, my servant Jacob,” declares
JER.46.28	“for I am with you. 
JER.46.28	For I will make a complete destruction in all the nations where I scattered you, 
JER.46.28	but you I will not make a complete destruction, 
JER.46.28	though I will chastise you to the measure, 
JER.46.28	and I will certainly not leave you unpunished.” 
JER.47.1	The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines before
JER.47.2	Thus says Yahweh: 
JER.47.2	“Look, waters are rising from the north, 
JER.47.2	and they will become as a raging torrent, 
JER.47.2	and they will overflow the land, 
JER.47.2	and that which fills it, 
JER.47.2	the city and those who live in it. 
JER.47.2	And the people will cry out, 
JER.47.2	and every inhabitant of the land will wail, 
JER.47.3	from the sound of the stamping of the hoofs of his stallions, 
JER.47.3	from the clattering of his chariots,
JER.47.3	the noise of their wheels. 
JER.47.3	Fathers do not turn to their children 
JER.47.3	because of the slackness of their hands. 
JER.47.4	Because of the day that is coming 
JER.47.4	to destroy all the Philistines, 
JER.47.4	to cut off from Tyre and from Sidon 
JER.47.4	every survivor who could help, 
JER.47.4	for Yahweh is destroying the Philistines, 
JER.47.4	the remnant of the coastland of Caphtor. 
JER.47.5	Baldness has come upon Gaza, 
JER.47.5	Ashkelon is destroyed. 
JER.47.5	O remnant of their valley, 
JER.47.5	how long
JER.47.6	Ah, sword of Yahweh, 
JER.47.6	how long
JER.47.6	Gather to your sheath, 
JER.47.6	keep quiet and stand still. 
JER.47.7	How can you be quiet 
JER.47.7	when Yahweh has given an order to it? 
JER.47.7	Against Ashkelon and against the shore of the sea, 
JER.47.7	there he has appointed it.” 
JER.48.1	Concerning Moab, thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: 
JER.48.1	“Woe to Nebo, 
JER.48.1	for it is devastated. 
JER.48.1	It is ashamed, 
JER.48.1	Kiriathaim is captured. 
JER.48.1	Misgab is ashamed, 
JER.48.1	and it is filled with terror. 
JER.48.2	The glory of Moab is no longer. 
JER.48.2	In Heshbon they planned evil against her. 
JER.48.2	Come and let us cut her off from being a nation. 
JER.48.2	Also, Madmen, you will be silent. 
JER.48.2	After you will go the sword. 
JER.48.3	The sound of a cry of distress arises from Horonaim, 
JER.48.3	devastation and great destruction. 
JER.48.4	Moab is broken, 
JER.48.4	her little ones make heard
JER.48.5	For the ascent of Luhith, 
JER.48.5	in weeping they go weeping, 
JER.48.5	For on the slope of Horonaim they have heard 
JER.48.5	the distresses of the cry of distress of the destruction. 
JER.48.6	Flee! Save your life! 
JER.48.6	For
JER.48.7	For because of your trusting in your works and in your treasures, 
JER.48.7	even you yourselves will be taken, 
JER.48.7	and Chemosh will go out into the exile, 
JER.48.7	his priests and his officials together. 
JER.48.8	And the destroyer will come to every town, 
JER.48.8	and a town will not escape. 
JER.48.8	And the valley will be destroyed, 
JER.48.8	and the plain will be destroyed, as Yahweh has spoken. 
JER.48.9	Give salt for Moab, 
JER.48.9	for certainly she will go to ruin, 
JER.48.9	and her towns will become as a desolation, 
JER.48.9	without
JER.48.10	The one who does the work of Yahweh with slackness is cursed, 
JER.48.10	and the one who keeps away blood from his sword is cursed. 
JER.48.11	Moab has been at ease from his youth, 
JER.48.11	and he has been quiet on his dregs, 
JER.48.11	and he has not been poured out from vessel to vessel, 
JER.48.11	and he has not gone into exile. 
JER.48.11	Therefore
JER.48.11	and his fragrance has not changed. 
JER.48.12	Therefore
JER.48.12	“and I will send to him decanters,
JER.48.12	and they will decant him, 
JER.48.12	and his vessels they will empty out, 
JER.48.12	and their jars they will smash. 
JER.48.13	Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, 
JER.48.13	just as the house of Israel were ashamed of Bethel, their trust. 
JER.48.14	How can you say, ‘we are warriors, 
JER.48.14	and men of might for the battle.’ 
JER.48.15	Moab is destroyed, 
JER.48.15	and his towns have gone up, 
JER.48.15	and the choice of his young men have gone down to the slaughtering,” 
JER.48.15	declares
JER.48.16	“The disaster of Moab is near to come, 
JER.48.16	and his disaster approaches very quickly.
JER.48.17	Mourn for him, all his surroundings, 
JER.48.17	and all those who knew his name. 
JER.48.17	Say, ‘How the staff of might is broken, 
JER.48.17	the staff of glory.’ 
JER.48.18	Come down from glory and sit on the parched ground, 
JER.48.18	O inhabitant, daughter of Dibon, 
JER.48.18	for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you, 
JER.48.18	he has destroyed your fortifications. 
JER.48.19	Stand by the road and watch, 
JER.48.19	O inhabitant of Aroer. 
JER.48.19	Ask the man who is fleeing and the woman who is escaping, 
JER.48.19	say, ‘What has happened?’ 
JER.48.20	Moab is ashamed, 
JER.48.20	for it is filled with terror. 
JER.48.20	Wail and cry out, 
JER.48.20	tell it by Arnon that Moab is devastated. 
JER.48.21	Judgment has also come to the land of the plain, to Holon, and to Jahaz, and on Mephaath, 
JER.48.22	and on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Beth-diblathaim, 
JER.48.23	and on Kiriathaim, and on Beth-gamul, and on Beth-meon, 
JER.48.24	and on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the towns of the land of Moab, the far and the near. 
JER.48.25	The horn of Moab is cut off and his arm is broken,” declares
JER.48.26	“Make him drunk, 
JER.48.26	because he magnified himself against Yahweh, 
JER.48.26	and let Moab wallow in his vomit. 
JER.48.26	And he also will become a laughingstock. 
JER.48.27	Now was not Israel the laughingstock to you? 
JER.48.27	Or was he found among thieves? 
JER.48.27	For as often as
JER.48.27	you shook your head. 
JER.48.28	Leave the towns and dwell on the rock, 
JER.48.28	O inhabitants of Moab, 
JER.48.28	and be like the dove, 
JER.48.28	it nests on the sides of the mouth of a ravine. 
JER.48.29	We have heard of the pride of Moab 
JER.48.29	—he is very proud— 
JER.48.29	his height, and his pride, and his arrogance, 
JER.48.29	and the haughtiness of his heart. 
JER.48.30	I know his insolence,” declares
JER.48.30	“and his boastings are false;
JER.48.30	they act falsely.
JER.48.31	Therefore
JER.48.31	and for all of Moab I cry out, 
JER.48.31	for the people
JER.48.32	More than the weeping of Jazer 
JER.48.32	I weep for you, O vine Sibmah. 
JER.48.32	Your branches cross over the sea, 
JER.48.32	up to the sea of Jazer they reach. 
JER.48.32	Upon your summer fruit and upon your vintage 
JER.48.32	the destroyer has fallen. 
JER.48.33	And joy and rejoicing have been taken away from the fruitful land, 
JER.48.33	even from the land of Moab. 
JER.48.33	And the wine from the wine presses 
JER.48.33	I have caused to disappear. 
JER.48.33	He will not tread with exuberant shouts.
JER.48.33	Exuberant shouts
JER.48.34	From the cry for help of Heshbon, up to Elealeh, 
JER.48.34	up to Jahaz, they give their voice, 
JER.48.34	from Zoar up to Horonaim, up to Eglath-shelishiyah, 
JER.48.34	for even the waters of Nimrim have become as a desolation. 
JER.48.35	And I will cause to disappear for Moab,” declares
JER.48.35	“the one who presents a sacrifice at a high place, 
JER.48.35	and the one who burns a smoke offering to his gods. 
JER.48.36	Therefore
JER.48.36	It moans for the people
JER.48.36	Therefore
JER.48.37	For on every head is baldness, 
JER.48.37	and every beard is trimmed. 
JER.48.37	On all the hands, slashes, 
JER.48.37	and on the loins, sackcloth. 
JER.48.38	On all the roofs of Moab, and in its public squares, 
JER.48.38	there is wailing everywhere. 
JER.48.38	For I have broken Moab like a vessel, 
JER.48.38	there is no delight in it,” declares
JER.48.39	“How it is filled with terror! How they wail! 
JER.48.39	How Moab has turned his back! He is disgraced! 
JER.48.39	So Moab has become as a derision, 
JER.48.39	and as a terror for all his surrounding peoples.” 
JER.48.40	For thus says Yahweh, 
JER.48.40	“Look, like an eagle he will swoop down, 
JER.48.40	and he will spread out his wings against Moab. 
JER.48.41	Kerioth will be taken, 
JER.48.41	and the strongholds will be conquered, 
JER.48.41	and the hearts
JER.48.41	like the heart of a woman who is in labor. 
JER.48.42	And Moab will be destroyed from being a people, 
JER.48.42	because against Yahweh he magnified himself. 
JER.48.43	Dread, and pit, and a trapping net are against you, 
JER.48.43	O inhabitant of Moab,” declares
JER.48.44	“He who flees before
JER.48.44	will fall into the pit, 
JER.48.44	and the one who climbs up from the pit 
JER.48.44	will be caught in the trapping net, 
JER.48.44	for I will bring on Moab 
JER.48.44	the year of their punishment,” declares
JER.48.45	“In the shadow of Heshbon 
JER.48.45	fugitives stand without strength, 
JER.48.45	for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, 
JER.48.45	and a flame from Sihon. 
JER.48.45	And it has eaten the forehead of Moab, 
JER.48.45	and the skulls
JER.48.46	Woe to you, Moab! 
JER.48.46	The people of Chemosh have perished. 
JER.48.46	For your sons have been taken into captivity, 
JER.48.46	and your daughters into captivity. 
JER.48.47	Yet I will restore the fortunes
JER.48.47	in the last of the days,” declares
JER.48.47	Thus far
JER.49.1	Concerning the Ammonites:
JER.49.1	“Are there no sons for Israel? 
JER.49.1	Or is there no heir for him? 
JER.49.1	Why has Milcom taken possession of Gad, 
JER.49.1	and his people dwelled in its towns? 
JER.49.2	Therefore
JER.49.2	“and I will sound against Rabbah, the Ammonites,
JER.49.2	the alarm of the war, 
JER.49.2	and it will become as a mound of desolation, 
JER.49.2	and its daughters will burn in the fire. 
JER.49.2	Then Israel will dispossess his dispossessors,” says Yahweh. 
JER.49.3	“Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is devastated. 
JER.49.3	Cry out, O daughters of Rabbah, put on sackcloth. 
JER.49.3	Lament and run back and forth among the walls. 
JER.49.3	For Milcom will go into exile, 
JER.49.3	his priests and his officials together. 
JER.49.4	Why do you boast in your valleys? 
JER.49.4	Your valleys
JER.49.4	O unfaithful daughter, who trusted in her treasures, 
JER.49.4	who said, ‘Who will come against me?’ 
JER.49.5	Look, I am going to bring dread on you,” 
JER.49.5	declares
JER.49.5	“from all your surrounding neighbors. 
JER.49.5	And you will be scattered, 
JER.49.5	each one before it,
JER.49.5	and there is no one who gathers the fugitives.
JER.49.6	Yet afterward
JER.49.6	the fortunes
JER.49.7	Concerning Edom, thus says Yahweh of hosts: 
JER.49.7	“Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? 
JER.49.7	Has counsel become lost from those who understand? 
JER.49.7	Is their wisdom rotting? 
JER.49.8	Flee! Turn back! Get down low!
JER.49.8	O inhabitants of Dedan. 
JER.49.8	For I will bring upon him the disaster of Esau 
JER.49.8	at the time when I will punish him. 
JER.49.9	If grape-gatherers come to you, 
JER.49.9	would they not leave gleanings? 
JER.49.9	If thieves in the night, 
JER.49.9	they destroy only enough for them.
JER.49.10	But I have stripped Esau bare. 
JER.49.10	I have uncovered his hiding places, 
JER.49.10	and he is not able to hide himself. 
JER.49.10	His offspring are devastated, along with
JER.49.10	and his neighbors, and he is no more.
JER.49.11	Leave your orphans. I will let them
JER.49.11	And your widows, let them trust in me.” 
JER.49.12	For thus says Yahweh, “Look, those who are not condemned
JER.49.13	For I have sworn by myself,” declares
JER.49.14	I have heard a message from Yahweh, 
JER.49.14	and a messenger has been sent among the nations. 
JER.49.14	“Gather and come against her, 
JER.49.14	and rise for the battle.” 
JER.49.15	“For look, I will make you small among the nations, 
JER.49.15	despised by the humankind. 
JER.49.16	Your terror has deceived you, 
JER.49.16	the pride of your heart, 
JER.49.16	O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, 
JER.49.16	you who seize the height of the hill. 
JER.49.16	Though you make your nest high like the eagle, 
JER.49.16	from there I will bring you down,” declares
JER.49.17	“And Edom will become as a horror, 
JER.49.17	everyone who passes by it
JER.49.17	and will hiss because of all its blows. 
JER.49.18	As the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah 
JER.49.18	and their neighbors,” says Yahweh, 
JER.49.18	“no one
JER.49.18	and the son of humankind will not dwell as an alien in it. 
JER.49.19	Look, like a lion he comes up from the thickets of the Jordan 
JER.49.19	to a pastureland by a constantly flowing stream.
JER.49.19	So I will chase him away hurriedly
JER.49.19	And whoever is chosen I will appoint over it. 
JER.49.19	For who is like me, and who can summon me? 
JER.49.19	And who is this, the shepherd who can stand before me?”
JER.49.20	Therefore
JER.49.20	and his plans that he has planned against the inhabitants of Teman. 
JER.49.20	Surely
JER.49.20	the little ones of the flock. 
JER.49.20	Surely
JER.49.20	their grazing place. 
JER.49.21	The earth will quake from the sound of their falling. 
JER.49.21	A cry of distress! Their voice will be heard at the Red Sea.
JER.49.22	Look, like an eagle he will go up and he will swoop down, 
JER.49.22	and he will spread out his wings against Bozrah. 
JER.49.22	And the heart of the warriors of Edom will be in that day 
JER.49.22	like the heart of a woman who is in labor. 
JER.49.23	Concerning Damascus: 
JER.49.23	“Hamath and Arpad are ashamed, 
JER.49.23	for they have heard bad news; 
JER.49.23	they melt. 
JER.49.23	There is concern in the sea. 
JER.49.23	It is not able to keep quiet. 
JER.49.24	Damascus has grown slack. 
JER.49.24	She has turned away to flee and panic. 
JER.49.24	Anxiety has seized her, 
JER.49.24	and labor pains have grasped her, 
JER.49.24	like a woman in labor. 
JER.49.25	How the city of praise has not been abandoned! 
JER.49.25	The city of my joy! 
JER.49.26	Therefore
JER.49.26	and all the soldiers
JER.49.27	“And I will kindle a fire at the wall of Damascus, 
JER.49.27	and it will devour the citadel fortresses of Ben-hadad.” 
JER.49.28	Concerning Kedar and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor that Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon defeated. Thus says Yahweh: 
JER.49.28	“Rise up, go up against Kedar 
JER.49.28	and destroy the people
JER.49.29	They will take their tents, and their flocks, 
JER.49.29	their tent curtains, and all their equipment, 
JER.49.29	and their camels they will carry away for themselves, 
JER.49.29	and they will call to them, ‘Terror is from all around.’ 
JER.49.30	Flee! Wander far away! Get down low!
JER.49.30	O inhabitants of Hazor,” declares
JER.49.30	“For Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, has planned a plan against you. 
JER.49.30	And he has schemed
JER.49.31	Rise up, go up against a nation which is at ease, 
JER.49.31	living securely,”
JER.49.31	“There are no gates and there are no bars
JER.49.31	they dwell alone. 
JER.49.32	And their camels will become as plunder, 
JER.49.32	and the multitude of their livestock as spoil. 
JER.49.32	And I will scatter to every wind those who are trimmed to the side, 
JER.49.32	and from every side
JER.49.33	“And Hazor will become as a lair of jackals, 
JER.49.33	a waste forever; 
JER.49.33	no one will live there, 
JER.49.33	and no son of humankind will dwell as an alien in it.” 
JER.49.34	The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the king of Judah, saying,
JER.49.35	“Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 
JER.49.35	‘Look, I am going to break the bow of Elam, 
JER.49.35	the first and best of their might. 
JER.49.36	And I will bring to Elam four winds, 
JER.49.36	from the four corners of heaven, 
JER.49.36	and I will scatter them to all these winds, 
JER.49.36	and there will not be a nation 
JER.49.36	where the scattered people of Elam will not go. 
JER.49.37	So I will shatter Elam before
JER.49.37	and before
JER.49.37	And I will bring disaster upon them, 
JER.49.37	my burning anger,
JER.49.37	‘And I will send after them the sword 
JER.49.37	until I have destroyed them. 
JER.49.38	And I will set my throne in Elam 
JER.49.38	and I will destroy from there king and officials,’ declares
JER.49.39	‘And then
JER.49.39	I will restore the fortunes
JER.50.1	The word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet: 
JER.50.2	“Declare among the nations and proclaim, 
JER.50.2	and lift up a banner. 
JER.50.2	Proclaim, you must not conceal it. 
JER.50.2	Say, ‘Babylon is captured, 
JER.50.2	Bel is ashamed, 
JER.50.2	Merodach is filled with terror, 
JER.50.2	her idols are ashamed, 
JER.50.2	her idols are filled with terror. 
JER.50.3	For a nation will come up against her from the north. 
JER.50.3	It will make her land as a horror, 
JER.50.3	and an inhabitant will not be in her. 
JER.50.3	From humans
JER.50.3	They will go away. 
JER.50.4	In those days and in that time,’ ” declares
JER.50.4	“the people
JER.50.4	they and the people
JER.50.4	Weeping as they go,
JER.50.4	and Yahweh their God they will seek. 
JER.50.5	They will ask the way to Zion, 
JER.50.5	turning their faces there. 
JER.50.5	They will come and join themselves to Yahweh 
JER.50.5	by an everlasting covenant
JER.50.6	My people have become lost sheep, 
JER.50.6	their shepherds have caused them to go astray. 
JER.50.6	They led them away to the mountains. 
JER.50.6	From mountain to hill they have gone, 
JER.50.6	they have forgotten their resting place. 
JER.50.7	All those who found them have devoured them. 
JER.50.7	And their foes have said, ‘We are not guilty, 
JER.50.7	because
JER.50.7	even Yahweh, the hope of their ancestors.’
JER.50.8	Flee from the midst of Babylon, 
JER.50.8	and from the land of the Chaldeans. 
JER.50.8	Go out and be like he-goats 
JER.50.8	before
JER.50.9	For look, I am going to stir up, 
JER.50.9	and I am going to bring against Babylon 
JER.50.9	a contingent of great nations 
JER.50.9	from the land of the north. 
JER.50.9	And they will draw up a battle formation against her, 
JER.50.9	from there she will be captured. 
JER.50.9	Their arrows are like a warrior who has achieved success, 
JER.50.9	he does not return without success. 
JER.50.10	And Chaldea will be as booty, 
JER.50.10	all those who plunder her will be satisfied,” declares
JER.50.11	“Though you rejoice, though you exult, 
JER.50.11	O plunderers of my inheritance, 
JER.50.11	though you frisk about like a heifer on the grass, 
JER.50.11	and you neigh like the powerful stallions, 
JER.50.12	your mother will be very ashamed. 
JER.50.12	She who gave birth to you will be humiliated.
JER.50.12	Look, she will be the least of the nations, 
JER.50.12	a desert,
JER.50.13	Because of the anger of Yahweh she will not be inhabited, 
JER.50.13	but she will be a wasteland, all of her. 
JER.50.13	Everyone who passes by Babylon will be appalled 
JER.50.13	and will hiss because of all her wounds. 
JER.50.14	Draw up a battle formation at Babylon all around, 
JER.50.14	all those who bend the bow, shoot at her. 
JER.50.14	You must not spare arrows,
JER.50.14	for she has sinned against Yahweh. 
JER.50.15	Raise a war cry against her on all sides. 
JER.50.15	She has surrendered.
JER.50.15	Her towers have fallen, 
JER.50.15	her walls are ruined. 
JER.50.15	For this is the vengeance of Yahweh. 
JER.50.15	Take revenge on her. 
JER.50.15	As she has done to others, 
JER.50.15	so do to her. 
JER.50.16	Cut off the sower from Babylon, 
JER.50.16	and the one who uses the sickle in the time of harvest. 
JER.50.16	Because of
JER.50.16	each one will turn to their people, 
JER.50.16	and each one will flee to their land. 
JER.50.17	Israel is a sheep scattered, 
JER.50.17	lions drove them away. 
JER.50.17	The first who devoured it was the king of Assyria, 
JER.50.17	and now at the end Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, gnawed its bones.” 
JER.50.18	Therefore
JER.50.18	“Look, I am going to punish the king of Babylon and his land 
JER.50.18	just as I punished the king of Assyria. 
JER.50.19	And I will restore Israel to its pasture, 
JER.50.19	and it will feed on Carmel, and in Bashan, 
JER.50.19	and on the hills
JER.50.19	its hunger will be satisfied. 
JER.50.20	In those days and at that time,” declares
JER.50.20	“the guilt of Israel will be sought, but there is none, 
JER.50.20	and the sins of Judah, but they will not be found, 
JER.50.20	for I will forgive those I left behind. 
JER.50.21	To the land of Merathaim, 
JER.50.21	go up against her, 
JER.50.21	and against the inhabitants of Pekod, 
JER.50.21	massacre and destroy them,” declares
JER.50.21	“and do according to all that I have commanded you. 
JER.50.22	The sound of battle is in the land, 
JER.50.22	and great destruction. 
JER.50.23	How the blacksmith’s hammer of all the earth is cut down and broken! 
JER.50.23	How Babylon has become as a horror among the nations! 
JER.50.24	I laid a bird snare for you, and you were caught, O Babylon. 
JER.50.24	But you yourself did not know. 
JER.50.24	You were discovered and seized, 
JER.50.24	because with Yahweh you measured yourself. 
JER.50.25	Yahweh has opened his armory, 
JER.50.25	and he has brought out the weapons of his wrath, 
JER.50.25	for it is a word for my Lord Yahweh of hosts 
JER.50.25	in the land of the Chaldeans. 
JER.50.26	Come against her from the end, 
JER.50.26	open her granaries. 
JER.50.26	Pile her up like heaps and destroy her. 
JER.50.26	Let there be no remnant for her. 
JER.50.27	Massacre all her bulls, 
JER.50.27	let them go down to the slaughtering. 
JER.50.27	Woe to them, for their day has come, 
JER.50.27	the time of their punishment. 
JER.50.28	There is the sound of fugitives and survivors 
JER.50.28	from the land of Babylon, 
JER.50.28	to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God, 
JER.50.28	the vengeance for his temple. 
JER.50.29	Summon archers against Babylon, 
JER.50.29	all those who bend the bow. 
JER.50.29	Encamp all around her, 
JER.50.29	there must not be for her an escape. 
JER.50.29	Take revenge on her according to her deeds. 
JER.50.29	According to all that she has done, so do to her. 
JER.50.29	For against Yahweh she has behaved insolently, 
JER.50.29	against the Holy One of Israel. 
JER.50.30	Therefore
JER.50.30	and all her soldiers
JER.50.31	“Look, I am against you, O arrogant one,” 
JER.50.31	declares
JER.50.31	“for your day has come, 
JER.50.31	the time when I will punish you. 
JER.50.32	And the arrogant one will stumble and fall, 
JER.50.32	and there is no one who raises him up. 
JER.50.32	And I will kindle a fire in his cities, 
JER.50.32	and it will devour everything around him.” 
JER.50.33	Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 
JER.50.33	“The people
JER.50.33	and the people
JER.50.33	for
JER.50.33	they refuse to let them go free. 
JER.50.34	Their redeemer is strong, 
JER.50.34	his name is Yahweh of hosts. 
JER.50.34	Surely he will plead their case, 
JER.50.34	in order to make peace for the earth, 
JER.50.34	but to cause unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon. 
JER.50.35	A sword against the Chaldeans,” declares
JER.50.35	“and against the inhabitants of Babylon, 
JER.50.35	and against her officials, 
JER.50.35	and against her wise men. 
JER.50.36	A sword against the oracle priests, 
JER.50.36	and they will become foolish. 
JER.50.36	A sword against her warriors, 
JER.50.36	and they will be filled with terror. 
JER.50.37	A sword against his horses, 
JER.50.37	and against his chariots,
JER.50.37	and against all the foreign troops who are in the midst of her, 
JER.50.37	so that they may become as women. 
JER.50.37	A sword against her treasures, 
JER.50.37	so that they may be plundered. 
JER.50.38	A drought will come against her waters, 
JER.50.38	and they will dry up, 
JER.50.38	for it is a land of images, 
JER.50.38	and because of the frightful objects, they act like madmen. 
JER.50.39	Therefore
JER.50.39	and daughters of ostriches
JER.50.39	And she will not be inhabited again forever,
JER.50.39	and she will not be dwelt in for all generations.
JER.50.40	As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah 
JER.50.40	and their neighbors,” declares
JER.50.40	“no one will live there, 
JER.50.40	and the son of humankind will not dwell as an alien in her. 
JER.50.41	Look, a people is about to come 
JER.50.41	from the north, 
JER.50.41	and a great nation and many kings are woken up 
JER.50.41	from the remotest part of the earth. 
JER.50.42	They keep hold of bow and short sword. 
JER.50.42	They are cruel and they have no mercy. 
JER.50.42	Their sound is like the sea, it roars, 
JER.50.42	and upon horses they ride. 
JER.50.42	Drawn up for battle as a man for the battle, 
JER.50.42	against you, O daughter of Babylon. 
JER.50.43	The king of Babylon heard their report 
JER.50.43	and his hands grew slack. 
JER.50.43	Anxiety has seized him, 
JER.50.43	fear and pain like the woman who gives birth. 
JER.50.44	Look, like a lion he comes up from the thickets
JER.50.44	against a pastureland by a constantly flowing stream,
JER.50.44	so I will chase them away quickly
JER.50.44	and I will appoint whoever is chosen over her. 
JER.50.44	For who is like me, and who can summon me, 
JER.50.44	and who is this shepherd who can stand before me?
JER.50.45	Therefore
JER.50.45	that he has planned against Babylon, 
JER.50.45	and his plans 
JER.50.45	that he has planned against the land of the Chaldeans. 
JER.50.45	Surely
JER.50.45	the little ones of the flock. 
JER.50.45	Surely
JER.50.45	to be desolate over them. 
JER.50.46	At the sound, ‘Babylon has been captured,’ 
JER.50.46	the earth will quake, 
JER.50.46	and a cry for help among the nations 
JER.50.46	will be heard.” 
JER.51.1	 Thus says Yahweh: 
JER.51.1	“Look, I am going to stir up against Babylon 
JER.51.1	and against the inhabitants of Leb-qamai a destructive wind. 
JER.51.2	And I will send winnowers to Babylon, 
JER.51.2	and they will winnow her, 
JER.51.2	and they will lay waste her land, 
JER.51.2	for they will be against her from all sides on the day of disaster. 
JER.51.3	Let not him who bends the bow shoot his bow, 
JER.51.3	and let him not rise high in his body armor. 
JER.51.3	And you must not spare her young men; 
JER.51.3	destroy her whole army. 
JER.51.4	And they will fall slain in the land of the Chaldeans, 
JER.51.4	and pierced through in her streets. 
JER.51.5	For neither Israel nor Judah is a widower from their God, 
JER.51.5	from Yahweh of hosts, 
JER.51.5	though their land is full of guilt 
JER.51.5	against the Holy One of Israel.” 
JER.51.6	Flee from the midst of Babylon and save each one his life. 
JER.51.6	You must not perish because of her guilt. 
JER.51.6	For this is the time of vengeance for Yahweh, 
JER.51.6	he will repay her what is deserved. 
JER.51.7	Babylon was a cup of gold in the hand of Yahweh, 
JER.51.7	making drunk all the earth. 
JER.51.7	The nations drank of her wine. 
JER.51.7	Therefore
JER.51.8	Suddenly Babylon has fallen and she is shattered. 
JER.51.8	Wail over her! 
JER.51.8	Take balm for her wounds, 
JER.51.8	perhaps she may be healed. 
JER.51.9	We tried to heal Babylon, and she was not healed. 
JER.51.9	Forsake her and let us go each one to his country, 
JER.51.9	for her judgment has reached to the heavens, 
JER.51.9	and it has been lifted up to the skies. 
JER.51.10	Yahweh has brought forth our vindication. 
JER.51.10	Come and let us make known in Zion the work of Yahweh our God. 
JER.51.11	Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers! 
JER.51.11	Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes. 
JER.51.11	Because his plan concerning Babylon is to destroy it, 
JER.51.11	for that is the vengeance of Yahweh, 
JER.51.11	the vengeance for his temple. 
JER.51.12	Against the walls of Babylon raise a banner; 
JER.51.12	post a strong watch,
JER.51.12	for Yahweh has both planned as well as performed 
JER.51.12	what he has spoken concerning the inhabitants of Babylon. 
JER.51.13	O you who live by mighty waters, rich in treasures, 
JER.51.13	your end has come, the measure of your life.
JER.51.14	Yahweh of hosts has sworn by himself, 
JER.51.14	“Surely I will fill you with troops like the creeping locusts,
JER.51.14	and they will sing over you a war cry.” 
JER.51.15	He is the one who made the earth by his power, 
JER.51.15	the one who created the world by his wisdom, 
JER.51.15	and by his understanding he stretched out the heavens. 
JER.51.16	At the giving of his voice 
JER.51.16	there is a roar of waters in the heavens, 
JER.51.16	and he causes the patches of mist 
JER.51.16	to go up from the end of the earth. 
JER.51.16	He makes lightning for the rain, 
JER.51.16	and he brings out the wind from his storehouses. 
JER.51.17	All humankind turns out to be stupid, 
JER.51.17	without knowledge. 
JER.51.17	Every goldsmith is put to shame 
JER.51.17	by the divine image. 
JER.51.17	For his cast image is a lie, 
JER.51.17	and there is no breath in them. 
JER.51.18	They are worthless, 
JER.51.18	a work of mockery. 
JER.51.18	At the time of their punishment, 
JER.51.18	they will perish. 
JER.51.19	The portion of Jacob is not like these, 
JER.51.19	for he is the creator of everything,
JER.51.19	and the tribe of his inheritance. 
JER.51.19	Yahweh of hosts is his name. 
JER.51.20	He says, “You are a war club for me, 
JER.51.20	a weapon of battle, 
JER.51.20	and I smash nations with you, 
JER.51.20	and I destroy kingdoms with you. 
JER.51.21	And I smash the horse with you, 
JER.51.21	and its rider, 
JER.51.21	and I smash the chariot with you, 
JER.51.21	and its rider. 
JER.51.22	And I smash man and woman with you, 
JER.51.22	and I smash the old man and the boy with you, 
JER.51.22	and I smash the young man and the young woman with you. 
JER.51.23	And I smash the shepherd and his flock with you, 
JER.51.23	and I smash the farmer and his team with you, 
JER.51.23	and I smash the governors and the officials with you. 
JER.51.24	And I will repay Babylon, 
JER.51.24	and all the inhabitants of Chaldea, 
JER.51.24	all their wickedness that they have done in Zion 
JER.51.24	before your eyes,” declares
JER.51.25	“Look, I am against you, 
JER.51.25	O mountain of the destruction,” declares
JER.51.25	“the one that destroys the whole earth. 
JER.51.25	And I will stretch out my hand against you, 
JER.51.25	and I will roll you down from the cliffs, 
JER.51.25	and I will make you as a mountain burned away. 
JER.51.26	They will not take from you 
JER.51.26	a stone for a corner, 
JER.51.26	and a stone for a foundation, 
JER.51.26	for you will be an everlasting desolation,”
JER.51.27	Raise a banner in the land; 
JER.51.27	blow a horn among the nations; 
JER.51.27	prepare for holy war against her; 
JER.51.27	summon the nations against her, 
JER.51.27	the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz; 
JER.51.27	summon against her an official; 
JER.51.27	bring up horses
JER.51.28	Prepare the nations for holy war against her, 
JER.51.28	the kings of the Medes, 
JER.51.28	with their governors and all their officials, 
JER.51.28	and every land of their dominion. 
JER.51.29	And the land quakes and writhes, 
JER.51.29	for the plans of Yahweh against Babylon stand, 
JER.51.29	to make the land of Babylon as a horror, 
JER.51.29	without
JER.51.30	The warriors of Babylon have ceased to fight, 
JER.51.30	they remain in the strongholds, 
JER.51.30	their power has dried up, 
JER.51.30	they have become as women. 
JER.51.30	Her dwelling places are set on fire, 
JER.51.30	her bars are broken. 
JER.51.31	one runner runs to meet another runner, 
JER.51.31	and one messenger to meet another messenger, 
JER.51.31	to tell the king of Babylon that his city has been captured, 
JER.51.31	from end to end.
JER.51.32	And the fords have been seized, 
JER.51.32	and the reed marshes have been burned with fire, 
JER.51.32	and the soldiers
JER.51.33	For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, 
JER.51.33	“The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor 
JER.51.33	at the time it is trodden down, 
JER.51.33	just a little while
JER.51.33	and the time of the harvest will come for her.” 
JER.51.34	Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon 
JER.51.34	has devoured me and sucked me dry; 
JER.51.34	he has made me an empty vessel; 
JER.51.34	he has swallowed me like the sea monster; 
JER.51.34	he has filled his belly with my delicacies; 
JER.51.34	he has rinsed me. 
JER.51.35	“May the violence done to me and to my flesh be on Babylon,” 
JER.51.35	the inhabitants
JER.51.35	and “My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,” 
JER.51.35	Jerusalem will say. 
JER.51.36	Therefore
JER.51.36	“Look, I am going to contend your case, 
JER.51.36	and I will avenge your vengeance, 
JER.51.36	and I will cause her sea to dry up, 
JER.51.36	and I will cause her fountain to dry up. 
JER.51.37	And Babylon will become as a heap of stones, 
JER.51.37	a lair of jackals, 
JER.51.37	an object of horror, and an object of hissing, 
JER.51.37	without
JER.51.38	They will roar together like the young lions, 
JER.51.38	they will growl like the cubs of lions. 
JER.51.39	At their becoming hot I will set their banquets, 
JER.51.39	and I will make them drunk, 
JER.51.39	so that they will fall into a swoon, 
JER.51.39	and they will sleep an everlasting sleep,
JER.51.39	and they will not wake up,” declares
JER.51.40	“I will bring them down like young rams to slaughter, 
JER.51.40	like rams and goats. 
JER.51.41	How Sheshach is captured, 
JER.51.41	and the glory of all the earth is seized! 
JER.51.41	How Babylon has become as an object of horror 
JER.51.41	among the nations! 
JER.51.42	The sea has risen over Babylon, 
JER.51.42	she has been covered by the roar of its waves. 
JER.51.43	Her cities have become as an object of horror, 
JER.51.43	a dry land and a wilderness,
JER.51.43	a land in which no person lives, 
JER.51.43	nor does a son of humankind pass through it. 
JER.51.44	And I will punish Bel in Babylon, 
JER.51.44	and I will wrench out from his mouth what he has swallowed.
JER.51.44	And the nations will not stream towards him any longer 
JER.51.44	what’s worse,
JER.51.45	Come out from her midst, my people, 
JER.51.45	and save each one his life 
JER.51.45	from the burning anger of
JER.51.46	Now so that you are not fainthearted,
JER.51.46	and you are afraid at the rumors
JER.51.46	and in the year the rumor comes, 
JER.51.46	and in the year after it the rumor, 
JER.51.46	and violence is in the land, 
JER.51.46	with ruler against ruler— 
JER.51.47	therefore
JER.51.47	and I will punish the images of Babylon, 
JER.51.47	and all her land will be put to shame, 
JER.51.47	and all her slain ones will fall in the midst of her. 
JER.51.48	Then the heaven and the earth and all that is in them 
JER.51.48	will shout for joy over Babylon, 
JER.51.48	for from the north 
JER.51.48	the destroyers will come to it,” declares
JER.51.49	Babylon must fall not only because of the slain ones of Israel, 
JER.51.49	but also because of Babylon the slain ones of all the earth have fallen. 
JER.51.50	Survivors of the sword, go! 
JER.51.50	You must not linger! 
JER.51.50	Remember Yahweh from far away, 
JER.51.50	and let Jerusalem come to your mind.
JER.51.51	We are ashamed, 
JER.51.51	for we have heard taunts,
JER.51.51	disgrace covers our faces, 
JER.51.51	for strangers have come to the holy places of the house of Yahweh. 
JER.51.52	“Therefore
JER.51.52	“and I will punish her images, 
JER.51.52	and the fatally wounded will sigh through all her land. 
JER.51.53	Though Babylon goes up to the heavens, 
JER.51.53	and though she fortifies the high place of her strength, 
JER.51.53	from me destroyers will come to her,” declares
JER.51.54	The sound of a cry for help from Babylon, 
JER.51.54	and a great collapse from the land of the Chaldeans. 
JER.51.55	For Yahweh is devastating Babylon, 
JER.51.55	and he obliterates her loud noise
JER.51.55	Their waves roar like mighty waters, 
JER.51.55	the roar of their voices
JER.51.56	For a destroyer is coming against her, against Babylon, 
JER.51.56	and her warriors are captured. 
JER.51.56	Their bows are broken; 
JER.51.56	for Yahweh is a God of recompense, 
JER.51.56	certainly he will repay. 
JER.51.57	“And I will make drunk her officials, and her wise men, 
JER.51.57	her governors, and her officials, and her warriors, 
JER.51.57	and they will sleep an everlasting sleep,
JER.51.57	and they will not wake up,” 
JER.51.57	declares
JER.51.58	Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 
JER.51.58	“The broad walls of Babylon will be utterly demolished, 
JER.51.58	and her high gates will burn with fire, 
JER.51.58	and the peoples will labor for nothing,
JER.51.58	and the nations for fire,
JER.51.58	and they will grow weary.” 
JER.51.59	The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah, the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, at his going with Zedekiah, the king of Judah, to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was the quartermaster.
JER.51.60	And Jeremiah wrote all the disasters
JER.51.61	And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “At your coming to Babylon, then you must see that you read aloud all these words. 
JER.51.62	And you must say, ‘Yahweh, you yourself spoke against this place, to destroy it, so that there will not be in it anything living, from humankind to animals,
JER.51.63	And then
JER.51.64	And you must say, ‘Babylon will sink, and she will not rise, because of
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old
JER.52.2	And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh like all that Jehoiakim had done. 
JER.52.3	For because of the anger
JER.52.4	And then
JER.52.5	So the city came under siege
JER.52.6	In the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine in the city became severe and there was no food for the people of the land. 
JER.52.7	Then the city was breached, and all the soldiers
JER.52.8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him. 
JER.52.9	Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
JER.52.10	And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah. 
JER.52.11	Then he made blind the eyes of Zedekiah, and they tied him up with bronze fetters, and the king of Babylon brought him to Babylon. And he put him in prison
JER.52.12	Now in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard,
JER.52.13	And he burned the temple
JER.52.14	And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard
JER.52.15	And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard
JER.52.16	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard
JER.52.17	And the Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that were in the temple
JER.52.18	And they took with them the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the sprinkling bowls, and the pans, and all the vessels of bronze which were used in temple service. 
JER.52.19	And the captain of the guard
JER.52.20	The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze oxen that were under the kettle stands which King Solomon had made for the temple
JER.52.21	Now the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits,
JER.52.22	And a capital upon it was bronze and the height of the one capital was five cubits, and latticework and pomegranates were on the capital on all sides, all of bronze. And like these was the second pillar with pomegranates. 
JER.52.23	And there were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides;
JER.52.24	Then the captain of the guard
JER.52.25	And from the city he took one high official who was chief officer over the soldiers,
JER.52.26	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard
JER.52.27	And the king of Babylon struck them down and killed them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah left from its land. 
JER.52.28	This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar deported: in the seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Judeans; 
JER.52.29	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, eight hundred and thirty-two persons
JER.52.30	in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard,
JER.52.31	And then
JER.52.32	Then he spoke with him kindly and gave his seat above the seats
JER.52.33	So he changed the garments of his imprisonment and he ate food before him
JER.52.34	And his allowance, a continual allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon on a daily basis
LAM.1.1	How desolate the city sits 
LAM.1.1	that was full of people! 
LAM.1.1	She has become like a widow, 
LAM.1.1	once great among the nations! 
LAM.1.1	Like a woman of nobility in the provinces, 
LAM.1.1	she has become a forced laborer. 
LAM.1.2	She weeps bitterly in the night, 
LAM.1.2	her tears are on her cheeks; 
LAM.1.2	she has no comforter 
LAM.1.2	among all her lovers. 
LAM.1.2	All her friends have been unfaithful to her; 
LAM.1.2	they have become her enemies. 
LAM.1.3	Judah has gone into exile with misery 
LAM.1.3	and under hard servitude; 
LAM.1.3	she lives among the nations, 
LAM.1.3	she has not found a resting place; 
LAM.1.3	all her pursuers have overtaken her 
LAM.1.3	amidst her distress. 
LAM.1.4	The roads of Zion are mourning 
LAM.1.4	because no one comes to the festival. 
LAM.1.4	All her gates are desolate, 
LAM.1.4	her priests groan; 
LAM.1.4	her young women are worried, 
LAM.1.4	and she herself suffers bitterly. 
LAM.1.5	Her foes have become her master,
LAM.1.5	her enemies are at ease; 
LAM.1.5	Yahweh has made her suffer 
LAM.1.5	because of the greatness of her transgressions. 
LAM.1.5	Her children have gone away, 
LAM.1.5	captive before the foe. 
LAM.1.6	All her majesty has gone away 
LAM.1.6	from the daughter of Zion; 
LAM.1.6	her princes have become like young stags 
LAM.1.6	that have not found pasture; 
LAM.1.6	they have gone away without strength, 
LAM.1.6	before the pursuer. 
LAM.1.7	Jerusalem remembers 
LAM.1.7	the days of her misery and wanderings, 
LAM.1.7	all her treasures 
LAM.1.7	that were from the days of long ago. 
LAM.1.7	When her people fell into the hand of the enemy, 
LAM.1.7	there was no one helping her; 
LAM.1.7	the enemies saw her, they mocked 
LAM.1.7	at her destruction. 
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem sinned grievously, 
LAM.1.8	thus she became an objection of derision; 
LAM.1.8	all those who honored her despise her 
LAM.1.8	because they have seen her nakedness. 
LAM.1.8	She herself groans 
LAM.1.8	and turns away. 
LAM.1.9	Her uncleanness was in her skirts; 
LAM.1.9	she did not remember her future, 
LAM.1.9	she has descended beyond understanding, 
LAM.1.9	there is no comforter for her. 
LAM.1.9	See, O Yahweh, my persecution! 
LAM.1.9	My enemy has been made great! 
LAM.1.10	The enemy has stretched out his hand 
LAM.1.10	over all her treasures; 
LAM.1.10	for she has seen the nations, 
LAM.1.10	they entered her sanctuary, 
LAM.1.10	those whom you commanded not to enter 
LAM.1.10	in your assembly. 
LAM.1.11	All her people groan, 
LAM.1.11	they are searching for bread. 
LAM.1.11	They give their treasures for food, 
LAM.1.11	to bring back life. 
LAM.1.11	See, O Yahweh, and look, 
LAM.1.11	how I am despised. 
LAM.1.12	Is it nothing to you, all who pass by?
LAM.1.12	Look and see 
LAM.1.12	if there is sorrow like my sorrow,
LAM.1.12	which was dealt to me, 
LAM.1.12	which Yahweh inflicted 
LAM.1.12	on the day of his wrath.
LAM.1.13	From heaven he sent fire, 
LAM.1.13	into my bones he let it descend. 
LAM.1.13	He spread out a net for my feet; 
LAM.1.13	he turned me back, 
LAM.1.13	he gave me devastation, 
LAM.1.13	fainting all day. 
LAM.1.14	My rebellion was bound as a yoke, 
LAM.1.14	with his hand it was fastened together; 
LAM.1.14	it was put on my neck 
LAM.1.14	and caused my strength to fail. 
LAM.1.14	The Lord gave me into the hands 
LAM.1.14	of those whom I cannot withstand. 
LAM.1.15	The Lord has rejected 
LAM.1.15	all my mighty ones in my midst. 
LAM.1.15	He called an assembly against me, 
LAM.1.15	to crush my young men; 
LAM.1.15	like in a wine press, 
LAM.1.15	the Lord has trodden on 
LAM.1.15	the virgin daughter of Judah. 
LAM.1.16	For these things, I am weeping, 
LAM.1.16	my eyes flow with tears;
LAM.1.16	because a comforter is far from me, 
LAM.1.16	one to restore my life. 
LAM.1.16	My sons are desolate 
LAM.1.16	because the enemy has prevailed. 
LAM.1.17	Zion stretches out her hands; 
LAM.1.17	there is no one to comfort her. 
LAM.1.17	Yahweh has commanded against Jacob, 
LAM.1.17	that those surrounding him
LAM.1.17	Jerusalem has become 
LAM.1.17	a defilement among them. 
LAM.1.18	Yahweh is righteous; 
LAM.1.18	I have rebelled against his word.
LAM.1.18	Please hear, all the nations, 
LAM.1.18	And see my pain; 
LAM.1.18	My young women
LAM.1.18	went into captivity. 
LAM.1.19	I have called to my lovers, 
LAM.1.19	they themselves deceived me; 
LAM.1.19	my priests and elders perished in the city 
LAM.1.19	when they sought food for themselves 
LAM.1.19	to revive their life.
LAM.1.20	See, O Yahweh, that I am in distress;
LAM.1.20	my stomach
LAM.1.20	my heart has turned inside me 
LAM.1.20	because I have certainly rebelled. 
LAM.1.20	From outside a sword brings bereavement, 
LAM.1.20	inside the house it is like death. 
LAM.1.21	They hear that I was groaning; 
LAM.1.21	there is no comforter for me. 
LAM.1.21	All my enemies have heard my misery, 
LAM.1.21	they are pleased that you have done it. 
LAM.1.21	Bring that day that you have proclaimed,
LAM.1.21	And let them be like me. 
LAM.1.22	Let all their evil come before you; 
LAM.1.22	and deal with them 
LAM.1.22	just as you have dealt with me 
LAM.1.22	because of all my crimes; 
LAM.1.22	for my groaning is much and my heart is faint. 
LAM.2.1	How, in his anger,
LAM.2.1	the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion in a cloud! 
LAM.2.1	He has thrown down from heavens to earth 
LAM.2.1	the splendor of Israel, 
LAM.2.1	and he has not remembered his footstool 
LAM.2.1	in the day of his anger.
LAM.2.2	The Lord has devoured; he has not shown mercy 
LAM.2.2	to all the dwellings of Jacob; 
LAM.2.2	he has broken down in his wrath 
LAM.2.2	the fortifications of the daughter of Judah; 
LAM.2.2	he has leveled to the ground, he has dishonored 
LAM.2.2	the kingdom and its commanders.
LAM.2.3	He has cut down in fierce anger
LAM.2.3	all the might of Israel; 
LAM.2.3	he has withdrawn his right hand 
LAM.2.3	from the faces of the enemy, 
LAM.2.3	and he has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire, 
LAM.2.3	it has consumed all around. 
LAM.2.4	He has bent his bow like an enemy; 
LAM.2.4	he has set his right hand 
LAM.2.4	like a foe, and he has slain 
LAM.2.4	all the treasures of the eye;
LAM.2.4	in the tent of the daughter of Zion, 
LAM.2.4	he has poured out his anger like fire. 
LAM.2.5	The Lord has become like an enemy; 
LAM.2.5	he has destroyed Israel; 
LAM.2.5	he has destroyed all its citadel fortresses;
LAM.2.5	he has ruined all its fortifications 
LAM.2.5	and multiplied lamentation and mourning 
LAM.2.5	in the daughter of Judah. 
LAM.2.6	He has broken down his dwelling
LAM.2.6	he has ruined his appointed feasts; 
LAM.2.6	Yahweh has made them forget in Zion 
LAM.2.6	festival
LAM.2.6	and he has despised in his anger 
LAM.2.6	king and priest. 
LAM.2.7	The Lord has rejected his altar; 
LAM.2.7	he has rejected his sanctuary; 
LAM.2.7	he has delivered into the hands of the enemy 
LAM.2.7	the walls of its citadel fortresses.
LAM.2.7	They have cried out in the house of Yahweh 
LAM.2.7	like a day of an appointed feast. 
LAM.2.8	Yahweh has planned to destroy 
LAM.2.8	the wall of the daughter of Zion. 
LAM.2.8	He measured with a line; he has not restrained 
LAM.2.8	his hand from destroying; 
LAM.2.8	he caused rampart and wall to mourn; 
LAM.2.8	together they have languished away. 
LAM.2.9	Her gates have sunk into the earth; 
LAM.2.9	he has ruined and broken her bars, 
LAM.2.9	her kings and its princes are among the nations; 
LAM.2.9	there is no more law.
LAM.2.9	Also, her prophets have not found 
LAM.2.9	a revelation from Yahweh. 
LAM.2.10	They sit on the ground, 
LAM.2.10	the elders of the daughter of Zion are silent. 
LAM.2.10	They cast dust on their head, 
LAM.2.10	they have put on sackcloth; 
LAM.2.10	the young women of Jerusalem 
LAM.2.10	have bowed their head down to the ground. 
LAM.2.11	My eyes have spent all their tears;
LAM.2.11	my stomach
LAM.2.11	my heart
LAM.2.11	because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, 
LAM.2.11	because child and babe faint 
LAM.2.11	in the public squares of a city. 
LAM.2.12	To their mothers they say, 
LAM.2.12	“Where is the bread and wine?” 
LAM.2.12	as they faint like the wounded 
LAM.2.12	in the public squares of a city, 
LAM.2.12	as their life is being poured out 
LAM.2.12	onto the bosom of their mothers. 
LAM.2.13	What can I say for you? What can I compare to you, 
LAM.2.13	O daughter of Jerusalem? 
LAM.2.13	To what can I liken you so that I can comfort you, 
LAM.2.13	O virgin daughter of Zion? 
LAM.2.13	For your destruction is as vast as the sea; 
LAM.2.13	who can heal you? 
LAM.2.14	Your prophets had a vision for you, 
LAM.2.14	false and worthless; 
LAM.2.14	they have not exposed your sin, 
LAM.2.14	to restore your fortune; 
LAM.2.14	they have seen oracles for you, 
LAM.2.14	false and misleading. 
LAM.2.15	They clap hands over you, 
LAM.2.15	all who pass along the way; 
LAM.2.15	they hiss and they shake their head, 
LAM.2.15	at the daughter of Jerusalem. 
LAM.2.15	Is this the city of which it is said, 
LAM.2.15	“A perfection of beauty, a joy for all the earth?” 
LAM.2.16	They have opened their mouths against you, 
LAM.2.16	all your enemies. 
LAM.2.16	They hiss and gnash a tooth, 
LAM.2.16	and they say, “We have destroyed her! 
LAM.2.16	Surely this is the day we have hoped for; 
LAM.2.16	we have found it, we have seen it!” 
LAM.2.17	Yahweh has done what he has planned; 
LAM.2.17	he has fulfilled his promise 
LAM.2.17	that he ordained from the days of old; 
LAM.2.17	he has demolished and not shown mercy; 
LAM.2.17	he has made an enemy rejoice over you, 
LAM.2.17	he has exalted the might
LAM.2.18	Their heart cried to the Lord, 
LAM.2.18	“O wall of the daughter of Zion, 
LAM.2.18	let tears stream down like a river; 
LAM.2.18	day and night, 
LAM.2.18	do not give yourself relief, 
LAM.2.18	do not give your eyes rest. 
LAM.2.19	“Arise, cry out in the night, 
LAM.2.19	at the beginning of the night watches; 
LAM.2.19	pour out your heart like water, 
LAM.2.19	before the face of the Lord. 
LAM.2.19	Lift to him your hands, 
LAM.2.19	for the life of your children, 
LAM.2.19	who faint in starvation, 
LAM.2.19	at the head of all streets.” 
LAM.2.20	See, Yahweh, and take note! 
LAM.2.20	With whom have you dealt thus? 
LAM.2.20	Should women eat their young 
LAM.2.20	children of tender care? 
LAM.2.20	Should priest and prophet be slain 
LAM.2.20	in the sanctuary of the Lord? 
LAM.2.21	They lie in the soil of the streets, 
LAM.2.21	young and old; 
LAM.2.21	my young women
LAM.2.21	they have fallen by the sword; 
LAM.2.21	you have slain on the day of your anger,
LAM.2.21	you have slaughtered and not shown mercy. 
LAM.2.22	You have summoned my horror from all around, 
LAM.2.22	as if for a feast day; 
LAM.2.22	no one on the day of Yahweh’s anger 
LAM.2.22	is a fugitive and a survivor; 
LAM.2.22	whoever I have cared for and reared, 
LAM.2.22	my enemy has destroyed. 
LAM.3.1	I am a man who has seen misery, 
LAM.3.1	under the rod of his wrath. 
LAM.3.2	He has driven me along, he brought 
LAM.3.2	darkness and not light. 
LAM.3.3	Surely he has turned his hand against me, 
LAM.3.3	all day long. 
LAM.3.4	He has worn out my flesh and skin, 
LAM.3.4	he has broken my bones. 
LAM.3.5	He has besieged
LAM.3.5	with bitterness and hardship. 
LAM.3.6	In darkness he has let me dwell 
LAM.3.6	like the dead of long ago. 
LAM.3.7	He has built a wall around me, I cannot go out; 
LAM.3.7	he has made my bronze fetters heavy. 
LAM.3.8	Though I cry out for help, 
LAM.3.8	he shuts out my prayers. 
LAM.3.9	He has blocked my ways with dressed stones; 
LAM.3.9	he has made my paths crooked. 
LAM.3.10	To me he is like a bear lying in wait, 
LAM.3.10	a lion in hiding. 
LAM.3.11	He has forsaken my way and torn me to pieces; 
LAM.3.11	he has caused me desolation. 
LAM.3.12	He has bent his bow and set me 
LAM.3.12	as the target for the arrow. 
LAM.3.13	He shot the arrows of his quiver
LAM.3.13	into my kidneys. 
LAM.3.14	I have become a laughingstock for all the people, 
LAM.3.14	their mocking song all day long. 
LAM.3.15	He has filled me with bitterness, 
LAM.3.15	he has drenched me with wormwood. 
LAM.3.16	He has broken my teeth on grit, 
LAM.3.16	he has trampled me down in ash. 
LAM.3.17	My life has been removed from peace, 
LAM.3.17	I have forgotten goodness. 
LAM.3.18	And I have said, “My glory is ruined, 
LAM.3.18	my expectation from Yahweh.” 
LAM.3.19	Remember my misery and bitterness, 
LAM.3.19	the wormwood
LAM.3.20	Surely my soul remembers 
LAM.3.20	and bows down within me. 
LAM.3.21	This I have reminded myself,
LAM.3.21	therefore I will hope. 
LAM.3.22	The loyal love of Yahweh does not cease; 
LAM.3.22	his compassions do not come to an end. 
LAM.3.23	They are new in the morning, 
LAM.3.23	great is your faithfulness. 
LAM.3.24	“Yahweh is my portion,” 
LAM.3.24	says my soul, 
LAM.3.24	“Thus I will hope on him.” 
LAM.3.25	Yahweh is good to those who wait on him, 
LAM.3.25	to the person that seeks him. 
LAM.3.26	It is good to wait in silence 
LAM.3.26	for the salvation of Yahweh. 
LAM.3.27	It is good for a man who carries 
LAM.3.27	the yoke of his childhood. 
LAM.3.28	Let him sit alone and be silent 
LAM.3.28	when he
LAM.3.29	Let him put
LAM.3.29	perhaps there is hope. 
LAM.3.30	Let him give a cheek to his smiter, 
LAM.3.30	let him be filled with disgrace. 
LAM.3.31	For the Lord will not reject 
LAM.3.31	forever. 
LAM.3.32	For even though he causes grief he has compassion 
LAM.3.32	according to the greatness of his royal love. 
LAM.3.33	He does not afflict willingly,
LAM.3.33	or grieve anyone.
LAM.3.34	To crush under his feet 
LAM.3.34	all the prisoners of the earth; 
LAM.3.35	to deprive one of justice
LAM.3.35	before the face of the Most High; 
LAM.3.36	to subvert a person in a legal dispute 
LAM.3.36	—the Lord has not found delight in these things. 
LAM.3.37	Who can speak
LAM.3.37	if the Lord has not commanded it? 
LAM.3.38	Is it not from the mouth of the Most High 
LAM.3.38	that disaster and good will come? 
LAM.3.39	Why should any living person complain 
LAM.3.39	about his sin? 
LAM.3.40	Let us test and examine our ways; 
LAM.3.40	let us return to Yahweh. 
LAM.3.41	Let us lift up our hearts with our hands 
LAM.3.41	to God in the heavens. 
LAM.3.42	We ourselves have transgressed and rebelled, 
LAM.3.42	you have not forgiven. 
LAM.3.43	You have covered yourself in anger
LAM.3.43	you have slain and not shown mercy. 
LAM.3.44	You have covered yourself in a cloud 
LAM.3.44	so that prayer cannot pass through.
LAM.3.45	You have made us scum and refuse 
LAM.3.45	in the midst of the nations. 
LAM.3.46	All our enemies 
LAM.3.46	have opened their mouth against us. 
LAM.3.47	Fear and a pit have come upon us, 
LAM.3.47	desolation and destruction. 
LAM.3.48	Channels of water run down my eyes 
LAM.3.48	because of the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
LAM.3.49	My eyes have poured down unceasingly 
LAM.3.49	without respite, 
LAM.3.50	until Yahweh looks down 
LAM.3.50	and sees from heaven. 
LAM.3.51	My eyes inflict my soul 
LAM.3.51	because of all the daughters of my city. 
LAM.3.52	My enemies hunt me without cause, 
LAM.3.52	like a bird. 
LAM.3.53	They have silenced me in a pit,
LAM.3.53	they have thrown a stone at me. 
LAM.3.54	Water has flown over my head, 
LAM.3.54	I said, “I am cut off.” 
LAM.3.55	I have called your name, O Yahweh, 
LAM.3.55	from the depths of the pit. 
LAM.3.56	You have heard my cry, “Do not shut your ear 
LAM.3.56	to my cry for help, for my relief!” 
LAM.3.57	You came near on a day when I called you, 
LAM.3.57	you said, “Do not fear!” 
LAM.3.58	O Lord, you have pleaded for my cause,
LAM.3.58	you have redeemed my life. 
LAM.3.59	You have seen my injustice, O Yahweh; 
LAM.3.59	judge my case. 
LAM.3.60	You have seen all their vengeance, 
LAM.3.60	all there plans against me. 
LAM.3.61	You have heard their disgrace, O Yahweh, 
LAM.3.61	all their plans against me. 
LAM.3.62	The lips and meditation of my assailants 
LAM.3.62	are against me all day long. 
LAM.3.63	Look at their sitting and their standing, 
LAM.3.63	I am their mocking song. 
LAM.3.64	Return to them what is deserved, O Yahweh, 
LAM.3.64	according to the work of their hands. 
LAM.3.65	Give them a stubborn heart; 
LAM.3.65	curse them! 
LAM.3.66	Pursue them in anger
LAM.3.66	from under the heavens of Yahweh. 
LAM.4.1	How the gold has grown dim, 
LAM.4.1	the pure gold has changed. 
LAM.4.1	The stones of holiness are scattered 
LAM.4.1	at the head of every street. 
LAM.4.2	The precious sons of Zion 
LAM.4.2	weighed against fine gold, 
LAM.4.2	how they are thought of as earthen vessels of clay, 
LAM.4.2	the work of the potter’s hands. 
LAM.4.3	Even the jackal bears the beast 
LAM.4.3	and nurses their cubs; 
LAM.4.3	but the daughter of my people has become ruthless, 
LAM.4.3	like ostriches in the wilderness. 
LAM.4.4	The tongue of the nursling cleaves 
LAM.4.4	to its palate in thirst. 
LAM.4.4	Children beg for food, 
LAM.4.4	no one lays it out before them.
LAM.4.5	The ones who eat delicacies, 
LAM.4.5	they are ruined in the streets; 
LAM.4.5	the ones nurtured in purple 
LAM.4.5	lie on piles of trash. 
LAM.4.6	The iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater 
LAM.4.6	than the sin of Sodom; 
LAM.4.6	it was overthrown in a moment 
LAM.4.6	and no hands were laid on her. 
LAM.4.7	Her princes were purer than snow, 
LAM.4.7	they were whiter than milk; 
LAM.4.7	their bodies were more ruddy than rubies, 
LAM.4.7	sapphire their appearance. 
LAM.4.8	Now their appearance is blacker than soot, 
LAM.4.8	they are not recognized in the streets; 
LAM.4.8	their skin has shriveled on their bones, 
LAM.4.8	it has become dry like wood. 
LAM.4.9	Happier were the victims of the sword 
LAM.4.9	than the victims of famine; 
LAM.4.9	they have pined away, very hungry 
LAM.4.9	for the crops of my field. 
LAM.4.10	The hands of compassionate women, 
LAM.4.10	have cooked their children; 
LAM.4.10	they became as something to eat 
LAM.4.10	in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
LAM.4.11	Yahweh has completed his anger, 
LAM.4.11	he has poured out his fierce anger;
LAM.4.11	he has kindled a fire in Zion, 
LAM.4.11	it consumed her
LAM.4.12	The kings of the earth did not believe, 
LAM.4.12	and all the inhabitants of the world, 
LAM.4.12	that a foe and an enemy could enter 
LAM.4.12	into the gates of Jerusalem. 
LAM.4.13	Because of the sins of her prophets, 
LAM.4.13	the guilt of her priests, 
LAM.4.13	who shed blood in her midst, 
LAM.4.13	of righteous people. 
LAM.4.14	They wander blindly in the streets; 
LAM.4.14	they were defiled with the blood, 
LAM.4.14	their clothes 
LAM.4.14	could not be touched. 
LAM.4.15	“Go away! Defiled!” they shout to them. 
LAM.4.15	“Go away! Go away! Do not touch!” 
LAM.4.15	so they left, they left; it was said among the nations, 
LAM.4.15	“They will no longer dwell with us.”
LAM.4.16	The presence of Yahweh has scattered them, 
LAM.4.16	he will no longer watch over them; 
LAM.4.16	they did not honor the priests,
LAM.4.16	they did not show mercy to elders. 
LAM.4.17	Still our eyes failed, 
LAM.4.17	looking for our help in vain; 
LAM.4.17	in our watchtower, we kept watch 
LAM.4.17	for a nation that could not save. 
LAM.4.18	They hunted our steps, 
LAM.4.18	from walking in our streets; 
LAM.4.18	our end has come near, our days are finished,
LAM.4.18	our end has come. 
LAM.4.19	Our pursuers were swifter 
LAM.4.19	than the eagles of the heavens; 
LAM.4.19	they chased us on the mountains, 
LAM.4.19	they have set an ambush for us in the desert. 
LAM.4.20	The breath of our nostrils, the anointed one of Yahweh, 
LAM.4.20	was captured in their pits; 
LAM.4.20	of whom we said, “In his shadow 
LAM.4.20	we will live among the nations.” 
LAM.4.21	Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, 
LAM.4.21	you who dwell in the land of Uz; 
LAM.4.21	but to you also the cup will pass, 
LAM.4.21	you will become drunk and strip yourself bare. 
LAM.4.22	The punishment of your iniquity is completed, O daughter of Zion, 
LAM.4.22	your exile will not continue; 
LAM.4.22	but he will punish your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, 
LAM.4.22	he will reveal your sins. 
LAM.5.1	Remember, O Yahweh, what has become of us; 
LAM.5.1	take note, and see our disgrace! 
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, 
LAM.5.2	our houses, to foreigners. 
LAM.5.3	We have become orphans, fatherless, 
LAM.5.3	our mothers are like widows. 
LAM.5.4	We pay for water with money,
LAM.5.4	our wood comes to us at a price. 
LAM.5.5	We are driven on our necks; 
LAM.5.5	we are weary, there is no rest for us. 
LAM.5.6	We have made a deal with Egypt and Assyria 
LAM.5.6	to be satisfied with food. 
LAM.5.7	Our fathers have sinned, they are no more; 
LAM.5.7	we bear their iniquity. 
LAM.5.8	Slaves rule over us; 
LAM.5.8	there is no one to deliver us from their hand. 
LAM.5.9	We risk our life for food
LAM.5.9	because of the sword of the desert. 
LAM.5.10	Our skin is hot like an oven 
LAM.5.10	because of the scorching famine. 
LAM.5.11	They raped women in Zion, 
LAM.5.11	young women
LAM.5.12	They hang princes by their hand; 
LAM.5.12	they do not show respect before elders. 
LAM.5.13	Young men must carry a hand-mill 
LAM.5.13	and boys stumble under the wood. 
LAM.5.14	Elders are no longer at the gate, 
LAM.5.14	young men no longer play stringed instruments. 
LAM.5.15	The joy of our hearts has stopped; 
LAM.5.15	our circle-dancing has changed to a mourning ceremony. 
LAM.5.16	The crown has fallen from our head; 
LAM.5.16	woe to us, for we have sinned! 
LAM.5.17	Because of this, our heart has become faint, 
LAM.5.17	because of these, our eyes have become dim. 
LAM.5.18	Because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate, 
LAM.5.18	foxes tread on it.
LAM.5.19	You, O Yahweh, will sit forever 
LAM.5.19	on your throne for generation to generation. 
LAM.5.20	Why have you forgotten us forever? 
LAM.5.20	Why have you forsaken us for so long?
LAM.5.21	Restore us to you, O Yahweh, that we will be restored; 
LAM.5.21	renew our days as of old. 
LAM.5.22	Unless you have utterly rejected us, 
LAM.5.22	unless you are angry with us beyond measure. 
EZK.1.1	And it was in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, and I was in the midst of
EZK.1.2	On the fifth day of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of the king Jehoiachin— 
EZK.1.3	the word of Yahweh came
EZK.1.4	And I looked,
EZK.1.5	And from its midst
EZK.1.6	and each had four faces,
EZK.1.7	And their legs were straight legs, and the sole of their feet was like the sole of the foot of a calf, and they were sparkling like the outward appearance of polished bronze. 
EZK.1.8	And under their wings were human hands
EZK.1.9	their wings were touching one another;
EZK.1.10	The likeness of their faces was the face of a human in front, and the face of a lion on the right of each of them,
EZK.1.11	So were their faces; their wings were spread out upward;
EZK.1.12	And each went straight forward;
EZK.1.13	As for
EZK.1.14	And the living creatures were speeding to and fro
EZK.1.15	And I saw the living creatures, and look! A wheel was on the earth
EZK.1.16	The appearance of the wheels and their construction was like the appearance of beryl,
EZK.1.17	When they moved, they went toward their four sides; they did not veer at all as they went.
EZK.1.18	And their rims were high and awesome,
EZK.1.19	And at the going of the living creatures, the wheels next to them also went, and when the creatures were lifted from the ground
EZK.1.20	Wherever
EZK.1.21	At their
EZK.1.22	Now
EZK.1.23	And under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight one toward the other;
EZK.1.24	And I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the voice of Shaddai,
EZK.1.25	And there was
EZK.1.26	And from above the expanse that was above their heads there was the likeness of a throne, looking like a sapphire,
EZK.1.27	And I saw something like the outward appearance of amber, something like the appearance of fire, with a covering around it, from the likeness of his loins and upward.
EZK.1.28	Like the appearance
EZK.2.1	And he said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.2.2	And the Spirit
EZK.2.3	And he said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.2.4	And the children
EZK.2.5	And they, whether they listen or whether they fail to listen, for they are a rebellious house, they will know that a prophet was in their midst. 
EZK.2.6	And you, son of man,
EZK.2.7	And you must speak my words to them whether they listen or whether they fail to listen, for they are rebellious. 
EZK.2.8	And you, son of man,
EZK.2.9	And I looked,
EZK.2.10	And he rolled it out
EZK.3.1	 And he said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.3.2	And I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat, 
EZK.3.3	and he said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.3.4	And he said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.3.5	For you are sent to the house of Israel, not to a people of obscure speech
EZK.3.6	and not to many nations of obscure speech
EZK.3.7	And the house of Israel, they are not willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me, for all of the house of Israel is hard of forehead, and they are hard of heart. 
EZK.3.8	But look, I have made
EZK.3.9	Like a diamond harder than flint
EZK.3.10	And he said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.3.11	And come, go to the exiles,
EZK.3.12	And the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake when the glory of Yahweh rose from its place. 
EZK.3.13	And it was the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching lightly
EZK.3.14	And the Spirit lifted me and took me, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me. 
EZK.3.15	And I went to the exiles
EZK.3.16	And then it happened
EZK.3.17	“Son of man,
EZK.3.18	When I say
EZK.3.19	And you, if you do warn the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness and from his wicked way, on account of his guilt he will die, and you yourself will have saved your life.
EZK.3.20	And when the righteous turns from his righteousness
EZK.3.21	And if you warn him, the righteous, not to sin, and the righteous does not sin, surely he will live, for he heeded a warning. And you will have saved your life.”
EZK.3.22	And the hand of Yahweh was on me there, and he said to me, “Rise up, go out to the valley, and there I will speak with you.” 
EZK.3.23	And I rose up, and I went to the valley, and, look, there the glory of Yahweh was standing, like the glory that I saw near the Kebar River,
EZK.3.24	And the Spirit
EZK.3.25	and you, son of man,
EZK.3.26	And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, and you will be silenced, and you will not be a reproving man for them, for they are a rebellious house.
EZK.3.27	And when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “The one hearing him, let him hear, and the one failing to hear, let him fail,” ’ for they are a rebellious house.
EZK.4.1	“Now,
EZK.4.2	And you must build against it siege works, and you must build against it a bulwark, and you must heap against it a siege ramp, and you must set up against it camps and put against it a battering ram all around. 
EZK.4.3	And take for yourself a plate of iron, and you must place it as a wall of iron between you and the city, and you must set your face against it, and it must be under siege,
EZK.4.4	And you, lie down on your left side, and you must put
EZK.4.5	And I will give to you the years of their guilt according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days, and you must bear the guilt
EZK.4.6	When you have completed these, then you must lie a second time on your right side; and you must bear the guilt
EZK.4.7	And toward the siege of Jerusalem you must set your face and your bared arm; then you must prophesy against it. 
EZK.4.8	Now
EZK.4.9	“And you, take for yourself
EZK.4.10	And your food that you will eat
EZK.4.11	And an amount of water
EZK.4.12	And as a bread-cake of barley you shall eat it, and with human excrement
EZK.4.13	And Yahweh said, “Thus shall the Israelites
EZK.4.14	And I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Look! I have not been defiling myself, and a dead body and mangled carcass I have not eaten from my childhood until now, and unclean meat
EZK.4.15	And he said to me, “See I will give you cattle manure
EZK.4.16	And he said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.4.17	so that they will lack food and water, and they will be appalled with one another,
EZK.5.1	 “And you, son of man,
EZK.5.2	A third you must burn with fire in the midst
EZK.5.3	And you must take from these a few in number, and you must tuck them in your hem. 
EZK.5.4	And from them again you shall take some, and you must throw them in the middle of the fire, and you must burn them with fire; from it a fire will go out to all of the house of Israel. 
EZK.5.5	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: This is Jerusalem in the midst of the nations where I have put her, and countries are around her. 
EZK.5.6	But she has rebelled against my regulations to the point of wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are around her; for they rejected my regulations, and as for my statutes, they did not walk in them. 
EZK.5.7	Therefore, thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because of your commotion more than the nations that are around you—you did not walk in my statutes, and you did not do my regulations, and according to the regulations of the nations that are around you, you did not do. 
EZK.5.8	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Look! I, even I,
EZK.5.9	and I will do with you that which I have not done, and which I will not do again, because of all of your detestable things. 
EZK.5.10	Therefore
EZK.5.11	Therefore as surely as I live,
EZK.5.12	A third of you will die because of the plague, and because of the famine they will perish in the midst of you, and a third will fall through the sword around you, and a third I will scatter to every direction of the wind, and I will draw the sword behind them. 
EZK.5.13	And my anger will come to an end, and I will place my rage on them, and I will relent, and they will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my passion when I fully vent my rage against them.
EZK.5.14	And I will make you into a desolate place and into a disgrace among the nations that surround you before the eyes of every one who passes by.
EZK.5.15	And it will be
EZK.5.16	When I send my arrows of deadly famine against them, which will be as destruction that I will send in order to destroy you, I will increase famine against you, and I will break the supply of food
EZK.5.17	And I will send against you famine and fierce animals,
EZK.6.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.6.2	“Son of man,
EZK.6.3	and you must say, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh, thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains and to the hills, to the ravines and to the valleys: “Look, I am bringing upon you the sword, and I will destroy your high places, 
EZK.6.4	and your altars will be desolate, and your incense altars will be broken, and I will throw down your slain ones before
EZK.6.5	and I will place
EZK.6.6	In all of your dwellings, the cities will be desolate and the high places will be ruined, so that your altars will be desolate and will suffer punishment. Your idols will be broken and will come to an end, and your incense altars will be cut down, and your works will be destroyed, 
EZK.6.7	and the slain one will fall in the midst of you, and then you will know that I am Yahweh. 
EZK.6.8	But
EZK.6.9	And your fugitives will remember me among the nations to which they were taken captive, that I was shattered by their adulterous heart
EZK.6.10	And they will know that I am Yahweh; not in vain
EZK.6.11	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Clap your hand and stamp with your foot, and say, “Alas, for all of the detestable things of the evil of the house of Israel, because of which
EZK.6.12	The one who is far away will die by the plague, and the one who is near will fall by the sword, and the one who is being left behind and being spared will die by the famine, and I will complete my rage on
EZK.6.13	And you will know that I am Yahweh when their slain ones are in the midst of their idols
EZK.6.14	And I will stretch out my hand against them, and I will make the land a desolation and a wasteland from the desert to Riblah in all of their dwellings, and they will know that I am Yahweh.” ’ ” 
EZK.7.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.7.2	“And you, son of man,
EZK.7.3	Now the end is on you, and I will send my anger on you, and I will judge you according to your ways, and I will bring on you all your detestable things. 
EZK.7.4	And my eye will not take pity on you, and I will not show compassion for your ways; on you I will bring your detestable things; they will be in the midst of you, and you will know that I am Yahweh.’ 
EZK.7.5	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Look! Disaster after disaster is coming! 
EZK.7.6	The end comes, comes the end! It has awakened against you! Look! It comes! 
EZK.7.7	Doom is coming against you, the dweller
EZK.7.8	Soon
EZK.7.9	And my eye will not take pity, and I will not show compassion. According to your ways I will deal with you,
EZK.7.10	Look! The day is coming; doom goes out, the staff blossoms, pride sprouts. 
EZK.7.11	Violence has grown to become a staff of wickedness; none
EZK.7.12	The time has come, the day has arrived; let not the buyer rejoice, and let the seller not mourn, for anger is on all their multitude. 
EZK.7.13	For the seller will not return to the merchandise while they are still alive,
EZK.7.14	They shall blow on the trumpet and prepare everything,
EZK.7.15	The sword is outside,
EZK.7.16	And if their survivors will escape, they will be on the mountains, like the doves of the valley, all of them groaning, each because of his guilt. 
EZK.7.17	All of the hands will hang limp, and all of the knees will be wet with urine.
EZK.7.18	And they will wear sackcloth, and horror will cover them, and on all of the faces will be shame, and baldness on all of their heads. 
EZK.7.19	Their silver they will discard on the streets, and filth will be their gold; their silver and their gold will not be able to rescue them on the day of the wrath of Yahweh. They will not satisfy their hunger
EZK.7.20	“ ‘And the beauty of its
EZK.7.21	And I will give it into the hand of strangers as plunder and to the wicked people of the earth as spoil, and they will defile it. 
EZK.7.22	And I will turn my face from them, and they will defile my treasured place, and violent ones will enter and defile it. 
EZK.7.23	Make a chain for the land; it is full of bloody crimes
EZK.7.24	And I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will take possession of their houses, and I will put to an end the pride of the mighty ones, and their sanctuaries will be defiled. 
EZK.7.25	Anguish comes, and they will seek peace, and there will be none. 
EZK.7.26	Calamity upon calamity will come, and rumor will be upon rumor. And they will seek a vision from a prophet, but instruction will perish from the priest and counsel from the elders. 
EZK.7.27	The king will mourn, and the prince will be dressed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. According to their way I will do to
EZK.8.1	And then
EZK.8.2	and I saw,
EZK.8.3	And he sent out the form of a hand, and he took me by a lock of hair of my head, and the Spirit lifted me between earth and heaven, and it brought me to Jerusalem in visions of God to the doorway of the inner gate that faced north,
EZK.8.4	And look! There was the glory of the God of Israel like the vision that I saw in the valley. 
EZK.8.5	And he said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.8.6	And he said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.8.7	And he brought me to the doorway of the courtyard, and I saw, and look! A hole in the wall. 
EZK.8.8	And he said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.8.9	And he said to me, “Come and see the detestable things, the evil that they are doing
EZK.8.10	And I came, and I saw, and look, all kinds of creatures
EZK.8.11	And seventy men from the elders of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan, was standing in the midst of them, and they were standing before them.
EZK.8.12	And he said to me, “Have you seen, son of man,
EZK.8.13	And he said to me, “Still you will see again
EZK.8.14	And he brought me to the doorway of the gate of the house of Yahweh that is toward the north, and look! There were the women sitting weeping for Tammuz. 
EZK.8.15	And he said to me, “Have you seen, son of man?
EZK.8.16	And he brought me to the inner courtyard of the house of Yahweh, and look, at the doorway of the temple of Yahweh, between the portico and the altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of Yahweh and their faces toward the east, and they were bowing down toward the east before the sun. 
EZK.8.17	And he said to me, “Have you seen, son of man?
EZK.8.18	And so I will act in rage, and my eye will not take pity, and I will not have compassion, and they will cry in my ear with a loud voice, and I will not hear them.” 
EZK.9.1	And he called in my ears with a loud voice, saying,
EZK.9.2	And look! Six men coming from the way of the upper gate
EZK.9.3	And the glory of the God of Israel lifted itself up from upon the cherub that he was on
EZK.9.4	And Yahweh said to him, “Go through in the midst of the city, in the midst of Jerusalem, and you must place a mark on the foreheads of the men who are groaning and lamenting
EZK.9.5	And to the others he said in my hearing, “Go through the city behind him and kill! Your eyes shall not take pity, and you shall not have compassion. 
EZK.9.6	You must kill totally
EZK.9.7	And he said to them, “Defile the house
EZK.9.8	And then
EZK.9.9	And he said to me, “The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly
EZK.9.10	And I, my eye will not take pity, and I will not have compassion; their way I will bring on their head.” 
EZK.9.11	And look! The man clothed in linen and with a writing case at his side
EZK.10.1	And I looked, and look! On the expanse that was above the head of the cherubim something like a stone of sapphire,
EZK.10.2	And he spoke
EZK.10.3	Now
EZK.10.4	And the glory of Yahweh rose up from on the cherub toward
EZK.10.5	And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as
EZK.10.6	And then at his command
EZK.10.7	Then the cherub stretched out his hand from among
EZK.10.8	And there appeared for
EZK.10.9	And I saw, and look, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub,
EZK.10.10	Their appearance
EZK.10.11	When they went
EZK.10.12	And their whole body,
EZK.10.13	Concerning the wheels, he was calling them “the wheelwork” in my hearing.
EZK.10.14	And each one had four faces;
EZK.10.15	And the cherubim rose; that is, the living creatures
EZK.10.16	And when the cherubim went,
EZK.10.17	When they stood,
EZK.10.18	And the glory of Yahweh went out from
EZK.10.19	And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and they rose from the earth before my eyes. At their going out, the wheels were
EZK.10.20	This was
EZK.10.21	Each one had four faces,
EZK.10.22	And the likeness of their faces, they were the faces that I saw at the Kebar River;
EZK.11.1	And the Spirit lifted me up, and it brought me to the eastern gate, the one facing east, of the temple
EZK.11.2	And he said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.11.3	who are saying, “The building of houses is not near; the city is the pot, and we are the flesh. 
EZK.11.4	Therefore prophesy against them! Prophesy, son of man!”
EZK.11.5	And the Spirit of Yahweh fell on me, and he said to me, “Say, ‘thus says Yahweh: “This is what you think, house of Israel, and I myself know them,
EZK.11.6	You made your slain ones numerous in this city, and you have filled its streets with slain ones.” ’
EZK.11.7	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Your slain ones whom you put in its midst, they are the flesh, and it is the pot, and I
EZK.11.8	The sword you have feared, and the sword I will bring against you!” declares
EZK.11.9	“And I will bring you out from its midst, and I will give you into the hand of strangers, and I will execute judgments against you. 
EZK.11.10	By the sword you will fall at the border of Israel; I will judge you, and you will know that I am Yahweh. 
EZK.11.11	It will not be as a pot to you, and so you would be
EZK.11.12	And you will know that I am Yahweh, whose
EZK.11.13	And it happened that as I was prophesying,
EZK.11.14	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.11.15	“Son of man,
EZK.11.16	Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Though I have removed them far away among the nations and though I have scattered them among the countries, yet I was a sanctuary to them for a little while in the countries to which they have gone.’ ”
EZK.11.17	Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “And I will assemble you from the peoples, and I will gather you from the countries to which you were scattered among them, and I will give the land of Israel to you. 
EZK.11.18	And when they come there, then they will remove all of its vile idols and all of its detestable things from it. 
EZK.11.19	And I will give to them one heart, and a new spirit I will give
EZK.11.20	so that they may walk in my statutes, and they will keep my regulations, and they will do them, and they will be to me a people, and I myself will be to them as God. 
EZK.11.21	But to
EZK.11.22	Then
EZK.11.23	And the glory of Yahweh went up from the midst of the city, and it stood still on the mountain that is to the east of the city. 
EZK.11.24	And the Spirit lifted me up, and it brought me to Chaldea, to the exiles,
EZK.11.25	And I spoke to the exiles
EZK.12.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.12.2	“Son of man,
EZK.12.3	And you, son of man,
EZK.12.4	And you must bring out your baggage like the baggage of an exile by day before their eyes, and you must go out in the evening before their eyes like those who go into exile.
EZK.12.5	Before their eyes dig through for yourself,
EZK.12.6	Before their eyes, on your
EZK.12.7	And I did just as
EZK.12.8	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.12.9	“Son of man,
EZK.12.10	Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “This oracle is about the prince in Jerusalem and the entire
EZK.12.11	Say, ‘I am your sign, and just as
EZK.12.12	And the prince who is in the midst of them, on his shoulder he will carry the baggage in the dusk, and
EZK.12.13	And I will spread out my net on him, and he will be captured in my hunting snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, and there he will die. 
EZK.12.14	And all who are around him, his help
EZK.12.15	And they will know that I am Yahweh when I scatter them
EZK.12.16	But
EZK.12.17	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.12.18	“Son of man,
EZK.12.19	And you must say to the people of the land, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the inhabitants of Jerusalem about the land of Israel: “They will eat their food with anxiety and their water they will drink with horror, because their land will be desolate from
EZK.12.20	And the inhabited cites will be desolate,

EZK.12.22	“Son of man,
EZK.12.23	Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “I will put an end to this proverb, and they will not quote it as a proverb again in Israel.” ’ But
EZK.12.24	For there will not be any longer any false vision
EZK.12.25	For I, Yahweh, I will speak what I will speak as a word, and it will be done. It will not prolong itself any longer, for in your days, house of rebellion, I will speak a word and I will fulfill it!” declares
EZK.12.26	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.12.27	“Son of man,
EZK.12.28	Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “None of my words will be prolonged any longer that I speak as a word, and it will be fulfilled!” ’ ” declares
EZK.13.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.13.2	“Son of man,
EZK.13.3	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Alas, for the foolish prophets who are going after their own spirit, and they did not see anything!
EZK.13.4	Your prophets have been like foxes
EZK.13.5	You did not go up into
EZK.13.6	They saw falseness and a lying divination,
EZK.13.7	Have you not seen a false vision
EZK.13.8	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because of your speaking falseness and because you envisioned a lie, therefore, look! I am against you!” declares
EZK.13.9	“And it will be my hand against the prophets who are seeing falseness and who are practicing lying divination. They will not be in the council of my people, and they will not be written down in the record book of the house of Israel, and into
EZK.13.10	Because, yes, because they led my people astray, saying
EZK.13.11	Say to those covering it with whitewash that it will fall; there will be a torrent of rain,
EZK.13.12	And look! When the wall falls, will it not be said to you, ‘Where is the whitewash with which you covered it?’ 
EZK.13.13	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘And so I will let burst forth a windstorm
EZK.13.14	And I will break down the wall that you covered with whitewash, and I will knock it to the ground, and its foundation will be revealed, and it will fall, and you will come to an end in the midst of it, and you will know that I am Yahweh! 
EZK.13.15	And I will fully vent my rage against the wall and against those covering it with whitewash, and I will say to you, “The wall is no more,
EZK.13.16	that is, the prophets of Israel, the ones prophesying concerning Jerusalem and the ones seeing visions of peace, and there is not peace!’ ” ” declares
EZK.13.17	“And you, son of man,
EZK.13.18	And you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Woe to those who sew
EZK.13.19	And you defiled me among my people for a handful of barley and for morsels of bread to kill persons who should not die and to keep alive persons who should not live by means of your lies to my people who are listening to your lies.” ’
EZK.13.20	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Look! I am against your magic charm bands with which you are ensnaring persons
EZK.13.21	And I will tear off your veils, and I will deliver my people from your hand, and they will not any longer be in your hand as prey, and you will know that I am Yahweh. 
EZK.13.22	Because you disheartened the heart of the righteous by deception, and I have not
EZK.13.23	Therefore falseness
EZK.14.1	And men from the elders of Israel came to me, and they sat before me.
EZK.14.2	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.14.3	“Son of man,
EZK.14.4	Therefore speak with them, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Every person from the house of Israel who brings up his idols into his heart and places before himself
EZK.14.5	so that I may take hold of the house of Israel by their heart, those who are estranged from me, all of them, through their idols.’ 
EZK.14.6	Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Return,
EZK.14.7	For each person
EZK.14.8	And I will set my face against that person, and I will make him to
EZK.14.9	And the prophet, if he is deceived and he speaks a word, I Yahweh, I have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him, and I will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. 
EZK.14.10	And they will bear their guilt, like
EZK.14.11	so that the house of Israel will not go astray again from me,

EZK.14.13	“Son of man,
EZK.14.14	And if even the three of these men were in the midst of it—Noah, Daniel, and Job—they, through their righteousness, would save only themselves!”
EZK.14.15	“If a fierce animal I should let cross through the land, and it should make it childless and it will be a desolation, so that there will not be one crossing over the land due to
EZK.14.16	even if these three men were in the midst of it, as surely as I live,”
EZK.14.17	Or, if I bring a sword over that land, and I say, ‘Sword, let it cross over into
EZK.14.18	And if these three men were in the midst of it, as surely as I live,”
EZK.14.19	And if I were to send a plague to that land, and I pour out my rage on it with blood to cut it off, both human and animal, 
EZK.14.20	and if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in the midst of her, as surely as I live,”
EZK.14.21	For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “How much more when I send my four punishments—the evil sword, and famine, and a fierce animal, and a plague—to Jerusalem to cut it off, both human and animal! 
EZK.14.22	But
EZK.14.23	And they will console you when you see their way and their deeds, and you will know that not for nothing I did all that I did in it,” declares
EZK.15.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.15.2	“Son of man, how will the wood of the vine be better than
EZK.15.3	Can wood be taken from it to make anything, or can they take a tent peg from it to hang on it any object?
EZK.15.4	Look! It is given to the fire as fuel. The fire will consume two of its ends, and its middle will be charred. Is it useful for anything? 
EZK.15.5	Look! When it is in perfect condition,
EZK.15.6	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Just like
EZK.15.7	And I will set my face against them. From the fire they mayescape,
EZK.15.8	And I will make the land a desolation because they acted very unfaithfully!”
EZK.16.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.16.2	“Son of man,
EZK.16.3	and you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth were from the land of the Canaanites,
EZK.16.4	And as for your birth, on the day you were born
EZK.16.5	No eye took pity on you
EZK.16.6	“ ‘And I passed by you, and I saw you kicking about in your blood, and I said to you in your blood, “Live! 
EZK.16.7	Grow up;
EZK.16.8	“ ‘And I passed by you, and I saw you, and look, your time of lovemaking had come,
EZK.16.9	And I washed you with water, and I rinsed off your blood from on you, and I anointed you with oil. 
EZK.16.10	And I clothed you with beautiful finished cloth, and I put sandals on you of fine leather, and I bound you in fine linen, and I covered you with costly fabric. 
EZK.16.11	And I adorned you with ornaments,
EZK.16.12	And I put an ornamental ring on your nose and earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown
EZK.16.13	And you adorned yourself with gold and silver, and your clothing was fine linen and costly fabric and beautiful finished cloth; you ate finely milled flour and honey and olive oil, and you became exceedingly beautiful; you were fit to be a queen.
EZK.16.14	And a name went out for you among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect because of my majesty that I bestowed on you,’ declares
EZK.16.15	‘And you trusted in your beauty, and you prostituted on account of your name, and you poured out your fornication on every one passing by, saying, “Let it be his.” 
EZK.16.16	And you took from your clothes and you made for yourself colorful
EZK.16.17	And you took your beautiful jewelry
EZK.16.18	And you took the clothes of your beautiful finished cloth, and you covered them and my oil and my incense you set before them.
EZK.16.19	And my bread that I gave to you, finely milled flour and oil and honey with which I fed you, then you set it before them
EZK.16.20	‘And you took your sons and your daughters whom you had borne for me, and you sacrificed them to them to be eaten,
EZK.16.21	And you slaughtered my children, and you gave them to be sacrificed to them.
EZK.16.22	And in all of your detestable things and your fornication you did not remember the days of your childhood when you were naked and bare,
EZK.16.23	“ ‘And then after all of your evil! Woe, woe, to you!’ declares
EZK.16.24	‘And then you built for yourself a mound, and you made for yourself a high place in every public square. 
EZK.16.25	At the head of every street you built your high place and you disgraced your beauty and you spread your feet for every passerby, and you increased your whoring. 
EZK.16.26	And you prostituted with the Egyptians,
EZK.16.27	And look! I stretched out my hand against you, and I reduced your portion, and I gave you into
EZK.16.28	And you prostituted with the Assyrians
EZK.16.29	And you increased your fornication to the land of traders,
EZK.16.30	How hot with fever was your heart!’ declares
EZK.16.31	when you built
EZK.16.32	O, adulterous woman! In the place of her husband she received strangers. 
EZK.16.33	To all prostitutes they give a fee, but you, you gave your gifts to all of your lovers, and you bribed them to come to you from all around in your whorings! 
EZK.16.34	And it was the opposite with you from the other women in your whorings; no one solicited you as a prostitute.
EZK.16.35	“ ‘Therefore, prostitute, hear the word of Yahweh. 
EZK.16.36	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because of the pouring out of your shame and because your nakedness was revealed in your whoring with your lovers, and on account of all of the idols of your detestable things, and according to the blood of your children whom you gave to them, 
EZK.16.37	therefore, look! I am gathering all of your lovers whom you were pleased about,
EZK.16.38	And I will judge you with the judgment of women committing adultery and shedding blood, and I will give you the blood of rage and jealousy. 
EZK.16.39	And I will give you into their hand, and they will demolish your mound, and they will break down your high places, and they will strip you of your clothes, and they will take your beautiful jewelry,
EZK.16.40	And they will bring up against you a crowd, and they will stone you with stones,
EZK.16.41	And they will burn your houses with fire, and they will execute against you judgments before
EZK.16.42	And I will satisfy my rage on you, and my jealousy will turn away from you, and I will be calm, and I will not be angry any longer. 
EZK.16.43	Because
EZK.16.44	Look! Everyone quoting a proverb
EZK.16.45	You are a daughter of your mother who abhorred her husband and her children, and you are a sister of your sisters who abhorred their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father was an Amorite. 
EZK.16.46	And your elder sister, she is Samaria, and her daughters, who are dwelling on your north, and your younger sister is the one dwelling on your south; she is Sodom and her daughters. 
EZK.16.47	And you have not only gone in their ways, but
EZK.16.48	As surely as I live,’
EZK.16.49	Look! This was the iniquity of Sodom, your sister: Pride, abundance of food, and prosperous ease
EZK.16.50	And they were proud, and they did a detestable thing before me,
EZK.16.51	And Samaria did not sin according to even half of your sins,
EZK.16.52	Also,
EZK.16.53	And I will restore their fortune, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and even the fortunes of your captivity in the midst of them, 
EZK.16.54	in order that you may bear your disgrace and you may be put to shame because of all that you did at your consoling them. 
EZK.16.55	And as for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, they will return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters, they will return to their former state, and you and your daughters will return to your former state. 
EZK.16.56	And was not Sodom, your sister, a byword in your mouth in the day of your pride 
EZK.16.57	before
EZK.16.58	Your wickedness and your detestable things, you, you must bear them,’ declares
EZK.16.59	‘For thus says the Lord Yahweh: And I will do it
EZK.16.60	And I, I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish with you an everlasting covenant.
EZK.16.61	And you will remember your ways, and you will be ashamed when you take your sisters, both the older and the younger,
EZK.16.62	And I, I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am Yahweh, 
EZK.16.63	in order that you will remember, and you will be ashamed, and you will not open your mouth again
EZK.17.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.17.2	“Son of man,
EZK.17.3	and you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “The great eagle with great wings and long feathers
EZK.17.4	He plucked the top of its new plant shoot, and he brought it to the land of Canaan and put it in a city of merchants, 
EZK.17.5	and he took from the seed of the land and placed it in fertile soil
EZK.17.6	And it sprouted, and it became a vine spreading out,
EZK.17.7	“ ‘ “And there was another great eagle, great of wings and with abundant plumage, and look! This vine stretched out its roots toward him and extended its branches to him to water it from the garden bed where it was planted.
EZK.17.8	It was planted in
EZK.17.9	Say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Will it prosper? Will he not tear out its roots, and will he not make its fruit scaly, and it will wither, and all of the freshness of its vegetation will dry up? And to lift it from its roots will not require great strength or many people.
EZK.17.10	And look! Though it is planted, will it prosper? When the east wind strikes it,
EZK.17.11	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.17.12	“Say now to the rebellious house of Israel, ‘Do you not know what these are?’
EZK.17.13	And he took from the seed of the kingship, and he made with him a covenant, and he brought him under oath,
EZK.17.14	so that they would be a humble kingdom and not lift itself up to keep his covenant in order for it to stand.
EZK.17.15	But he rebelled against him by sending his messengers to Egypt to give to him horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Will he escape doing these things, and can he break the covenant and escape? 
EZK.17.16	As I live,’
EZK.17.17	And not with a great army and with a great crowd will Pharaoh work
EZK.17.18	And he despised the oath to break covenant. And, look, he gave his hand in pledge, and yet he did all of these things. He will not escape.’ 
EZK.17.19	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘As I live,
EZK.17.20	And I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my hunting net, and I will bring him to Babylon, and I will enter into judgment with him there about his infidelity that he displayed against me. 
EZK.17.21	And all of his choice troops, among all of his troops, they will fall by the sword, and those who are remaining,
EZK.17.22	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘And I will take, even I, from the treetop of the high cedar, and I will plant it, from the head of its new plant shoot I will pluck a tender one, and I will plant it, even I, on a high and lofty mountain. 
EZK.17.23	On the height of the mountain of Israel I will plant it, and it will carry
EZK.17.24	And all of the trees of the field will know that I, Yahweh, I will bring low a high tree, and I will exalt a low, fresh tree, and I will make a dry tree flourish. I, Yahweh, I have spoken, and I will do it.’ ” 
EZK.18.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.18.2	“What do you mean by
EZK.18.3	As I live,
EZK.18.4	Look! All lives are mine.
EZK.18.5	And if a man is righteous and does justice and righteousness, 
EZK.18.6	and on the mountains he does not eat and he does not lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and the wife of his neighbor he does not defile and he does not approach a woman of
EZK.18.7	and he oppresses no one
EZK.18.8	and he does not charge interest
EZK.18.9	and in my statutes he goes about and my regulations he keeps,
EZK.18.10	“And now he has a son, a violent one, who sheds blood
EZK.18.11	(though
EZK.18.12	He oppresses the needy and the poor, and he commits robbery,
EZK.18.13	He charges interest
EZK.18.14	“And look! He has a son, and he sees all of the sin of his father that he did, and he sees it, but he does not do it. 
EZK.18.15	On the mountains he does not eat, and he does not lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and the wife of his neighbor he does not defile. 
EZK.18.16	And he oppresses no one; he requires no pledge for a loan, and he does not commit robbery;
EZK.18.17	He brings back
EZK.18.18	Because his father oppressed severely;
EZK.18.19	“Yet
EZK.18.20	The person,
EZK.18.21	But if the wicked returns from all of his sins
EZK.18.22	All of his transgressions that he committed will not be remembered against
EZK.18.23	Have I delight by any means
EZK.18.24	And when the righteous turns
EZK.18.25	“Yet
EZK.18.26	When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and he does injustice, then
EZK.18.27	And when the wicked turns from his wickedness that he did and he does justice and righteousness, he will preserve his life.
EZK.18.28	And if he sees and he returns from all of his transgressions that he did, surely he will live; he will not die! 
EZK.18.29	And yet they, the house of Israel, say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair!’ Are not my ways fair, house of Israel? Are not your ways unfair?
EZK.18.30	“Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, each one
EZK.18.31	Throw away from yourselves
EZK.18.32	For I have no pleasure in the death of the dying,” declares
EZK.19.1	“And you, raise a lament about
EZK.19.2	and you must say, 
EZK.19.2	‘What a lioness was your mother 
EZK.19.2	among the lions. 
EZK.19.2	She lay down in the midst of young lions, 
EZK.19.2	and she reared her lion cubs. 
EZK.19.3	And she raised up one from her cubs; 
EZK.19.3	he became a fierce lion, 
EZK.19.3	and he learned to tear prey; 
EZK.19.3	he ate
EZK.19.4	And nations heard about him; 
EZK.19.4	in their pit he was caught, 
EZK.19.4	and they brought him with hooks 
EZK.19.4	to the land of Egypt. 
EZK.19.5	And she saw
EZK.19.5	her hope was destroyed, 
EZK.19.5	and she took one from her cubs, 
EZK.19.5	and she made him a fierce lion. 
EZK.19.6	And he walked about in the midst of lions; 
EZK.19.6	he became a fierce lion, 
EZK.19.6	and he learned to tear prey; 
EZK.19.6	he ate
EZK.19.7	And he knew their widows,
EZK.19.7	and he devastated their cities, 
EZK.19.7	and the land was appalled, and everyone in it
EZK.19.7	at the sound of his roar. 
EZK.19.8	And nations set out against him 
EZK.19.8	from the surrounding provinces,
EZK.19.8	and they spread their net over him, 
EZK.19.8	and he was caught in their pit. 
EZK.19.9	And they put him in a collar with hooks, 
EZK.19.9	and they brought him to the king of Babylon; 
EZK.19.9	they brought him into
EZK.19.9	so that his voice would not be heard any longer
EZK.19.9	on the mountains of Israel. 
EZK.19.10	Your mother was like the vine in your vineyard;
EZK.19.10	planted fruitfully
EZK.19.10	and it was full of branches 
EZK.19.10	from many waters.
EZK.19.11	And she produced branches of strength
EZK.19.11	to
EZK.19.11	its height became tall 
EZK.19.11	between
EZK.19.11	and it was seen
EZK.19.11	among the abundance of its branches. 
EZK.19.12	But it was uprooted in rage; 
EZK.19.12	it was thrown to the earth, 
EZK.19.12	and the east wind dried up its fruit; 
EZK.19.12	they were stripped off, 
EZK.19.12	and its strong branch dried up; 
EZK.19.12	fire consumed it. 
EZK.19.13	And now it is planted in the desert, 
EZK.19.13	in a dry and thirsty land.
EZK.19.14	And so fire has gone out from the stem of its branches; 
EZK.19.14	its fruit it has consumed, 
EZK.19.14	and there was not in it a strong branch,
EZK.19.14	a scepter for ruling.’ ” 
EZK.19.14	This is a lament, and it will be used as a lament.
EZK.20.1	And then in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, men from the elders of Israel came to consult Yahweh, and they sat before me.
EZK.20.2	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.20.3	“Son of man,
EZK.20.4	Will you judge them? Will you judge them, son of man?
EZK.20.5	And you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “On the day of my choosing Israel I swore
EZK.20.6	On that day I swore
EZK.20.7	Then I said to them, ‘Let each one throw away the detestable things of his eyes, and you must not make yourselves unclean with the idols of Egypt! I am Yahweh your God.’ 
EZK.20.8	But they rebelled against me, and they were not willing to listen to me; each one did not throw away
EZK.20.9	“But
EZK.20.10	And I brought them out from the land of Egypt, and I brought them to the desert, 
EZK.20.11	and I gave my statutes to them, and my regulations I made known to them, which, if a person does them, then he will live by them. 
EZK.20.12	And also my Sabbaths I gave to them to be a sign between me and between them so they would know
EZK.20.13	“But
EZK.20.14	and I acted for the sake of my name, that it not be profaned before the eyes of the nations before whom I brought them out.
EZK.20.15	And also I myself swore
EZK.20.16	because they despised my judgments, and they did not walk in my statutes,
EZK.20.17	But my eye took pity on them by not destroying them, and I did not completely destroy them
EZK.20.18	“And I said to their children in the desert, ‘You must not go in the statutes of your parents;
EZK.20.19	I, Yahweh, am your God, so go in my statutes and keep my regulations and do them. 
EZK.20.20	And treat my Sabbaths as holy, and they will be a sign between me and between you that you may know
EZK.20.21	But the children rebelled against me; they did not walk in my statutes,
EZK.20.22	But I withheld my hand, and I acted for the sake of my name not to be profaned before the eyes of the nations before whom I had brought them out before their eyes. 
EZK.20.23	What is more, I swore
EZK.20.24	because they did not do my regulations, and my statutes they despised, and my Sabbaths they profaned, and their eyes were after the idols of their ancestors.
EZK.20.25	And in turn I gave to them rules that were not good and regulations by which they will not live.
EZK.20.26	And I defiled them through their gifts in sacrificing all of the first offspring of the womb, in order that
EZK.20.27	“Therefore speak to the house of Israel, son of man,
EZK.20.28	And I brought them to the land that I swore
EZK.20.29	And I said to them, ‘What is the high place
EZK.20.30	Therefore thus say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “In the way of your ancestors
EZK.20.31	And when you lift up your gifts, sacrificing your children
EZK.20.32	And what you are planning,
EZK.20.33	“As I live,”
EZK.20.34	And I will bring you from the peoples, and I will gather you from the countries to which you were scattered with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with rage poured out. 
EZK.20.35	Then I will bring you to the desert of the peoples, and I will execute justice on you there face to face. 
EZK.20.36	Just as
EZK.20.37	“And I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant. 
EZK.20.38	And I will purge the rebels from among you and the ones transgressing against me; I will bring them out from the land where they are living as aliens,
EZK.20.39	And you, house of Israel, thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Let each one go serve his idols now and after, if you are not listening to me, but my holy name
EZK.20.40	“For on my holy mountain,
EZK.20.41	I will accept you as a fragrant incense offering
EZK.20.42	And you will know that I am Yahweh when I bring you to the land of Israel, to the land that I swore
EZK.20.43	And you will remember there your ways, and all of your deeds by which you were made unclean,
EZK.20.44	And you will know that I am Yahweh when I deal with you
EZK.20.45	 And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.20.46	“Son of man,
EZK.20.47	And you must say to the forest of the Negev, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am kindling against you a fire, and it will devour in you every fresh tree and every dry tree; the blaze of the flame will not be quenched, and all the surfaces from the south to the north will be scorched by it. 
EZK.20.48	And all creatures will see that I, Yahweh, I kindled it—it will not be quenched!” ’ ” 
EZK.20.49	Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh, they are saying about me, ‘Is he not posing a parable?’ ” 
EZK.21.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.21.2	“Son of man,
EZK.21.3	And you must say to the land of Israel, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “Look! I am against you, and I will draw out my sword from its sheath, and I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked. 
EZK.21.4	Because
EZK.21.5	And they will know, all creatures, that I, Yahweh, I will bring out my sword from its sheath; it will not return again!” ’ 
EZK.21.6	And you, son of man,
EZK.21.7	And then
EZK.21.8	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.21.9	“Son of man,
EZK.21.10	It is sharpened to slaughter a slaughter, polished to flash like lightning!
EZK.21.11	And he gives it to be polished, to be seized by the hand.
EZK.21.12	Cry and wail, son of man,
EZK.21.13	For examine!
EZK.21.14	And you, son of man,
EZK.21.15	so that a heart melts, and the fallen multiply
EZK.21.16	Gather together, strike to the right; cause to go to the left, where your edge
EZK.21.17	And also I myself
EZK.21.18	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.21.19	“And you, son of man,
EZK.21.20	You must mark a road for the coming of the sword to Rabbah of the Ammonites
EZK.21.21	For the king of Babylon stands at the fork of the road at the head of the two roads to practice divination. He shakes the arrows,
EZK.21.22	In his right hand is the divination for Jerusalem, to put up battering rams, to open a mouth for slaughter,
EZK.21.23	And it will be to them like practicing divination falsely
EZK.21.24	“Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because you have brought to remembrance your guilt by the uncovering of your transgressions, so that your sins in all of your deeds appear—because of your being remembered, you will be captured in the hand.’ 
EZK.21.25	And as for you, profane one, wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come with the time of the punishment of the end, 
EZK.21.26	thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Remove the turban and lift off the crown; things are no longer the same. Exalt the low and bring low the high. 
EZK.21.27	A ruin, a ruin, a ruin I will make it! Also
EZK.21.28	And you, son of man,
EZK.21.29	when seeing a false vision for you in vain, when practicing divination for you falsely, to give
EZK.21.30	Return it to its sheath in the place where you were created. In the land of your origin I will judge you! 
EZK.21.31	And I will pour out my anger on you; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and I will give you into the hand of brutal men, skilled craftsmen of destruction. 
EZK.21.32	You will be as fuel for the fire; your blood will be in the midst of the earth. You will not be remembered, for I, Yahweh, I have spoken.’ ” 
EZK.22.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.22.2	“And you, son of man,
EZK.22.3	And you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “A city pouring out blood in the midst of her; its time has come,
EZK.22.4	By your blood that you poured out you have become guilty, and by your idols that you made you have become unclean, and you have brought your days near, and your appointed years have come.
EZK.22.5	The people near and the people far from you will make fun of you, the unclean and the terrified.
EZK.22.6	Look! The princes of Israel, each one according to his strength,
EZK.22.7	They have treated father and mother with contempt in you; they violated
EZK.22.8	You despised my holy objects; my Sabbaths you profaned. 
EZK.22.9	Slanderous men are among you
EZK.22.10	They uncover the nakedness of a father among
EZK.22.11	And a man does a detestable thing with the wife of his neighbor, and a man defiles his daughter-in-law in wickedness, and a man sexually violates among
EZK.22.12	They take a bribe among
EZK.22.13	And look! I strike my hand for your ill-gotten gain that you have made and at your blood that was in the midst of you. 
EZK.22.14	Can your heart endure,
EZK.22.15	I will scatter you among the nations, and I will disperse you through the countries, and I will purge your uncleanness from you. 
EZK.22.16	And I will be profaned by you before the eyes of the nations, and you will know that I am Yahweh.” ’ ” 
EZK.22.17	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.22.18	“Son of man,
EZK.22.19	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because all of you have become as silver dross, therefore look! I am gathering you to the midst of Jerusalem, 
EZK.22.20	like the gathering of silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin to the middle of a furnace to blow fire on it for melting. Thus I will gather in my anger and in my rage, and I will deposit
EZK.22.21	And I will gather you, and I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and so I will melt you in the midst of her. 
EZK.22.22	Thus you will be melted like the melting of silver in the midst of a furnace, and you will know that I, Yahweh, I have poured out my rage on you.’ ” 
EZK.22.23	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.22.24	“Son of man,
EZK.22.25	The conspiracy of its prophets in the midst of her is like a roaring lion that is tearing prey. They devour people, and they take wealth and treasure; they make its widows numerous in the midst of her. 
EZK.22.26	Its priests treat my law violently, and they profane my holy objects; they do not distinguish between a holy object and what is unholy, or between the clean and the unclean. They do not teach the difference, and they hide their eyes from my Sabbaths, and so I am profaned in the midst of them. 
EZK.22.27	Its officials are like wolves tearing prey in its midst, to pour out blood, to destroy people, to make dishonest gain. 
EZK.22.28	And for them its prophets plaster whitewash; they are seeing falseness and are practicing divination for them by lying, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh,’ and Yahweh has not spoken. 
EZK.22.29	They severely oppress the people of the land, and they committed robbery,
EZK.22.30	And so I sought for them somebody, one repairing the wall and standing in the breach before me
EZK.22.31	and so I poured out my indignation on them. With the fire of my wrath I destroyed them; I returned their way upon their head,” declares
EZK.23.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.23.2	“Son of man,
EZK.23.3	and they prostituted themselves in Egypt in their childhood; they were prostituting themselves there, and their breasts were fondled, and there they caressed the bosoms of their virginity. 
EZK.23.4	Now as for their names, the older was Oholah, and Oholibah was her sister. And they became mine,
EZK.23.5	And Oholah prostituted herself while she was still mine,
EZK.23.6	clothed in blue cloth, governors and prefects, handsome young men
EZK.23.7	And she bestowed her fornication on them, on the choice ones of the Assyrians,
EZK.23.8	And her whorings from the time of Egypt she did not abandon, for they slept with her in her childhood, and they caressed the bosoms of her virginity, and they poured out their fornication on her. 
EZK.23.9	Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians
EZK.23.10	They uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, and they killed her with the sword. And she became a name for the women, and they executed judgments against her. 
EZK.23.11	“And though Oholibah her sister saw, yet in her lust she behaved more corruptly than her,
EZK.23.12	She lusted after the Assyrians,
EZK.23.13	And I saw that she was defiled; they had both taken the same path!
EZK.23.14	And she increased her whorings, and she saw men carved
EZK.23.15	belted with a belt at
EZK.23.16	And she lusted for them when her eyes saw them,
EZK.23.17	And so the Babylonians
EZK.23.18	And she revealed her whorings, and she revealed her nakedness, and so I turned from her just as
EZK.23.19	Yet
EZK.23.20	And she lusted after her male lovers whose genitalia were the genitalia of male donkeys and their seminal emission was the seminal emission of horses. 
EZK.23.21	And you longed after the obscene conduct of your youth when your bosom was caressed by Egypt, fondling your young breasts. 
EZK.23.22	“Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Look! I am stirring up your lovers against you concerning whom you turned away, and I will bring them against you from all around: 
EZK.23.23	the Babylonians
EZK.23.24	And they will come against you with an army chariot and wagon and with a crowd
EZK.23.25	And I will direct my zeal against you, and they will deal with you in anger; your nose and your ears they will remove, and those who are left,
EZK.23.26	And they will strip you of your clothes, and they will take your splendid jewelry.
EZK.23.27	And I will put an end to your obscene conduct coming from you and your fornication from the land of Egypt, and you will not lift your eyes to them; and you will not remember Egypt again.’ 
EZK.23.28	For thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Look! I am giving you into the hand of those you hated, into the hand of those from whom
EZK.23.29	And they will deal with you in hatred, and they will take all of your acquisitions, and they will leave you naked and in bareness; and the nakedness of your fornication and your obscene conduct and your whorings will be exposed. 
EZK.23.30	These things are accomplished
EZK.23.31	You went in the same way of your sister, and I will give her cup into your hand.” ’ 
EZK.23.32	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “You will drink the deep and wide
EZK.23.33	You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, for a cup of horror and desolation is the cup of your sister, Samaria. 
EZK.23.34	And you will drink it, and you will drain it, and its potsherds you will gnaw, and you will tear out your breasts, for I myself
EZK.23.35	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because you have forgotten me, and you threw me behind your back, now in turn
EZK.23.36	And Yahweh said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.23.37	For they committed adultery, and blood is on their hands, and they committed adultery with their idols, and even their children that they had borne for me—they sacrificed them as food! 
EZK.23.38	Also they did this to me: they defiled my sanctuary on that day, and they profaned my Sabbaths, 
EZK.23.39	and when they slaughtered their children for their idols, they came to my sanctuary on that day to profane it. And look, this is what they did in my house!
EZK.23.40	What is worse,
EZK.23.41	And you sat on a magnificent couch and a table prepared before her,
EZK.23.42	And a sound of a carefree crowd was with it,
EZK.23.43	And I said to
EZK.23.44	And so they went to her like going to a female
EZK.23.45	But righteous men, they will judge them with the judgment of committing adultery, and with the judgment of shedding blood; for they were committing adultery, and blood was on their hands.” 
EZK.23.46	For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Bring up against them an assembly, and make them as a thing of horror and as plunder. 
EZK.23.47	And an assembly must stone them with stones,
EZK.23.48	And I will cause obscene conduct to cease from the land,
EZK.23.49	And they will repay your obscene conduct upon you, and the guilt of your idols you will bear, and you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh. 
EZK.24.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.24.2	“Son of man,
EZK.24.3	And deliver a proverb
EZK.24.4	Gather its pieces to it, every good piece, thigh and shoulder, fill it with choice bones; 
EZK.24.5	take the choicest of the flock, and also pile the bones
EZK.24.6	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Woe to the city of bloodguilt! A pot that has its rust in it; its rust did not go out from it.
EZK.24.7	For her blood was in the midst of her; she put it on a bare rock;
EZK.24.8	To stir up rage, to avenge myself through vengeance, I placed its blood on the barrenness of a rock, so that it may not be covered.”
EZK.24.9	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Woe to the city of bloodguilt! I, even I, will make the pile of wood great! 
EZK.24.10	Pile up the logs; kindle the fire; finish cooking the meat, and mix in the spices, and let the bones be burned.
EZK.24.11	And make it stand
EZK.24.12	Through effort she has caused weariness; its thick rust
EZK.24.13	In your uncleanness is obscene conduct, because I cleansed you, but you were not clean from your uncleanness; you will not be clean again until I fully vent my rage
EZK.24.14	I, Yahweh, I have spoken. It is coming, and I did it; I will not disregard, and I will not take pity, and I will not reconsider. According to your ways and according to your deeds they will judge you!”
EZK.24.15	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.24.16	“Son of man,
EZK.24.17	Sigh in silence for the dead; you shall not make a mourning ceremony. Bind your turban on you, and you must put your sandals on your feet. You must not cover your upper lip,
EZK.24.18	And I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening, and I did in the morning just as
EZK.24.19	And the people said to me, “Will you not make known to us what these things that you are doing mean for us?” 
EZK.24.20	And I said to them that the word of Yahweh came
EZK.24.21	“Say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I will be profaning my sanctuary, the pride of your strength and the delight of your eyes and the object of your own
EZK.24.22	and you shall do just as
EZK.24.23	And your turban must be on your heads, and your sandals must be on your feet. You shall not mourn, and you shall not weep, but you shall waste away because of your iniquities, and you shall groan to one another.
EZK.24.24	And Ezekiel will be to you as a sign; everything that he did
EZK.24.25	“And you, son of man,
EZK.24.26	on that day a survivor will come to you with the news.
EZK.24.27	On that day your mouth shall be opened at the arrival of the fugitive,
EZK.25.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.25.2	“Son of man,
EZK.25.3	and you must say to the Ammonites,
EZK.25.4	therefore look! I am giving you to the people
EZK.25.5	And I will make Rabbah as a pasture of camels and the Ammonites
EZK.25.6	For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because of clapping your hand and stamping with your foot, and because you rejoiced in
EZK.25.7	therefore look! I stretched out my hand against you, and I will give you as plunder
EZK.25.8	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because of Moab and Seir saying, ‘The house of Judah is like all of the nations,’ 
EZK.25.9	therefore, look! I am opening the side of
EZK.25.10	I will give it to the people
EZK.25.11	And on Moab I will execute punishments, and they will know that I am Yahweh.” 
EZK.25.12	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because of the doings of Edom in avenging himself with vengeance for
EZK.25.13	therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “so
EZK.25.14	And I will exact my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they will do in Edom according to my anger and according to my rage, and they will know my vengeance,” declares
EZK.25.15	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because of the acting
EZK.25.16	therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Look! I am stretching out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Kerethites, and I will destroy the remainder of the seacoast.
EZK.25.17	And I will execute on them great vengeance with punishments of rage, and they will know that I am Yahweh when I exact my vengeance on them!” 
EZK.26.1	And it was in the eleventh
EZK.26.2	“Son of man,
EZK.26.3	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Look! I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring up against you many nations like the stirring up of the sea stirring up its waves.
EZK.26.4	And I will destroy the walls of Tyre, and they will demolish its towers, and I will scrape away its earthen dirt from it, and I will make it into a bare rock.
EZK.26.5	It will become a place for spreading out dragnets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken,’ declares
EZK.26.6	and its daughters who are in the field with the sword, they will be killed; and they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” 
EZK.26.7	For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am bringing to Tyre Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, from the north, the king of kings, with horse and with chariot and with horsemen and his assembly and many people. 
EZK.26.8	Your daughters he will kill in the field with the sword, and he will place
EZK.26.9	and the thrust of his battering ram he will direct against your walls, and your towers he will break down with his weapons. 
EZK.26.10	From the abundance of his horses he will cover you with their fine dust; at the sound of horseman and wheel and chariot your walls will shake, at his coming into your gates like the entrance of a city that is being broken through. 
EZK.26.11	With the hooves of his horses he will trample all of your streets. He will kill your people with the sword, and your strong stone pillars
EZK.26.12	And they will plunder your wealth, and they will loot your merchandise, and they will break down your walls, and the houses of your delight they will break down, and your stones and your timbers and your earthen dirt they will cast into the midst of the water. 
EZK.26.13	And, I will put an end to the noise of your songs, and the sound of your lyres will not be heard any longer. 
EZK.26.14	And I will make you into a bare rock,
EZK.26.15	Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Tyre, “Will not the coastlands shake from the sound of your downfall, at the groaning of the wounded, at people being killed
EZK.26.16	And all the princes of the sea will go down from their thrones, and they will remove their robes, and their beautiful garments
EZK.26.17	And they will raise a lament over you, and they will say to you, 
EZK.26.17	‘How you have been lost who was inhabited from
EZK.26.17	the city that was praised, that was strong. 
EZK.26.17	It is located on the sea, 
EZK.26.17	and its inhabitants imposed their terror on all of its inhabitants.
EZK.26.18	Now the coastlands will tremble 
EZK.26.18	at the day of your downfall, 
EZK.26.18	and the islands that are in the sea 
EZK.26.18	will be horrified because of your departure.’ ” 
EZK.26.19	For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “When I make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited, when bringing up over you the deep, the great surging waters
EZK.26.20	And I will bring you down with those who are going down to the grave,
EZK.26.21	Sudden terrors I will bring on you, and you shall no longer exist; and you will be sought, and you will not be found again forever,”
EZK.27.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.27.2	“And you, son of man,
EZK.27.3	And you must say to Tyre, the one who sits at the entrance of the sea as the merchant of the peoples to the many coastlands, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
EZK.27.3	Tyre, you yourself said
EZK.27.3	“I am perfect in beauty!”
EZK.27.4	In the heart of the seas are your boundaries; 
EZK.27.4	your builders perfected your beauty. 
EZK.27.5	They built with pine trees from Senir 
EZK.27.5	all of your boards for you; 
EZK.27.5	they took cedars from Lebanon 
EZK.27.5	to make a sailing mast for you.
EZK.27.6	They made your oars 
EZK.27.6	with oaks from Bashan; 
EZK.27.6	your deck they made with inlaid ivory, 
EZK.27.6	with cypress trees from the coastlands of Cyprus.
EZK.27.7	Your sail was fine linen with colorful weaving from Egypt 
EZK.27.7	to serve as a banner for you;
EZK.27.7	blue and purple cloth from the coastlands of Cyprus
EZK.27.7	was your awning. 
EZK.27.8	The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvan 
EZK.27.8	were your rowers; 
EZK.27.8	your skilled men,
EZK.27.8	and they were your seamen. 
EZK.27.9	The elders of Gebal and its skilled men
EZK.27.9	as the repairers of the seam of your boat; 
EZK.27.9	all of the ships of the sea and their mariners were among you
EZK.27.9	to barter your wares. 
EZK.27.10	Persia and Lud and Put 
EZK.27.10	were among your soldiers;
EZK.27.10	small shield and helmet hung among you
EZK.27.10	and gave to you your adornment. 
EZK.27.11	The people
EZK.27.11	were on your walls all around, 
EZK.27.11	and Gammadites 
EZK.27.11	were in your towers. 
EZK.27.11	They hung their quivers
EZK.27.11	they perfected your beauty. 
EZK.27.12	“ ‘Tarshish was your trader; from the abundance of all of their wealth, with silver, iron, tin, and lead they exchanged for your merchandise. 
EZK.27.13	Javan, Tubal, and Meshech were your traders; in exchange for people
EZK.27.14	From Beth Togarmah they exchanged horses and war horses and mules for your wares. 
EZK.27.15	The people
EZK.27.16	Edom
EZK.27.17	Judah and the land of Israel were trading with you with wheat from Minnith and millet and honey and olive oil and balm; all these they gave for your wares. 
EZK.27.18	Damascus was trading with you because of
EZK.27.19	Vedan and Javan from Uzal, they exchanged wrought iron, cinnamon,
EZK.27.20	Dedan was trading with you, with garments of woven material for riding. 
EZK.27.21	Arabia and all of the leaders of Kedar were your customers;
EZK.27.22	The traders of Sheba and Raamah were trading with you, with the finest of every spice and with every precious stone and gold; they exchanged all these for your merchandise. 
EZK.27.23	Haran and Canneh and Eden, the traders of Sheba, Assyria, and Kilmad were trading with you. 
EZK.27.24	They were trading with you in finery, in mantles of blue cloth and colorful embroidered work and with rugs of variegated cloth in twisted cords and knotted tightly; these were among your merchandise.
EZK.27.25	The ships of Tarshish were carrying for you your wares, and you were filled, and you became very heavy in the heart of the seas.

EZK.27.26	the rowers brought you;

EZK.27.27	they will fall in the heart of the seas on the day of your downfall. 
EZK.27.28	At the sound of the shout
EZK.27.28	the pasturelands will shake.

EZK.27.32	like this destruction in the midst of the sea?’ 
EZK.27.33	When your merchandise went out from the seas, 
EZK.27.33	you satisfied many peoples with the abundance of your wealth, 
EZK.27.33	and by your wares 
EZK.27.33	you made rich the kings of the world. 
EZK.27.34	Now you are broken by seas 
EZK.27.34	in the depths of waters; 
EZK.27.34	your wares and all of your crew 
EZK.27.34	in the midst of you have sunk. 
EZK.27.35	All of the inhabitants of the coastlands 
EZK.27.35	are appalled over you, 
EZK.27.35	and their kings shudder
EZK.27.35	they distort their faces!

EZK.28.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.28.2	“Son of man,
EZK.28.2	“Because your heart was haughty,

EZK.28.2	I sit in the seat of the gods, 
EZK.28.2	I sit in the heart of the seas!’ 
EZK.28.2	But
EZK.28.2	and you gave your heart to be like the heart of a god. 
EZK.28.3	Look, are you wiser than Daniel, 
EZK.28.3	so that no secret
EZK.28.4	By your wisdom and by your understanding 
EZK.28.4	you have gained for yourself wealth, 
EZK.28.4	and you have amassed gold and silver 
EZK.28.4	in your treasuries. 
EZK.28.5	By the abundance of your wisdom in your trading 
EZK.28.5	you have increased your wealth 
EZK.28.5	and your heart was proud in

EZK.28.6	“Because of your regarding your mind
EZK.28.6	like the mind

EZK.28.7	the most ruthless of the peoples, 
EZK.28.7	and they will draw their swords against the beauty
EZK.28.7	and they will defile your splendor. 
EZK.28.8	They will thrust you down to the pit, 
EZK.28.8	and you will die a violent death
EZK.28.8	in the heart of the seas. 
EZK.28.9	Will you indeed still say
EZK.28.9	before the face of your killers?
EZK.28.9	And in fact you are a human
EZK.28.9	in the hand of those who pierce you.
EZK.28.10	You will die the death of the uncircumcised 
EZK.28.10	by the hand of strangers, 
EZK.28.10	for I myself

EZK.28.12	“Son of man,
EZK.28.12	“You were a perfect model of
EZK.28.12	full of wisdom and perfect of beauty. 
EZK.28.13	You were in Eden, the garden of God, 
EZK.28.13	and every precious stone was your adornment: 
EZK.28.13	carnelian, topaz and moonstone,
EZK.28.13	turquoise, onyx and jasper, 
EZK.28.13	sapphire,
EZK.28.13	And gold was the craftsmanship of your settings 
EZK.28.13	and your mountings in you; 
EZK.28.13	on the day when you were created they were prepared. 
EZK.28.14	You were an anointed guardian cherub, 
EZK.28.14	and I placed you on God’s holy mountain;
EZK.28.14	you walked in the midst of stones of fire. 
EZK.28.15	You were blameless in your ways 
EZK.28.15	from the day when you were created,
EZK.28.15	until wickedness was found in you. 
EZK.28.16	In the abundance of your trading, 
EZK.28.16	they filled the midst of you with violence, and you sinned; 
EZK.28.16	and I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God, 
EZK.28.16	and I expelled you, the guardian
EZK.28.16	from the midst of the stones of fire. 
EZK.28.17	Your heart was proud because of your beauty; 
EZK.28.17	you ruined your wisdom because of your splendor. 
EZK.28.17	I threw you on the ground before

EZK.28.18	From the abundance of your iniquities 
EZK.28.18	in the dishonesty of your trading, 
EZK.28.18	I profaned your sanctuaries 
EZK.28.18	and I brought fire from your midst; 
EZK.28.18	it consumed you, and I have turned you to ashes on the earth 
EZK.28.18	before the eyes of everyone who sees you.
EZK.28.19	All who know you
EZK.28.19	are appalled over you; 
EZK.28.19	you have become as horrors,

EZK.28.20	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.28.21	“Son of man,
EZK.28.22	and you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh:

EZK.28.23	And I will send into it a plague, 
EZK.28.23	and blood will be in its streets. 
EZK.28.23	And the dead will fall in the midst of her 
EZK.28.23	by the sword that is against it from all around; 
EZK.28.23	and they will know that I am Yahweh. 
EZK.28.24	And there will not be any longer
EZK.28.25	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples to which they were scattered about in them, and I show myself holy in

EZK.29.3	the great sea monster, 
EZK.29.3	the one lying down 
EZK.29.3	in the midst of his Nile streams, 
EZK.29.3	who says to me, “It is my Nile, and I made it for myself.”
EZK.29.4	And so I will put hooks in your jawbones, 
EZK.29.4	and I will make the fish of your Nile streams stick to your scales, 
EZK.29.4	and I will bring you up from the midst of your Nile streams, 
EZK.29.4	and all of the fish of your Nile streams which cling to your scales. 
EZK.29.5	And I will fling you to the desert, 
EZK.29.5	you and all the fish of your Nile streams. 
EZK.29.5	On the surface of the field you will fall; 
EZK.29.5	you will not be gathered, 
EZK.29.5	and you will not be assembled. 
EZK.29.5	To the animals
EZK.29.5	and to the birds
EZK.29.5	I will give you as food. 
EZK.29.6	And all of the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh,

EZK.29.7	and you split their every shoulder. 
EZK.29.7	And when they leaned on you, you broke, 
EZK.29.7	and you caused all of their loins to wobble.” 
EZK.29.8	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am bringing on you a sword, and I will cut off from you human and animal. 
EZK.29.9	And the land of Egypt will become
EZK.29.10	Therefore look! I am against you and against your Nile streams, and I will make the land of Egypt into ruins, a pile of rubble, a desolation from Migdol to Syene and up to the boundary of Cush. 
EZK.29.11	A foot of a human will not pass over it, and a foot of an animal will not pass over it, and so it will not be inhabited for forty years.
EZK.29.12	And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated countries, and its cities to be in the midst of ruined cities. They will be a desolation for forty years, and I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and I will disperse them among the countries.” 
EZK.29.13	For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “At the end of forty years I will gather Egypt from the peoples among whom they were scattered. 
EZK.29.14	And I will restore the fortunes of Egypt, and I will bring them back to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and they will be a lowly kingdom there. 
EZK.29.15	Of all the kingdoms it will be the most lowly, and it will not exalt itself again over the nations, and I will make them small so as not to rule over the nations. 
EZK.29.16	And it will not be again for the house of Israel an object of trust, bringing to remembrance their guilt when they turned back to them,

EZK.30.14	And I will lay waste Pathros, 
EZK.30.14	and I will set fire in Zoan, 
EZK.30.14	and I will execute judgments in No.
EZK.30.15	I will pour out my rage over Sin, 
EZK.30.15	the stronghold of Egypt, 
EZK.30.15	and I will cut off the crowd

EZK.30.17	and they will go into captivity. 
EZK.30.18	And at Tahpanhes the day will become dark 
EZK.30.18	when I break the yoke of Egypt,

EZK.30.25	And I will strengthen the arm of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh will fall. And they will know that I am Yahweh when I give my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will stretch it out to the land of Egypt. 
EZK.30.26	And I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and I will disperse them into the countries, and they will know that I am Yahweh.” 
EZK.31.1	And then
EZK.31.2	“Son of man,
EZK.31.2	‘To whom are you like in your greatness? 
EZK.31.3	Look! Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon, 
EZK.31.3	with beautiful branches
EZK.31.3	and very high,
EZK.31.3	and its treetop was between the clouds. 
EZK.31.4	Waters made it great, 
EZK.31.4	the deep made it grow high; 
EZK.31.4	its rivers were going all around its planting area,
EZK.31.4	and its channels it sent out 
EZK.31.4	to all of the trees of the field. 
EZK.31.5	Therefore it became tall, 
EZK.31.5	with its height more than all of the trees of the field, 
EZK.31.5	and its branches became numerous, 
EZK.31.5	and its branches became long 
EZK.31.5	from its sending its shoots from abundant water.
EZK.31.6	In its branches all the birds
EZK.31.6	and under its branches all the animals
EZK.31.6	and in its shadow all the many nations lived. 
EZK.31.7	And it was beautiful in its greatness, 
EZK.31.7	in the length of its branches, 
EZK.31.7	for its root was toward much water. 
EZK.31.8	Cedars in the garden of God 
EZK.31.8	could not be equal to it; 
EZK.31.8	fir trees
EZK.31.8	and plane trees were not even like its branches; 
EZK.31.8	any tree even in the garden of God 
EZK.31.8	could not resemble it in its beauty. 
EZK.31.9	I made it beautiful with the abundance of its branches, 
EZK.31.9	and all of the trees of Eden that were in the garden of God envied it.’ ” 
EZK.31.10	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because
EZK.31.11	then
EZK.31.12	And strangers cut it off, the most ruthless of nations, and they abandoned it. On the mountains and in all of the valleys its branches fell, and its branches were broken in all the river channels of the land, and all the peoples of the world went out from its shadow, and they abandoned it. 
EZK.31.13	On its fallen trunk all the birds
EZK.31.14	This occurred so that all of the trees with abundant water will not become tall, and they will not set their treetop between
EZK.31.15	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “On the day of its going down to Sheol, I caused mourning; I covered over it with the deep, and I withheld its rivers, and many waters were restrained, and I brought gloom over it; Lebanon and all of the trees of the field, they had fainted because of it. 
EZK.31.16	From the sound of its downfall I caused nations to shake when I made it go down to Sheol, with the people going down to the grave,
EZK.31.17	They also went down with it to Sheol to those who died by the sword,
EZK.31.18	To whom could you be compared, whether in glory or in majesty
EZK.32.1	And then
EZK.32.2	“Son of man,
EZK.32.2	‘With a fierce, strong lion among nations you compared yourself, 
EZK.32.2	and you are like the sea monster in the seas, 
EZK.32.2	and you thrash about in your rivers, 
EZK.32.2	and you make water turbid with your feet, 
EZK.32.2	and you make your rivers muddy. 
EZK.32.3	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
EZK.32.3	Now I will spread my net over you 
EZK.32.3	in the assembly of many peoples, 
EZK.32.3	and I will bring you up in my dragnet. 
EZK.32.4	And I will throw you on the ground; 
EZK.32.4	on the surface of the open field I will hurl you, 
EZK.32.4	and I will cause every bird of the heaven to dwell on you, 
EZK.32.4	and I will satisfy the animals
EZK.32.5	And I will put your flesh on the mountains, 
EZK.32.5	and I will fill the valleys with your carcass. 
EZK.32.6	And I will water the land with your discharge from your blood 
EZK.32.6	on the mountains, 
EZK.32.6	and valleys will be filled from
EZK.32.7	And I will cover you at
EZK.32.7	and I will make dark their stars, 
EZK.32.7	and I will cover the sun with the cloud, 
EZK.32.7	and the moon will not give its light. 
EZK.32.8	All
EZK.32.8	I will make them dark over you, 
EZK.32.8	and I will put

EZK.32.9	“And I will disturb the hearts
EZK.32.9	at my bringing about your captivity among the nations, 
EZK.32.9	to countries that you do not know. 
EZK.32.10	And I will cause many peoples to be awestruck over you, 
EZK.32.10	and their kings will shudder over you in horror, 
EZK.32.10	at
EZK.32.10	and they will tremble continually,
EZK.32.10	each person for his life, 
EZK.32.10	on the day of your downfall.” 
EZK.32.11	For thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
EZK.32.11	“The sword of the king of Babylon, 
EZK.32.11	it will come to you. 
EZK.32.12	By the swords of warriors I will cause to fall your hordes 
EZK.32.12	by the most ruthless of the nations, all of them, 
EZK.32.12	and they will devastate the majesty of Egypt, 
EZK.32.12	and all of its hordes will be destroyed. 
EZK.32.13	And I will destroy all her domestic livestock 
EZK.32.13	beside
EZK.32.13	The feet of humans
EZK.32.13	and the hooves of domestic livestock will not make them turbid. 
EZK.32.14	Then I will make their waters settle, 
EZK.32.14	and their rivers as the olive oil I will let flow,” 
EZK.32.14	declares
EZK.32.15	“Then I make the land of Egypt a desolation, 
EZK.32.15	so that the land will be stripped from its fullness 
EZK.32.15	when I strike all of those dwelling in it, 
EZK.32.15	and they will know that I am Yahweh. 
EZK.32.16	This is
EZK.32.17	And then
EZK.32.18	“Son of man,
EZK.32.19	You are more lovely than whom?
EZK.32.20	In the midst of the people slain by the sword it
EZK.32.21	The chiefs of the warriors will speak to him from the middle of Sheol; with his helpers they have gone down; the uncircumcised lie still, those slain by the sword.
EZK.32.22	Assyria is there and all of its assembly; all around it are its graves, all of them killed, those fallen by the sword, 
EZK.32.23	who
EZK.32.24	Elam is there and all of its hordes, all around its grave, all of them dead who fell by the sword, those who went down uncircumcised to the depths of the underworld,
EZK.32.25	In the midst of the slain they made a bed for her with all of her hordes all around its graves, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, for their terror was spread in the land of the living, and they now bear their disgrace with the people going down to the grave;
EZK.32.26	Meshech and Tubal are there and all of its hordes, all around him its graves, all of them uncircumcised and killed by the sword, for they gave their terror in the land of the living. 
EZK.32.27	And they do not lie with warriors fallen from long ago, who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war,
EZK.32.28	And you
EZK.32.29	There is Edom, its kings and all of its leaders who are laid along with their might with those killed by the sword; they will lie with the uncircumcised and with the people going down to the grave.
EZK.32.30	There are also the princes of the north, all of them, all of the Sidonians who have gone down, being ashamed to lie with the slain because
EZK.32.31	Pharaoh will see them, and he will be comforted over all of his hordes killed by the sword, Pharaoh and all of his army,” declares
EZK.32.32	“For
EZK.33.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.33.2	“Son of man,
EZK.33.3	and he sees the sword coming against the land, and he blows on the horn and he warns the people, 
EZK.33.4	and anyone who listens
EZK.33.5	For he heard the sound of the horn and he did not take warning; his blood will be on him. But if he took warning, he saved his life. 
EZK.33.6	And as for the watchman, if he sees the sword coming and he does not blow
EZK.33.7	“And you, son of man,
EZK.33.8	When I say
EZK.33.9	But, you, if you warn the wicked from his way, to turn from it, and he does not turn

EZK.33.11	Say to them, ‘As I live,’
EZK.33.12	“So
EZK.33.13	When I say to the righteous, ‘Certainly he will live,’ and he trusted in
EZK.33.14	And when I say to the wicked, ‘Certainly you will die,’ but
EZK.33.15	for example, the wicked returns a pledge for a loan, he restores stolen property,
EZK.33.16	All of his sins that he committed,
EZK.33.17	“Yet
EZK.33.18	When the righteous turns from his righteousness and does injustice, then he will die because of it.
EZK.33.19	And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and he does justice and righteousness, because of it
EZK.33.20	Yet you said, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair!’ I will judge you, house of Israel, each person according to his ways.” 
EZK.33.21	And then
EZK.33.22	And the hand of Yahweh was on me on the evening before
EZK.33.23	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.33.24	“Son of man,
EZK.33.25	Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “You eat blood in your meat, and you raise your eyes to your idols and you pour out blood, and yet you want to take possession of the land?
EZK.33.26	You rely on your sword, you do a detestable thing, and each man defiles
EZK.33.27	“Thus you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “As I live,
EZK.33.28	And I will make the land a desolation and a wasteland, and the pride of its strength will come to an end, and the mountains of Israel will be desolate with no one traveling through them.” ’
EZK.33.29	And they will know that I am Yahweh when I make my land a desolation and a wasteland, because of all of their detestable things that they have done. 
EZK.33.30	“And you, son of man,
EZK.33.31	And they come to you as people do,
EZK.33.32	Now, look! You are to them like a sensual song,
EZK.33.33	So
EZK.34.1	And the word of Yahweh came
EZK.34.2	“Son of man,
EZK.34.3	The fat you eat, and you clothe yourself with the wool; the well-nourished animals you slaughter, but you do not feed the flock. 
EZK.34.4	The weak you have not strengthened, and the sick you have not healed, and with respect to
EZK.34.5	And they were scattered without
EZK.34.6	My flock went astray upon all of the mountains and on every high hill, and so upon all the surface of the world
EZK.34.7	Therefore, hear, O shepherds, the word of Yahweh: 
EZK.34.8	“As I live,”
EZK.34.9	therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh, 
EZK.34.10	‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am against the shepherds, and I will seek my flock from their hand, and I will put an end to them from shepherding flocks, and the shepherds will no longer
EZK.34.11	“ ‘For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I, even I, will seek my flock, and I will look after them, 
EZK.34.12	just like the caring of a shepherd for his herd on
EZK.34.13	And I will bring them out from the peoples, and I will gather them from the countries, and I will bring them to their soil, and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the valleys, and in all of the settlements of the land. 
EZK.34.14	I will feed them in good pasture, and their pasture will be on the mountains of the heights of Israel; there they will lie down in good pasture, and on lush pasture they will feed on the mountains of Israel. 
EZK.34.15	I myself
EZK.34.16	“I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the scattered, and I will bind up the one hurt, and I will strengthen the sick; and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed her with justice.”

EZK.34.24	And I, Yahweh, I will be for them as God,
EZK.34.25	And I will make them a covenant of peace, and I will put an end to wild animals
EZK.34.26	And I will make them and the area all around my hill a blessing, and I will let the rain go down at its appointed time;
EZK.34.27	And the tree
EZK.34.28	And they will not be any longer plunder to the nations, and the animals of the land will not eat them, and they will dwell in safety,
EZK.34.29	And I will raise for them a garden plot
EZK.34.30	And they will know that I, Yahweh their God, am with them and they are my people, the house of Israel,” declares
EZK.34.31	“and you are my flock, the flock of my pasture. You are my people;
EZK.35.1	And the word of Yahweh came

EZK.35.3	and you must say to it, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am against you, mountain of Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you a desolation and a wasteland. 
EZK.35.4	Your cities I will make ruins, and you will be a desolation, and then you will know that I am Yahweh, 
EZK.35.5	because there has been to you an ancient hostility,
EZK.35.6	Therefore as I live,”
EZK.35.7	And I will make the mountain of Seir into a desolation and ruin, and I will cut off from it both he who is crossing over and he who is returning. 
EZK.35.8	And I will fill its mountains with its slain; your hills and your valleys and all of your watercourses, the slain by the sword will fall in them. 
EZK.35.9	An everlasting desolation
EZK.35.10	I do this because of your saying,
EZK.35.11	Therefore, as I live,”
EZK.35.12	And you will know that I, Yahweh, I have heard all of your contemptible words that you said
EZK.35.13	And you magnified yourself against me with your insolent speech,

EZK.39.17	“And you, son of man,
EZK.39.18	Flesh of warriors you will eat, and the blood of leaders of the land you will drink; rams, young rams and goats, bulls, and the fattened animals of Bashan—all of them! 
EZK.39.19	And you will eat fat until you are satiated,
EZK.39.20	and you will be satisfied at my table with horse and horsemen and warriors and every man of war,” ’ declares
EZK.39.21	“And I will display my glory among the nations, and all of the nations will see my judgment that I have executed and my hand that I have laid upon them. 
EZK.39.22	“And the house of Israel will know that I am Yahweh their God from that day and beyond, 
EZK.39.23	and the nations will know that because of their guilt the house of Israel went into exile, because
EZK.39.24	According to their uncleanness and according to their transgression I dealt with them, and I hid my face from them. 
EZK.39.25	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob, and I will have compassion on all of the house of Israel, and I will be jealous
EZK.39.26	And they will forget their disgrace and all of their infidelity that they displayed against me when they dwelt on their soil in safety
EZK.39.27	When I restore them from the nations and I gather them from the countries of their enemies, then I will show myself holy through them before the eyes of many nations. 
EZK.39.28	And they will know that I am Yahweh their God, because of when I deported them into the nations, and I reassembled them to their soil, and I will not let any of them remain there any longer.

EZK.40.1	In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was destroyed, in this day exactly, the hand of Yahweh was on me, and he brought me there 
EZK.40.2	in visions from God. He brought me to the land of Israel and put me on a very high mountain, and on it was something like a structure of a city to the south. 
EZK.40.3	And he brought me there, and look, there was a man whose
EZK.40.4	And the man spoke to me, “Son of man,
EZK.40.5	And there was a wall on the outside of the temple all the way around it,
EZK.40.6	And then he went toward
EZK.40.7	And the alcove
EZK.40.8	And then he measured the portico of the gate on the inside
EZK.40.9	And he measured the portico of the gate as eight cubits,
EZK.40.10	And the alcoves
EZK.40.11	And he measured the width of the doorway of the gate as ten cubits
EZK.40.12	And a wall
EZK.40.13	And he measured the gate from the top slab of the alcove to its opposite top slab as twenty-five cubits in width, from one entrance to the other one opposite it.
EZK.40.14	And he made the pilasters sixty cubits,
EZK.40.15	And from the front of
EZK.40.16	And there were narrow windows for the alcoves and for their pilasters to the inside of the gate all the way around
EZK.40.17	And he brought me to the outer courtyard, and there were chambers and a pavement made for the courtyard all around it, and thirty chambers were facing to the pavement. 
EZK.40.18	And the pavement flanked
EZK.40.19	And he measured the width from the front of
EZK.40.20	And as for the gate that had its face toward the north
EZK.40.21	And its alcoves were three on each side,
EZK.40.22	And its windows and its porticos and its palm tree images were like the measurement of the gate that was facing toward the east;
EZK.40.23	And a gate led to the inner courtyard, opposite the gate to the north and to the east, and he measured from gate to gate as a hundred cubits.
EZK.40.24	And then he took me toward the south,
EZK.40.25	And there were for it windows and for its porticos all the way around it
EZK.40.26	And seven steps were going up to it and its porticos before them.
EZK.40.27	And there was to the way of the south
EZK.40.28	And he brought me to the inner courtyard through
EZK.40.29	And its alcoves and its pilasters and its porticos were just like these measurements. And it had windows for it and for its porticos
EZK.40.30	And there were porticos all the way around
EZK.40.31	And its porticos were to the outer courtyard, and palm tree images were on its pilasters, and eight steps were for its stairs. 
EZK.40.32	And he brought me to the inner courtyard by way of the east gate, and he measured the gate as just like the other measurements.
EZK.40.33	And its alcoves and its pilasters and its porticos were also like these measurements, and windows were for it and for its porticos all around;
EZK.40.34	And its porticos were toward the outer courtyard, and palm tree images were on its pilasters one each side,
EZK.40.35	And he brought me to the gate of the north, and he measured it; and he measured the same measurements as these others,
EZK.40.36	its alcoves, its pilasters and porticos, and its windows
EZK.40.37	And its pilasters faced the outer courtyard,
EZK.40.38	And a chamber with its doorway was in
EZK.40.39	And in the portico of the gate were two tables on each side
EZK.40.40	And on the outer side as one goes up to the doorway of the gate to the north were two tables, and on the other side, which is toward the portico of the gate, were two tables. 
EZK.40.41	On each side of the gate were four tables,
EZK.40.42	And four tables were for the burnt offering, and made of dressed stones, one cubit and a half
EZK.40.43	And there were double-pronged hooks, one handbreadth in width, put in place in the house
EZK.40.44	And on the outside of the inner gate, there were chambers for
EZK.40.45	And he said to me, “This chamber with its face toward the south
EZK.40.46	And the chamber with its face to the north
EZK.40.47	And he measured the courtyard as to its length, a hundred cubits,
EZK.40.48	And he brought me to the portico of the temple, and he measured the pilaster of the portico, five cubits on each side,
EZK.40.49	The length of the portico was twenty cubits

EZK.41.2	And the width of the doorway was ten cubits,
EZK.41.3	And he went into the inner room, and he measured the pilaster of the doorway as two cubits
EZK.41.4	And he measured its length as twenty cubits
EZK.41.5	And he measured the wall of the temple as six cubits,
EZK.41.6	And the side rooms were side by side
EZK.41.7	And each level widened, and it went around
EZK.41.8	And I saw for the temple a platform all the way around
EZK.41.9	The width of the outside wall, which was for the side room to the outside, was five cubits,
EZK.41.10	and between the chambers was the width of twenty cubits
EZK.41.11	And the doorway of the side room faced
EZK.41.12	And the building that faced

EZK.41.14	And the width of the front of the temple and the courtyard to the east was a hundred cubits.
EZK.41.15	And he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard
EZK.41.16	the thresholds and the framed windows and the galleries around the three of them. Before the threshold was a covering of wood all around,
EZK.41.17	Above
EZK.41.18	and it was made of cherubim and palm tree images; a palm tree image between cherub and cherub, and the cherub had two faces.
EZK.41.19	And the face of a human was toward
EZK.41.20	From the ground up to above
EZK.41.21	As far as the temple is concerned its doorframe was squared, and before
EZK.41.22	a wooden altar
EZK.41.23	And the two doors were for the temple and for the sanctuary. 
EZK.41.24	And two leaves
EZK.41.25	And cherubim were made
EZK.41.26	And narrow windows and palm tree images were on either side,
EZK.42.1	And he brought me out to the outer courtyard to the north,
EZK.42.2	As to
EZK.42.3	Opposite the twenty cubits of the inner courtyard,
EZK.42.4	And in front of
EZK.42.5	And the upper chambers narrowed, for the galleries took away space from them more than they took from the lower levels and more than they took from the middle level in the building. 
EZK.42.6	For they
EZK.42.7	And there was a wall that was to the outside alongside
EZK.42.8	For
EZK.42.9	And from under these chambers was the entrance
EZK.42.10	All along the width of the wall of the courtyard eastward
EZK.42.11	And a walkway was before them
EZK.42.12	and like the doorways of the chambers which were on the way of the south was a doorway at the head of the way
EZK.42.13	And he said to me, “The chambers of the north and the chambers of the south which are before
EZK.42.14	When the priests enter,
EZK.42.15	And he completed the measurements of the inner temple, and he brought me to the walkway of the gate that faces toward the east
EZK.42.16	He measured the east side with the reed
EZK.42.17	He measured the north side as five hundred cubits, with respect to reeds with the reed for measurement all around. 
EZK.42.18	Then he measured the south side as five hundred cubits, with respect to reeds with the reed for measurement. 
EZK.42.19	He went around the west side
EZK.42.20	Toward the four sides
EZK.43.1	And he brought me to the gate which was facing east.
EZK.43.2	And, look! The glory of the God of Israel, it came from the way of the east, and its sound was like the sound of many waters
EZK.43.3	And
EZK.43.4	And then the glory of Yahweh came to the temple by the way of the gate facing east.
EZK.43.5	And the Spirit lifted me and it brought me to the inner courtyard and, look! The glory of Yahweh filled the temple! 
EZK.43.6	And I heard someone speaking to me from the house,
EZK.43.7	And he said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.43.8	When they placed their threshold
EZK.43.9	Now let them send their fornication far away and the offerings for the dead
EZK.43.10	You, son of man,
EZK.43.11	And if they are ashamed of all that they did, then the plan of the temple and its arrangement and its exits and its entrances and all of its plans
EZK.43.12	This is the law
EZK.43.13	And these are the measurements of the altar in the cubits
EZK.43.14	And from the gutter
EZK.43.15	And the altar hearth was four cubits,
EZK.43.16	And the altar hearth was twelve
EZK.43.17	And the ledge was fourteen
EZK.43.18	And he said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.43.19	And you must give to the Levitical priests who are from the offspring of Zadok, the ones coming near me,” declares
EZK.43.20	You must take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar,
EZK.43.21	And you must take the bull, the sin offering, and you must burn it in the designated place of the temple outside of the holy place. 
EZK.43.22	And on the second day you must offer a he-goat without defect as a sin offering, and they must purify the altar like
EZK.43.23	When you are finished
EZK.43.24	And you must bring them near before
EZK.43.25	For seven days you must provide a goat of sin offering for the day and a bull, a calf,
EZK.43.26	Seven days they must purify the altar and they must cleanse it and so they will consecrate it.
EZK.43.27	And they will finish the days, and then
EZK.44.1	And he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary that is facing east, and it was shut. 
EZK.44.2	And Yahweh said to me, “This gate will be shut. It shall not be opened, and no one
EZK.44.3	The prince, he may sit in it to eat food before
EZK.44.4	Then he brought me by the way of the gate of the north to the front of the temple,
EZK.44.5	And Yahweh said, “Son of man,
EZK.44.6	And you must say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Enough for you, house of Israel, of
EZK.44.7	At
EZK.44.8	And you did not observe the responsibility of my sanctuary, but
EZK.44.9	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Every foreigner
EZK.44.10	But
EZK.44.11	Then they will be
EZK.44.12	because
EZK.44.13	And they shall not approach me to serve as a priest for me and to come near to all of
EZK.44.14	And I will appoint them as the keepers of the responsibility of
EZK.44.15	But the Levitical priests, the descendants
EZK.44.16	“They shall come to my sanctuary, and they shall approach my table to serve me, and they will observe my requirement. 
EZK.44.17	And then
EZK.44.18	Linen turbans shall be on their head and linen undergarments shall be on their waists; they shall not gird themselves with material causing perspiration. 
EZK.44.19	When they go out to the outer courtyard to the people, they must take off their garment in which they were serving, and they must place them in the holy chambers,
EZK.44.20	And their head they shall not shave, or long hair they shall not let grow; short they shall clip their heads. 
EZK.44.21	And no priest shall drink wine when they come into the inner courtyard. 
EZK.44.22	And a widow or divorced woman they shall not take for themselves as wives, but only
EZK.44.23	And they will teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is unholy, and the difference between unclean and clean they must show them. 
EZK.44.24	And at a legal dispute they themselves shall stand to judge; employing
EZK.44.25	And near a dead person
EZK.44.26	And, after his
EZK.44.27	and then on the day of his coming into the sanctuary to the inner courtyard to serve in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering,” declares
EZK.44.28	And thus it will be to them as regards inheritance, that I am their inheritance, and so you shall not give to them property in Israel; I am their property. 
EZK.44.29	The grain offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering, they themselves may eat them, and also all the consecrated possessions
EZK.44.30	And also what is first of all of the firstfruits of everything, and of all of the contribution of everything from all of your contributions, to the priest it belongs,
EZK.44.31	Any dead body or mangled carcass from the birds
EZK.45.1	And when you allocate the land as an inheritance, you shall provide a contribution for Yahweh as a holy portion from the land, its length being twenty-five thousand cubits
EZK.45.2	And there shall be from this area five hundred cubits
EZK.45.3	And from this measured area you shall measure a length of twenty-five
EZK.45.4	It
EZK.45.5	And an area twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand cubits in width will be for the Levites, the servants of the temple. It will serve as property for them as cities to dwell in.
EZK.45.6	And as property of the city, you must set apart alongside the contribution of the sanctuary a portion five thousand cubits
EZK.45.7	And a portion will be for
EZK.45.8	This shall be to him with respect to the land
EZK.45.9	Thus says the Lord Yahweh, “Enough of this for you, the princes of Israel; put away violence and destruction and do justice and righteousness; revoke your acts of dispossession from upon
EZK.45.10	There shall be for you an honest set of scales
EZK.45.11	The ephah and the bath shall be one unit of measurement;
EZK.45.12	And the shekel shall weigh twenty gerahs, twenty shekels
EZK.45.13	This is the contribution offering which you shall present: a sixth of the ephah from a
EZK.45.14	And the quota of the olive oil, the bath of the olive oil, is the tenth part of a bath from a kor, which is ten baths, or a homer—for ten baths are equal to a homer. 
EZK.45.15	And one
EZK.45.16	“All of the people of the land shall join in
EZK.45.17	“But on the prince shall be the responsibility for the burnt offerings, and the grain offering, and the libation at the feasts, and at the New Moon festivals, and at
EZK.45.18	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘On the first month on the first day of the month, you shall take a bull, a calf
EZK.45.19	And the priest shall take from the blood of the sin offering, and he shall put it on the doorframe of the temple
EZK.45.20	And so you shall do on the seventh day in the month for anyone doing wrong inadvertently or due to ignorance, and so you must make atonement for the temple.
EZK.45.21	In the first month, on the fourteenth
EZK.45.22	And the prince shall provide on that day for himself
EZK.45.23	And during the seven days of the religious feast he shall provide as a burnt offering to Yahweh seven bulls and seven rams without defect for each of the seven days, and as a sin offering a he-goat for each day. 
EZK.45.24	And as a grain offering, an ephah for
EZK.45.25	In the seventh month, on the fifteenth
EZK.46.1	 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “The gate of the inner courtyard facing east must be shut on
EZK.46.2	And the prince shall come by way of the portico of the gate from the outside, and he shall stand at the doorframe of the gate and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his fellowship offerings, and he shall bow down at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be closed until the evening. 
EZK.46.3	And the people of the land will bow down at the doorway of that gate on the Sabbaths and on the new moons before
EZK.46.4	And the burnt offering which the prince will offer to Yahweh on the Sabbath day must be six male lambs without defect and a ram without defect. 
EZK.46.5	And the grain offering he will give shall be an ephah for each ram,
EZK.46.6	And on the day of the new moon he will offer a bull, a calf
EZK.46.7	And an ephah for each bull and an ephah for the ram he must provide as a grain offering, and also for the male lambs as much as he can afford
EZK.46.8	And when the prince comes, on
EZK.46.9	And when the people of the land come before
EZK.46.10	And the prince will be in the midst of them; he will come in when they come in, and when they go out he will go out. 
EZK.46.11	And at the festivals and at the appointed times, the grain offering will be an ephah with a bull and an ephah with the ram and with the male lambs, as much as he wants to give,
EZK.46.12	And when the prince makes a freewill offering, a burnt offering, or a fellowship offering as a freewill offering to Yahweh, the gate facing east will be open for him. And he must offer his burnt offering and his fellowship offering just as
EZK.46.13	And a male lamb, a yearling
EZK.46.14	And a grain offering he must provide in addition to it every morning,
EZK.46.15	So they must provide the male lamb and the grain offering and the olive oil every morning
EZK.46.16	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “If the prince gives a gift to any one from among his sons, it is his inheritance and it will belong
EZK.46.17	And if he give a gift from his inheritance to one from among his servants, then it will belong
EZK.46.18	But the prince shall not take from the inheritance of the people to rob
EZK.46.19	Then he brought me through the entrance which was on the side of the gate to the holy chambers
EZK.46.20	And he said to me, “This is the place where the priests will boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering in order not to bring them out to the outer courtyard to make the people holy. 
EZK.46.21	And he brought me to the outer courtyard and led me past the four corners of the courtyard; and look, there was a courtyard in each corner of the courtyard.
EZK.46.22	In the four corners of the courtyard were small
EZK.46.23	And a row was all around inside
EZK.46.24	And he said to me, “These are the houses for

EZK.47.2	And he brought me out by the way of the north gate and he led me around by the way leading to the outside of the outer gate
EZK.47.3	As the man went eastward a measuring line was in his hand, and he measured a thousand cubits.
EZK.47.4	And he measured a thousand cubits,
EZK.47.5	And he measured a thousand cubits,
EZK.47.6	And he asked me, “Son of man,
EZK.47.7	When I returned,
EZK.47.8	And he said to me, “These waters are going out to the eastern region, and they go down to the Jordan Valley,
EZK.47.9	And then every living creature with which it teems,
EZK.47.10	And then fishers
EZK.47.11	But its marshes and its swamps will not be cured, for they were given for salt. 
EZK.47.12	And along the stream will go up on its banks from both sides
EZK.47.13	Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “This is the boundary by which you shall distribute the land for the twelve
EZK.47.14	And you must take possession of it, each one a share like his brother, of this land which I swore
EZK.47.15	And
EZK.47.16	Hamath

EZK.47.18	And the eastern boundary
EZK.47.19	And on the south side the border
EZK.47.20	And on the west side
EZK.47.21	You shall divide this land for yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.22	And then you shall allocate it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the aliens dwelling as aliens in the midst of you who have children in the midst of you, and so they shall be to you just like full citizens among the Israelites.
EZK.47.23	And then in the tribe in which an alien who is with you dwells, there you shall give his inheritance,” declares

EZK.48.10	And to these shall be the holy district:
EZK.48.11	To the priests, the ones being consecrated from the descendants
EZK.48.12	And it will be for them a special gift from the contribution of the land as a most holy object
EZK.48.13	And the Levites alongside
EZK.48.14	And they shall not sell any part from it, and shall not exchange, and shall not transfer the best of the land, for it is holy to Yahweh. 
EZK.48.15	And the remaining part
EZK.48.16	And these shall be its measurements: on its side to the north, four thousand five hundred cubits;
EZK.48.17	And a pastureland shall be for the city northwards, two hundred and fifty cubits,
EZK.48.18	And the rest in its length alongside

DAN.1.1	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. 
DAN.1.2	And the Lord gave Jehoiakim the king of Judah into his hand and some of
DAN.1.3	And the king ordered
DAN.1.4	youths who have no physical defect,
DAN.1.5	And the king assigned to them his daily portion
DAN.1.6	Now there was among them from the Judeans,
DAN.1.7	And the commander of the court officials gave them names, and he called Daniel, Belteshazzar; and Hananiah, Shadrach; and Mishael, Meshach; and Azariah, Abednego. 
DAN.1.8	Now Daniel resolved
DAN.1.9	And God
DAN.1.10	and the commander of the court officials said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord, the king, who has determined your food and your drink, for why should
DAN.1.11	Then
DAN.1.12	“Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us some of the vegetables,
DAN.1.13	Then
DAN.1.14	So he agreed to this proposal with them, and he tested them for ten days. 
DAN.1.15	And at the end of ten days their appearances appeared better and they were healthier of body than all the young men who were eating the fine food of the king. 
DAN.1.16	So
DAN.1.17	And as for these four young men,
DAN.1.18	And at the end of the time the king had set to bring them, the commander of the court officials brought them in before
DAN.1.19	And the king spoke with them, and among all of them no one was found like
DAN.1.20	And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired from them, he found them ten times better than all of the magicians
DAN.1.21	And Daniel was there until the first year of Cyrus the king. 
DAN.2.1	Now
DAN.2.2	So the king said to call the magicians
DAN.2.3	And the king said to them, “I have had a dream
DAN.2.4	And the astrologers
DAN.2.5	The king answered and said to the astrologers,
DAN.2.6	But if you tell me the dream and its explanation, you will receive gifts and rewards
DAN.2.7	They answered once more and said, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants and we will make the explanation known.” 
DAN.2.8	The king answered and said, “Certainly
DAN.2.9	for if you do not make the dream known to me, your verdict is fixed,
DAN.2.10	The astrologers
DAN.2.11	And the thing that the king is asking is too difficult and there is no one who
DAN.2.12	Because of this the king became angry, and he became very much enraged, and he said that all the wise men of Babylon are to be destroyed. 
DAN.2.13	And the decree was issued, and the wise men were on the verge of being executed,
DAN.2.14	Then Daniel responded prudently and discretely to Arioch, the commander of the imperial guard of the king, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.15	He asked
DAN.2.16	And Daniel went in and requested from the king that he would give him time, and he would tell the king
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went to his home, and he made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, his companions, 
DAN.2.18	and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven
DAN.2.19	Then in a vision of the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel; then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 
DAN.2.20	Daniel said:
DAN.2.20	“Let his name, the name of God,
DAN.2.20	for the wisdom and the power are his.
DAN.2.21	And he changes the times and the seasons, 
DAN.2.21	and he deposes kings and he sets up kings; 
DAN.2.21	he gives wisdom
DAN.2.21	and knowledge to men who know understanding. 
DAN.2.22	He reveals the deep and the hidden things; 
DAN.2.22	he knows what is in the darkness, 
DAN.2.22	and the light dwells with him. 
DAN.2.23	To you, O God of my ancestors,
DAN.2.23	I give thanks and I give praises, 
DAN.2.23	for the wisdom and the power you gave to me, 
DAN.2.23	and now you have made known to me 
DAN.2.23	what we have asked from you, 
DAN.2.23	for you have made known to us the matter of the king.” 
DAN.2.24	Therefore
DAN.2.25	Then Arioch quickly
DAN.2.26	The king then asked
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered the king and said, “The mystery that the king asks, no wise men, conjurers,
DAN.2.28	But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what it is that will be at the end of days. This is your dream and the visions of your head on your bed. 
DAN.2.29	“As for you, king,
DAN.2.30	And as for me, it is not because of wisdom that is in me more than any other living person
DAN.2.31	“You, O king, were looking and, look, there was one great statue. This statue was huge and its brilliance extraordinary, standing there before you, and its appearance was frightening.
DAN.2.32	The head of this statue was of fine gold, its chest and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze, 
DAN.2.33	its legs of iron, its feet, part of them of iron and part of them of clay. 
DAN.2.34	You were looking on until
DAN.2.35	Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold all at once
DAN.2.36	“This was the dream, and now we will tell its interpretation to the king. 
DAN.2.37	You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power and the might and the glory, 
DAN.2.38	and also human beings wherever they dwell,
DAN.2.39	And after you another kingdom inferior to yours will arise, and another third kingdom of bronze that will rule over the whole earth. 
DAN.2.40	And a fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, and just as
DAN.2.41	And just as
DAN.2.42	And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so part of the kingdom will be strong and partly brittle.
DAN.2.43	And in that you saw the iron was mixed with wet clay, so they will mix in marriage
DAN.2.44	And in the day of those kings,
DAN.2.45	Inasmuch as
DAN.2.46	Then the king, Nebuchadnezzar, fell on his face and he paid homage to Daniel; and he commanded them to offer a grain offering and incense offering to him. 
DAN.2.47	The king answered Daniel and said, “Truly
DAN.2.48	Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and the chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.49	And Daniel made a request from the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel remained in the court of the king. 
DAN.3.1	Nebuchadnezzar the king made a statue of gold. Its height was sixty cubits and its width was six cubits; he set it up in the valley of Dura in the province of Babylon. 
DAN.3.2	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent directions to assemble the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all of the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. 
DAN.3.3	Then the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the province were assembled for the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up, and were standing before
DAN.3.4	Then the herald proclaimed aloud,
DAN.3.5	that at the time that you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the trigon, the harp, the drum and all kinds of music, you must fall down and you must worship the statue of gold
DAN.3.6	And whoever
DAN.3.7	Therefore,
DAN.3.8	Therefore
DAN.3.9	They responded and said
DAN.3.10	You, O king, have made a decree that everyone
DAN.3.11	And whoever
DAN.3.12	However there are Judean men whom you have appointed
DAN.3.13	Then Nebuchadnezzar said in rage and anger to bring in Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego; then they brought in these men before the king. 
DAN.3.14	Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you are not serving my god, and you are not worshiping the statue of gold
DAN.3.15	Now if you are ready so that when
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king, Nebuchadnezzar, “We have no need on this matter to present a defense to you.
DAN.3.17	If it is so,
DAN.3.18	And if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods,
DAN.3.19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with anger and the image of his face was changed toward
DAN.3.20	And he commanded the strongest men of the guards
DAN.3.21	Then these men were bound with their garments, their trousers and their turbans and their other clothing, and they were thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire. 
DAN.3.22	Therefore
DAN.3.23	But these men, the three of them, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, fell down into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire, and they were bound. 
DAN.3.24	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and he rose up in haste and he asked, saying to his advisers, “Did we not throw three men, bound, into the midst of the fire? They answered, saying to the king, “Certainly, O king!” 
DAN.3.25	He answered,
DAN.3.26	Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire, and he called out, saying, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants
DAN.3.27	And the satraps, the prefects, the governors and the advisors of the king were assembling, and they saw these men, that the fire had no power over their bodies, and the hair of their heads was
DAN.3.28	Nebuchadnezzar responded,
DAN.3.29	And from me is set forth
DAN.3.30	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon. 
DAN.4.1	 Nebuchadnezzar the king to all of the nations, the peoples and languages that live in the whole earth: “May your prosperity increase! 
DAN.4.2	It is pleasing to me to recount the signs and wonders that the Most High God worked for me. 
DAN.4.3	How great are his signs and wonders, how strong is his kingdom, an everlasting kingdom;
DAN.4.4	“I, Nebuchadnezzar, was content in my house and prospering in my palace. 
DAN.4.5	And I saw a dream and a revelation on my bed and it frightened me, and the visions of my head terrified me. 
DAN.4.6	And a decree was sent out,
DAN.4.7	Then the magicians,
DAN.4.8	Then at last
DAN.4.9	“ ‘O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians,
DAN.4.10	Now these were the visions of my head as I was lying on my bed: I was gazing
DAN.4.11	The tree grew and it became strong, 
DAN.4.11	and its height reached to heaven,
DAN.4.11	and it was visible to the end of the whole earth.
DAN.4.12	Its foliage was beautiful, 
DAN.4.12	and its fruit abundant, 
DAN.4.12	and in it was provision for all. 
DAN.4.12	Under it the animals
DAN.4.12	and in its branches the birds of heaven
DAN.4.12	and from it all the living beings were fed. 
DAN.4.13	“ ‘I was looking in the vision of my head as I lay on my bed, and look, a watcher,
DAN.4.14	He cried aloud
DAN.4.14	“Cut down the tree and chop off its branches; 
DAN.4.14	shake off its foliage and scatter its fruit. 
DAN.4.14	Let the animals flee from under it, 
DAN.4.14	and the birds from its branches. 
DAN.4.15	But the stump of its roots 
DAN.4.15	leave in the earth, 
DAN.4.15	along with
DAN.4.15	leave it in the grass of the field. 
DAN.4.15	And in
DAN.4.15	let it
DAN.4.15	and with the animals
DAN.4.15	let his lot be in the grass of the earth. 
DAN.4.16	Let his mind be changed from that of a human,
DAN.4.16	and let the mind of an animal be given to him, 
DAN.4.16	and let seven times pass over him. 
DAN.4.17	The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, 
DAN.4.17	and the decision by the command of the holy ones, 
DAN.4.17	in order that
DAN.4.17	that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdom of humankind, 
DAN.4.17	and to whomever
DAN.4.17	and he even sets the humblest of men over it.” 
DAN.4.18	“ ‘This is the dream that I, Nebuchadnezzar the king, saw. Now
DAN.4.19	“Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was distressed for some time,
DAN.4.20	The tree that you saw, which grew and became strong and its height reached to heaven
DAN.4.21	and its foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, and so there was provision for all in it, and the animals
DAN.4.22	—it is you, O king, who have grown great and you have grown strong, and so your greatness has increased and it has reached to heaven
DAN.4.23	And inasmuch that the king saw the watcher, a holy one coming down from heaven
DAN.4.24	This is the explanation, O king, and it is a decree of the Most High that has come upon my lord the king: 
DAN.4.25	you will be driven away from human society
DAN.4.26	And in that
DAN.4.27	Therefore, O king, let my advice be acceptable to you and your sin remove
DAN.4.28	All this happened
DAN.4.29	At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace
DAN.4.30	And the king answered and said, “Is this not the great Babylon which I have built as a royal palace by the strength of my own power, and for the glory of my own majesty?” 
DAN.4.31	While the words were still in the mouth of the king, a voice from heaven came, saying, ‘To you, King Nebuchadnezzar, it is declared that the kingdom has departed from you, 
DAN.4.32	and you will be driven away from human society
DAN.4.33	Immediately
DAN.4.34	“But at the end of that period,
DAN.4.34	“For his sovereignty is an everlasting sovereignty, 
DAN.4.34	and his kingdom continues from generation to generation. 
DAN.4.35	And all the dwellers of the earth 
DAN.4.35	are regarded as nothing, 
DAN.4.35	and he does according to
DAN.4.35	in the host of heaven and among the dwellers of earth, 
DAN.4.35	and there is not one who can hold back his hand, 
DAN.4.35	or ask him,
DAN.4.36	“At that time
DAN.4.37	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor the king of heaven, for all his works are truth,
DAN.5.1	Belshazzar the king made a great festival for a thousand of his lords,
DAN.5.2	When he tasted the wine,
DAN.5.3	Then they brought in the vessels of gold that they took from the temple, the house of God that was in Jerusalem, and the king and his lords,
DAN.5.4	They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood and stone.
DAN.5.5	Immediately
DAN.5.6	Then his face changed and his thoughts terrified him, and his hip joints gave way
DAN.5.7	The king cried aloud
DAN.5.8	Then all the wise men of the king came in, but they were not able to read the writing or to make known its explanation.
DAN.5.9	Then the king, Belshazzar, became greatly terrified, and his facial features
DAN.5.10	Because of the words of the king and his lords,
DAN.5.11	There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him.
DAN.5.12	because
DAN.5.13	Then Daniel was brought in before the king, and the king spoke
DAN.5.14	And I have heard that a spirit of the gods is in you and enlightenment and insight and excellent wisdom was found in you. 
DAN.5.15	And now the wise men and the conjurers
DAN.5.16	But I have heard concerning you that you are able to produce interpretations
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered and said before the king, “Let your gifts be for yourself or your rewards give to another; nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and I will make known to him the explanation.
DAN.5.18	O king,
DAN.5.19	And because of the greatness that he gave to him, all the peoples, the nations and languages trembled and feared before him; whomever he wanted he killed, and whomever he wanted he let live, and whomever he wanted he honored, and whomever he wanted he humbled. 
DAN.5.20	But when
DAN.5.21	And he was driven away from human society
DAN.5.22	“But you his successor,
DAN.5.23	And now you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven, and the vessels of his temple you have brought in before you, and you and your lords,
DAN.5.24	So then the palm of the hand was sent out from his presence and this writing was inscribed. 
DAN.5.25	“Now this was the writing that was inscribed: ‘Mene, Mene, Tekel and Parsin.’ 
DAN.5.26	“This is the explanation of the matter:
DAN.5.27	“ ‘Tekel’—you have been weighed on scales and you have been found wanting.
DAN.5.28	“ ‘Peres’—your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians.’ ” 
DAN.5.29	Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple and placed a necklace of gold around his neck, and they made a proclamation concerning him that he would be the third ruler in authority in the kingdom. 
DAN.5.30	That same night
DAN.5.31	 And Darius the Mede received the kingdom when he was about sixty-two years old.
DAN.6.1	It pleased Darius,
DAN.6.2	and over them were three administrators, of whom Daniel was one, so that these satraps were giving account to them, and the king would not be suffering loss. 
DAN.6.3	Then Daniel began distinguishing himself
DAN.6.4	Then the other administrators and satraps began to seek
DAN.6.5	Then these men said,
DAN.6.6	So the administrators and the satraps conspired with respect to
DAN.6.7	All of the administrators of the kingdom, and the prefects, the satraps, the counselors and the governors took counsel and have agreed to establish an edict of the king and to enforce a decree that whoever
DAN.6.8	Now, O king, establish the edict and you must sign the document so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians which cannot be revoked.” 
DAN.6.9	So
DAN.6.10	Now when
DAN.6.11	Then these men came as a group and they found Daniel praying and pleading for mercy before his God. 
DAN.6.12	Then they approached and spoke with the king
DAN.6.13	Then they responded
DAN.6.14	Then the king, when
DAN.6.15	Then these men came as a group to the king and said,
DAN.6.16	Then the king gave the command, and Daniel was brought in and they threw him into the lion pit.
DAN.6.17	And a
DAN.6.18	Then the king went to his palace and spent the night in fasting, and no food was brought in before him and his sleep fled from him. 
DAN.6.19	Then the king got up at daybreak, at first light, and he went in haste
DAN.6.20	And when he came near
DAN.6.21	Then Daniel spoke to
DAN.6.22	My God sent his angel and he shut the mouth of the lions and they did not
DAN.6.23	Then the king was exceedingly glad over it
DAN.6.24	The king then commanded, and these men were brought who had accused Daniel,
DAN.6.25	Then Darius the king wrote to all the people, the nations, and the languages living in the whole earth, “May your prosperity become great! 
DAN.6.26	I make a decree
DAN.6.27	He is rescuing, delivering, and working signs and wonders in the heavens and on earth, for he has rescued Daniel from the power
DAN.6.28	So this Daniel prospered during the kingdom of Darius and during the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian. 
DAN.7.1	In the first year of Belshazzar the king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions
DAN.7.2	Daniel explained
DAN.7.3	And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, differing from one another.
DAN.7.4	The first was like a lion and had
DAN.7.5	And look, another beast, a second one, looking like a bear. And it was raised up on one side and three tusks
DAN.7.6	After this I was watching and look, another beast like a leopard; it had four wings
DAN.7.7	After this in the visions of the night I was looking and there was a fourth beast, terrifying and frightful and exceedingly strong, and it had
DAN.7.8	I was considering the horns, and look, another little horn came up among
DAN.7.9	“I continued watching
DAN.7.10	A stream of fire issued forth and flowed from his presence;
DAN.7.11	“I continued watching
DAN.7.12	And as for the remainder of the beasts, their dominion was taken away,
DAN.7.13	“I continued watching
DAN.7.14	And to him was given dominion and glory and kingship that
DAN.7.15	“As for me, Daniel,
DAN.7.16	So I approached one of the attendants and I asked him
DAN.7.17	‘These great beasts which are four in number are four kings who will arise from the earth. 
DAN.7.18	But the holy ones
DAN.7.19	“Then I desired to make certain concerning the fourth beast that was different from all the others
DAN.7.20	and concerning the horns that were on its head, and concerning the other horn that came up and before which three horns fell,
DAN.7.21	I continued watching,
DAN.7.22	until the Ancient of Days came and gave judgment to the holy ones
DAN.7.23	“And he said, ‘The fourth beast is the fourth kingdom that will be on the earth that will be different from all the other kingdoms, and it will devour the whole earth and it will trample it and it will crush it. 
DAN.7.24	And as for the ten horns coming from it, from this kingdom
DAN.7.25	And he will speak words against the Most High, and he will wear out the holy ones
DAN.7.26	Then the court will sit, and his dominion will be removed,
DAN.7.27	And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the nation of the holy ones
DAN.7.28	This is the end of the account.
DAN.8.1	In the third year of the kingdom of Belshazzar the king, a vision appeared to me, Daniel,
DAN.8.2	And I saw in the vision, and when I saw,
DAN.8.3	And I lifted up my eyes and I saw, and look! A ram
DAN.8.4	I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward, and none of the beasts stood before it,
DAN.8.5	And I was considering this, and look, a he-goat coming from the west across the face of the whole earth, and it was not touching the ground;
DAN.8.6	Then it came toward the ram that had the two horns
DAN.8.7	And I saw it approaching the ram and it was furious at it, and it struck the ram, and it broke its two horns, and there was not strength in the ram to stand before him,
DAN.8.8	And the he-goat grew exceedingly great,
DAN.8.9	And from one of them
DAN.8.10	And it grew up to the host of heaven, and it threw down to the ground some of the host and some of the stars and trampled them. 
DAN.8.11	Even against the prince of the hosts it acted arrogantly and took away from him the regular burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown. 
DAN.8.12	And on account of transgression, the host was given over to the horn in addition to the regular burnt offering. And it cast down truth to the ground, and it acted,
DAN.8.13	And I heard a certain holy one speaking, and a certain other holy one said to the specific one who was speaking,
DAN.8.14	And he said to me, “For two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings, then the sanctuary will be restored.” 
DAN.8.15	And then
DAN.8.16	And I heard the voice of a human at the Ulai, and he called and said, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.” 
DAN.8.17	And he came beside where I was standing,
DAN.8.18	And when he spoke
DAN.8.19	And he said, “Look, I am making known to you what will happen in the period of wrath,
DAN.8.20	“The ram that you saw who had two horns
DAN.8.21	“And the hairy he-goat is the kingdom
DAN.8.22	And the horn that was broken, and then there arose four horns in place of it—these are four kingdoms that will arise from his nation, but not with his power. 
DAN.8.23	And at the end of their kingdom, when the transgressions are completed, a king will arise, fierce in countenance and skilled in riddles. 
DAN.8.24	And his power will grow, but not by his own power, and he will cause fearful destruction, and he will succeed and he will act,
DAN.8.25	And by his planning
DAN.8.26	And the vision of the evening and the morning that has been described,
DAN.8.27	And I, Daniel, was overcome, and I became ill for some days, and I performed
DAN.9.1	In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus,
DAN.9.2	in the first year of his kingship I, Daniel, observed in the scrolls the number of the years that it was that were to be fulfilled according to the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah the prophet for the devastation of Jerusalem—seventy years. 
DAN.9.3	Then I turned my face to the Lord God to seek him by prayer and pleas for mercy,
DAN.9.4	And I prayed to Yahweh my God, and I made confession and I said, “O Lord, the great and awesome God, keeping the covenant and loyal love with those who love him and with those who keep his commandments, 
DAN.9.5	we have sinned and we have done wrong and we acted wickedly and we rebelled and have been turning aside from your commandments and from your ordinances. 
DAN.9.6	We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our ancestors
DAN.9.7	“Righteousness belongs to you, O Lord,
DAN.9.8	Yahweh, on us is open shame, on our kings, on our princes, and on our ancestors,
DAN.9.9	Compassion and forgiveness belong to the Lord, our God,
DAN.9.10	and we have not listened to the voice of Yahweh our God, by following his law which he placed before us
DAN.9.11	“And all Israel transgressed your law and turned aside so as not to listen to your voice, and so the curse and the oath which was written in the law of Moses, the servant of God, has been poured out upon us, because we have sinned against him. 
DAN.9.12	And so he has carried out his words which he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled us, to bring upon us a great calamity which was not done under all of heaven as it was done in Jerusalem. 
DAN.9.13	Just as it is written in the law of Moses, all of this calamity has come upon us, and we have not implored
DAN.9.14	So Yahweh has kept watch over the
DAN.9.15	“And now, Lord our God, who have brought your people out from the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and you have made for yourself a name until this day—we have sinned, we have acted wickedly. 
DAN.9.16	Lord, according to all your righteousness, please let your anger and your rage turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain,
DAN.9.17	“And now, listen to the prayer of your servant and to his pleas for mercy. Shine
DAN.9.18	Incline your ear, my God, and listen; open your eyes and look at our desolation and the city that is called by your name, for we are not presenting our pleas for mercy before you
DAN.9.19	Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, pay heed and act! You must not delay for your sake,
DAN.9.20	Now I was still speaking and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea before
DAN.9.21	And I was still speaking in prayer, and the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision previously,
DAN.9.22	And he instructed me and he spoke with me and he said, “Daniel I have now come out
DAN.9.23	At the beginning of your pleas for mercy, a word went out, and now I have come to declare
DAN.9.24	“Seventy weeks is decreed for your people and for your holy city,
DAN.9.25	And you must know and you must understand
DAN.9.26	“And after the sixty and two weeks an anointed one
DAN.9.27	And he will make a strong covenant with the many for one week, but in half of the week he will let cease sacrifice and offering and in its place
DAN.10.1	In the third year of Cyrus the king of the Persians, a word
DAN.10.2	In those days, I, Daniel, I myself
DAN.10.3	I had not eaten any choice food, and meat and wine did not enter my mouth, and I did not use any ointment
DAN.10.4	And then on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I myself
DAN.10.5	And I lifted up my eyes and I saw,
DAN.10.6	Now his body was like turquoise,
DAN.10.7	And I saw, I, Daniel alone,
DAN.10.8	And I myself, Daniel, alone saw this great vision, and as a result no strength was left in me
DAN.10.9	And I heard the sound of his words, and when I heard
DAN.10.10	And look, a hand touched me and it roused me to my knees
DAN.10.11	And he said to me, “Daniel, a man beloved, pay attention to the words that I am speaking to you and stand upright where you are,
DAN.10.12	And he said to me, “You must not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and to humble yourself before
DAN.10.13	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia stood before me
DAN.10.14	And I have come
DAN.10.15	And while he was speaking with me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and I was speechless. 
DAN.10.16	Then look, there was one in the form of a human;
DAN.10.17	So how am I, a servant of my lord
DAN.10.18	And he again touched
DAN.10.19	And he said, “You must not fear, O beloved man. Peace be to you;
DAN.10.20	Then he asked, “Do you know why I have come to you? And now I return to fight against the prince of Persia and I myself
DAN.10.21	However, I will tell you what is inscribed
DAN.11.1	“And I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood
DAN.11.2	And now I will reveal the truth to you. Look! Still three kings will arise in Persia, and the fourth will get abundance and great wealth, even more than all of them, and when he becomes strong
DAN.11.3	And a mighty king will arise, and he will rule with great dominion, and he will do as he pleases.
DAN.11.4	But as he rises in power,
DAN.11.5	“Then the king of the south will grow strong and also one of his officials,
DAN.11.6	And at the end of some years they will make an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make a peace treaty, but she will not retain her position of power,
DAN.11.7	And a branch from her roots
DAN.11.8	And also their gods with their idols and with the precious vessels,
DAN.11.9	And then he
DAN.11.10	“But his sons will wage war and they will gather a multitude of great forces and he will advance with great force,
DAN.11.11	And the king of the south will become furious, and he will go and he will battle against him, against the king of the north; and he will muster a great multitude, and the multitude will be given into his hand. 
DAN.11.12	When the multitude is carried off, his heart will be exalted and he will overthrow tens of thousands,
DAN.11.13	And the king of the north will again raise a multitude, greater than the former, and at the end of some years
DAN.11.14	“And in these times many will rise up against the king of the south, and the violent ones of your people
DAN.11.15	And the king of the north will come, and he will throw up siege ramps
DAN.11.16	And the one coming to him will act according to
DAN.11.17	And he will set his face to come with the authority of his whole kingdom and will form an agreement;
DAN.11.18	And he will turn his face to the coastlands, and he will capture many, but
DAN.11.19	And he will turn back his face toward
DAN.11.20	“Then in his place will arise one sending an official throughout the glory
DAN.11.21	And in his place a despicable person will arise on whom
DAN.11.22	And before him
DAN.11.23	And after an alliance is made with him, he will act deceitfully, and he will rise and he will become powerful with few people backing him. 
DAN.11.24	In a time of ease and in the rich parts of the province, he will come and he will do what his predecessors
DAN.11.25	And he will stir up his power and his heart against the king of the south and with a much greater and stronger army;
DAN.11.26	And those who eat of his royal rations will break him and his army will be overwhelmed, and many will fall, slain. 
DAN.11.27	And two of the kings
DAN.11.28	Then he will return to his land with many possessions, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant,
DAN.11.29	“At the appointed time he will return and he will come into the south, but it will not be as it was before.
DAN.11.30	And the ships of Kittim will come against him, and he will lose heart, and he will turn back, and he will be enraged against the holy covenant,
DAN.11.31	And military forces from him will occupy
DAN.11.32	“And those who violate the covenant he will seduce with flattery, but the persons who know their God
DAN.11.33	And those who have insight will instruct
DAN.11.34	And when they fall
DAN.11.35	And even some of those who have insight﻿
DAN.11.36	“Then the king will do as he pleases,
DAN.11.37	He will not pay respect to the gods of his ancestors,
DAN.11.38	But instead
DAN.11.39	And he will deal with the fortified strongholds
DAN.11.40	“And at the time of the end the king of the south will attack him, and the king of the north will storm against him with chariots
DAN.11.41	And he will come into the beautiful land
DAN.11.42	And he will stretch out his hand against countries and the land of Egypt will not escape.
DAN.11.43	And he will rule over the treasures of gold and the silver and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Cushites will follow in his footsteps. 
DAN.11.44	But reports will terrify him from the east and from the north, and he will go out with great fury to destroy and to exterminate many. 
DAN.11.45	And then he will pitch the tents of his palace between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain,
DAN.12.1	“Now at that time, Michael, the great prince, will arise, the protector
DAN.12.2	And many from those sleeping in the dusty ground
DAN.12.3	But the ones having insight will shine like the brightness of the expanse, and the ones providing justice for the many
DAN.12.4	But you, Daniel, keep the words secret and seal the scroll
DAN.12.5	Then I looked, I myself, Daniel, and look, there were two others standing: one on this bank of the stream and one on the other.
DAN.12.6	Then he said to the man who was clothed in linen who was above
DAN.12.7	And I heard the man who was clothed in linen who was above
DAN.12.8	Now I myself heard, but I did not understand, and I said, “My lord, what will be the outcome of these things?” 
DAN.12.9	And he said, “Go, Daniel, for the words are secret and are sealed up until the time of the end. 
DAN.12.10	Many will be purified and will be cleansed and will be refined, but the wicked will act wickedly and none of the wicked will understand,
DAN.12.11	And from the time the regular burnt offering is removed and the abomination that causes desolation is set up
DAN.12.12	Happy is the one who is persevering, and attains to the one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days. 
DAN.12.13	But you, go on to the end and rest, and you will arise for your allotted inheritance at the end of the days.” 
HOS.1.1	The word of Yahweh that came to Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. 
HOS.1.2	At the beginning when Yahweh spoke
HOS.1.2	Yahweh said to Hosea, 
HOS.1.2	“Go, take for yourself a wife and children of whoredom, 
HOS.1.2	because the land commits great whoredom 
HOS.1.2	forsaking Yahweh.”
HOS.1.3	So he went and took Gomer daughter of Diblaim, 
HOS.1.3	and she conceived and bore him a son. 
HOS.1.4	And Yahweh said to him, 
HOS.1.4	“Name him
HOS.1.4	because in a little while I will punish
HOS.1.4	for the blood
HOS.1.4	and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
HOS.1.5	On that day
HOS.1.5	I will break the bow of Israel 
HOS.1.5	in the Valley of Jezreel.” 
HOS.1.6	And she conceived again and bore a daughter, and he
HOS.1.6	“Name her
HOS.1.6	for I will no longer have pity 
HOS.1.6	on the house of Israel 
HOS.1.6	or forgive them.
HOS.1.7	But I will have pity on the house of Judah 
HOS.1.7	and I will save them by Yahweh their God, 
HOS.1.7	and will not deliver them 
HOS.1.7	by bow, sword, war, 
HOS.1.7	horses, or horsemen. 
HOS.1.8	And when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah,
HOS.1.9	And he
HOS.1.9	for you are not my people 
HOS.1.9	and I am not your God.
HOS.1.10	 The number of the children of Israel 
HOS.1.10	will be like the sand of the sea 
HOS.1.10	that cannot be measured or counted; 
HOS.1.10	and in the place where it is said to them, 
HOS.1.10	“You are not my people,” 
HOS.1.10	it will be said to them, 
HOS.1.10	“Children of the living God.” 
HOS.1.11	Then the children of Judah 
HOS.1.11	and Israel will be gathered together, 
HOS.1.11	and they will appoint for themselves 
HOS.1.11	one head; 
HOS.1.11	and they will take possession of
HOS.1.11	for great is the day of Jezreel.
HOS.2.1	Say to your brother,
HOS.2.1	and to your sister,
HOS.2.2	Plead with your mother, plead— 
HOS.2.2	because she is not my wife, 
HOS.2.2	and I am not her husband. 
HOS.2.2	Let her put away her whoring from before her,
HOS.2.2	and her adultery from between her breasts. 
HOS.2.3	Lest I strip her naked 
HOS.2.3	and expose her like the day when she was born; 
HOS.2.3	I will make her like the desert 
HOS.2.3	and turn her into parched land; 
HOS.2.3	I will kill her with thirst. 
HOS.2.4	And I will not have pity on her children, 
HOS.2.4	because they are children of whoredom. 
HOS.2.5	Because their mother was unfaithful;
HOS.2.5	she who conceived them has acted shamefully, 
HOS.2.5	for she said: 
HOS.2.5	“I will go after my lovers, 
HOS.2.5	the ones who give me my bread, my water, 
HOS.2.5	my wool, and my flax, 
HOS.2.5	my oil, and my drink.” 
HOS.2.6	Therefore, Look! 
HOS.2.6	I am going to hedge her path
HOS.2.6	and I will build a stone wall, a stone wall against her, 
HOS.2.6	and she will not find her paths. 
HOS.2.7	Then she will pursue her lovers,
HOS.2.7	but she will not overtake them; 
HOS.2.7	she will seek them and not find them; 
HOS.2.7	and she will say, “I will go 
HOS.2.7	and return to my first husband 
HOS.2.7	because it was better for me then than now.” 
HOS.2.8	But she did not know 
HOS.2.8	that it was I who gave her 
HOS.2.8	grain, new wine, and oil, 
HOS.2.8	and who gave her silver in abundance, 
HOS.2.8	and gold which they made into a Baal. 
HOS.2.9	Therefore I will take again 
HOS.2.9	my grain in its time, 
HOS.2.9	and my wine in its season; 
HOS.2.9	and I will take away my wool and my flax, 
HOS.2.9	which were to cover her nakedness. 
HOS.2.10	And now I will uncover her nakedness 
HOS.2.10	before the eyes of her lovers, 
HOS.2.10	and no one will rescue her from my hand. 
HOS.2.11	And I will put an end to all her mirth, 
HOS.2.11	her festivals,
HOS.2.11	and all her appointed festivals;
HOS.2.12	and I will lay waste to her vines
HOS.2.12	of which she said, 
HOS.2.12	“They are my payment for prostitution, 
HOS.2.12	which my lovers gave to me.” 
HOS.2.12	I will make them a forest, 
HOS.2.12	and the wild animals
HOS.2.13	I will punish her
HOS.2.13	to whom she burns incense, 
HOS.2.13	and she decked herself with her ornamental ring and jewelry, 
HOS.2.13	and she went after her lovers, and forgot me 
HOS.2.13	—a declaration of Yahweh. 
HOS.2.14	Therefore, Look! I am going to allure her 
HOS.2.14	and bring her into the desert, 
HOS.2.14	and I will speak tenderly to her.
HOS.2.15	From there I will give her 
HOS.2.15	her vineyards, 
HOS.2.15	and the Valley of Achor as a doorway of hope. 
HOS.2.15	And there she will respond, 
HOS.2.15	as in the days of her youth, 
HOS.2.15	just as in the day of her coming out of 
HOS.2.15	the land of Egypt. 
HOS.2.16	And on that day—
HOS.2.16	a declaration of Yahweh— 
HOS.2.16	you will call me, “My husband;”
HOS.2.16	you will no longer call me, “My Baal.”
HOS.2.17	I will remove the names 
HOS.2.17	of the Baals from her mouth, 
HOS.2.17	and they will no longer be mentioned by their name. 
HOS.2.18	I will make a covenant for them on that day, 
HOS.2.18	with the animals
HOS.2.18	with the birds
HOS.2.18	with the creeping things
HOS.2.18	the bow, the sword, and the war I will abolish from the land, and I will let them lie down in safety. 
HOS.2.19	And I will take you as my wife forever; 
HOS.2.19	I will take you as a wife for myself in righteousness and in justice, 
HOS.2.19	in steadfast love and in mercy. 
HOS.2.20	I will take you as my wife
HOS.2.20	and you will know Yahweh. 
HOS.2.21	On that day I will answer, declares Yahweh,
HOS.2.21	I will answer the heavens, 
HOS.2.21	and they will answer the earth. 
HOS.2.22	And the earth will answer 
HOS.2.22	the grain, the wine, and the oil, 
HOS.2.22	and they will answer Jezreel.
HOS.2.23	I will sow her for myself in the land; 
HOS.2.23	I will have pity on Lo-ruhama;
HOS.2.23	I will say to Lo-ammi,
HOS.2.23	“You are my people,” 
HOS.2.23	and he himself will say, “you are my God.” 
HOS.3.1	And Yahweh said to me again, 
HOS.3.1	“Go, love a woman 
HOS.3.1	who has a lover
HOS.3.1	just like the love of Yahweh for the children of Israel, 
HOS.3.1	but they are turning to other gods 
HOS.3.1	and love raisin cakes.” 
HOS.3.2	So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver 
HOS.3.2	and a homer of barely and a measure of wine.
HOS.3.3	And I said to her, 
HOS.3.3	“You must remain as mine
HOS.3.3	and you will not play the whore; 
HOS.3.3	you will not belong
HOS.3.3	and I will belong to you.” 
HOS.3.4	The children of Israel will remain for many days 
HOS.3.4	without a king and prince, 
HOS.3.4	without sacrifice and stone pillar, ephod and teraphim. 
HOS.3.5	Afterward the children of Israel will return 
HOS.3.5	and seek Yahweh their God and David their king. 
HOS.3.5	They will come in fear to Yahweh 
HOS.3.5	and to his goodness at the end of days. 
HOS.4.1	Hear the word of Yahweh, O children of Israel, 
HOS.4.1	for Yahweh has an indictment against the inhabitants of the land. 
HOS.4.1	There is no faithfulness or loyalty, 
HOS.4.1	there is no knowledge of God in the land. 
HOS.4.2	Swearing and lying, 
HOS.4.2	murdering and stealing, 
HOS.4.2	and adultery break out,
HOS.4.2	and bloodshed follows bloodshed. 
HOS.4.3	Therefore the land mourns, 
HOS.4.3	and all those living in it languish 
HOS.4.3	with the animals of the field, 
HOS.4.3	and the birds of the heaven, 
HOS.4.3	and even the fish of the sea 
HOS.4.3	are being swept away. 
HOS.4.4	Yet, let no one contend, 
HOS.4.4	and let no one accuse, 
HOS.4.4	for with you, O priest, is my contention.
HOS.4.5	You will stumble by day, 
HOS.4.5	and the priest also will stumble 
HOS.4.5	with you at night. 
HOS.4.5	And I will destroy your mother; 
HOS.4.6	My people are destroyed 
HOS.4.6	for lack of knowledge; 
HOS.4.6	because you have rejected knowledge, 
HOS.4.6	I reject you from acting as a priest for me.
HOS.4.6	And since you have forgotten the law of your God, 
HOS.4.6	I will also forget your children.
HOS.4.7	When they became many, their sin increased against me; 
HOS.4.7	they changed
HOS.4.8	They feed on the sin of my people,
HOS.4.8	they are greedy
HOS.4.9	And it will be like people, like priest; 
HOS.4.9	I will punish them
HOS.4.9	and I will requite them
HOS.4.10	They will eat and not be satisfied; 
HOS.4.10	they will play the whore and not multiply, 
HOS.4.10	because they have forsaken Yahweh to devote themselves to 
HOS.4.11	whoredom.
HOS.4.11	Wine and new wine take away the understanding.
HOS.4.12	My people, 
HOS.4.12	consult their wooden idols,
HOS.4.12	and their divining rod gives them oracles; 
HOS.4.12	because a spirit of whoredom led them astray, 
HOS.4.12	and they played the whore from under their God.
HOS.4.13	On the tops of the mountains they sacrifice, 
HOS.4.13	and on the hills they make offerings, 
HOS.4.13	under oak, poplar, and terebinth, 
HOS.4.13	because their
HOS.4.13	Therefore your daughters play the whore, 
HOS.4.13	and all your daughters-in-law
HOS.4.14	I will not punish your daughters
HOS.4.14	or your daughters-in-law
HOS.4.14	because they go aside with whores, 
HOS.4.14	and they sacrifice with temple prostitutes, 
HOS.4.14	a people that does not understand comes to ruin. 
HOS.4.15	Even though you, O Israel, are playing the whore, 
HOS.4.15	do not let Judah become guilty; 
HOS.4.15	do not enter Gilgal, 
HOS.4.15	or go up to Beth-aven; 
HOS.4.15	and do not swear, 
HOS.4.15	“As Yahweh lives!”
HOS.4.16	Indeed, like a stubborn heifer, 
HOS.4.16	Israel is stubborn; 
HOS.4.16	Now Yahweh will feed them, 
HOS.4.16	like a lamb in broad pasture.
HOS.4.17	Ephraim is joined to idols; 
HOS.4.17	let him alone. 
HOS.4.18	When their drinking has ended, 
HOS.4.18	they surely indulge in sexual orgies. 
HOS.4.18	They love lewdness more than their
HOS.4.19	A wind has wrapped them
HOS.4.19	and they will be ashamed because of their altars. 
HOS.5.1	Hear this, O priests! 
HOS.5.1	Give heed, O house of Israel! 
HOS.5.1	Listen, O house of the king! 
HOS.5.1	Because the judgment applies to you; 
HOS.5.1	because you have been a snare for Mizpah, 
HOS.5.1	and a net spread out on Tabor; 
HOS.5.2	they dug a deep pit
HOS.5.2	but I am a punishment for all of them. 
HOS.5.3	I myself know Ephraim, 
HOS.5.3	and Israel is not hidden from me; 
HOS.5.3	because now you have played the whore, O Ephraim— 
HOS.5.3	Israel is defiled. 
HOS.5.4	Their deeds do not permit them 
HOS.5.4	to return them to God. 
HOS.5.4	Because a spirit of whoredom is in their midst, 
HOS.5.4	they do not know Yahweh. 
HOS.5.5	The pride of Israel testifies against him,
HOS.5.5	and Israel and Ephraim stumble in their guilt, 
HOS.5.5	and Judah stumbles with them. 
HOS.5.6	With their flocks
HOS.5.6	to seek Yahweh, but they will not find him; 
HOS.5.6	he has withdrawn from them. 
HOS.5.7	They have dealt faithlessly with Yahweh 
HOS.5.7	because they have borne illegitimate children. 
HOS.5.7	Now the new moon will devour them with their fields. 
HOS.5.8	Blow the horn
HOS.5.8	the trumpet in Ramah. 
HOS.5.8	Sound the alarm in Beth-aven; 
HOS.5.8	look behind you, Benjamin. 
HOS.5.9	Ephraim will be a desolation 
HOS.5.9	in the day of punishment; 
HOS.5.9	among the tribes of Israel 
HOS.5.9	I will reveal what is true. 
HOS.5.10	The princes of Judah have become 
HOS.5.10	like those who remove a landmark; 
HOS.5.10	on them I will pour out 
HOS.5.10	my wrath like water. 
HOS.5.11	Ephraim is oppressed, 
HOS.5.11	crushed in judgment, 
HOS.5.11	because he was determined 
HOS.5.11	to go after filth.
HOS.5.12	But I am like a maggot to Ephraim 
HOS.5.12	and like rottenness to the house of Judah. 
HOS.5.13	And when Ephraim saw his illness, 
HOS.5.13	and Judah his wound, 
HOS.5.13	Ephraim went to Assyria, 
HOS.5.13	he sent to the great king.
HOS.5.13	But he was unable to cure you 
HOS.5.13	and heal your wound. 
HOS.5.14	Because I will be like a lion to Ephraim 
HOS.5.14	and like a fierce strong lion to the house of Judah. 
HOS.5.14	I myself will tear and I will go; 
HOS.5.14	I will carry off, and there is no one who delivers. 
HOS.5.15	I will return again
HOS.5.15	until they acknowledge their guilt 
HOS.5.15	and seek my face; 
HOS.5.15	in their distress they will search
HOS.6.1	Come, let us return to Yahweh; 
HOS.6.1	because it is he who has torn, and he will heal us; 
HOS.6.1	he has struck us down and will bind us up. 
HOS.6.2	He will revive us after two days; 
HOS.6.2	on the third day he will raise us up, 
HOS.6.2	that we may live in his presence.
HOS.6.3	Let us know, let us press on to know Yahweh; 
HOS.6.3	his rising is sure like the dawn. 
HOS.6.3	He will come like the showers to us, 
HOS.6.3	like the spring rain that waters the earth. 
HOS.6.4	What will I do with you, O Ephraim? 
HOS.6.4	What will I do with you, O Judah? 
HOS.6.4	Your love is like a morning cloud, 
HOS.6.4	like the dew that goes away early in the morning. 
HOS.6.5	Therefore, I have hewn them by the prophets; 
HOS.6.5	I have killed them by the words of my mouth, 
HOS.6.5	and my judgment
HOS.6.6	Because I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, 
HOS.6.6	and knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings. 
HOS.6.7	But like Adam, they transgressed the covenant; 
HOS.6.7	there they dealt faithlessly with me. 
HOS.6.8	Gilead is a city of evil, 
HOS.6.8	a cunning city because of blood.
HOS.6.9	Like bandits lying in wait, 
HOS.6.9	so is a band of priests; 
HOS.6.9	they murder on the road to Shechem; 
HOS.6.9	indeed, they commit a monstrous crime. 
HOS.6.10	In the house of Israel I have seen something horrible; 
HOS.6.10	Ephraim’s unfaithfulness is there. 
HOS.6.10	Israel is defiled. 
HOS.6.11	For you also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed, 
HOS.6.11	when I restore the fortunes of my people, 
HOS.7.1	 when I would heal Israel, 
HOS.7.1	and the corruption of Ephraim is revealed, 
HOS.7.1	and the wicked deeds of Samaria; 
HOS.7.1	because they deal in falsehood, 
HOS.7.1	the thief breaks in,
HOS.7.1	and the bandit raids the outside. 
HOS.7.2	But they did not consider
HOS.7.2	that I remember all their wickedness. 
HOS.7.2	Now their deeds surround them; 
HOS.7.2	they are before my face. 
HOS.7.3	By their wickedness they make the king glad, 
HOS.7.3	and the officials by their treacheries. 
HOS.7.4	All of them commit adultery, 
HOS.7.4	like a burning oven 
HOS.7.4	whose baker has stopped from stirring the fire, 
HOS.7.4	and from kneading the dough until it is leavened. 
HOS.7.5	On the day of our king, the princes 
HOS.7.5	became sick with the heat of wine;
HOS.7.5	he stretched out his hand with mockers. 
HOS.7.6	Because they are kindled
HOS.7.6	their heart burns within them; 
HOS.7.6	all night their anger smolders,
HOS.7.6	in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire. 
HOS.7.7	All of them are hot as an oven, 
HOS.7.7	and they devour
HOS.7.7	All their kings have fallen; 
HOS.7.7	there is none who calls to me amongst them. 
HOS.7.8	Ephraim mixes himself 
HOS.7.8	with the nations; 
HOS.7.8	Ephraim is a bread cake 
HOS.7.8	not turned over. 
HOS.7.9	Foreigners devour
HOS.7.9	and he does not know it; 
HOS.7.9	mold
HOS.7.9	and he does not know it. 
HOS.7.10	The pride of Israel testifies against him
HOS.7.10	they do not return to Yahweh their God; 
HOS.7.10	they do not seek him for all of this.
HOS.7.11	Ephraim was like a dove, 
HOS.7.11	silly, without sense;
HOS.7.11	they call to Egypt, 
HOS.7.11	they go to Assyria. 
HOS.7.12	Just as they go, I will cast my net 
HOS.7.12	over them; 
HOS.7.12	I will bring them down 
HOS.7.12	like the birds
HOS.7.12	I will discipline them 
HOS.7.12	according to a report to their assembly.
HOS.7.13	Woe to them, because they have strayed from me! 
HOS.7.13	Destruction to them, because they have rebelled against me! 
HOS.7.13	I myself would redeem them, 
HOS.7.13	but they speak lies against me. 
HOS.7.14	They do not cry out to me from their heart, 
HOS.7.14	but they wail on their beds; 
HOS.7.14	because of grain and new wine they lacerate
HOS.7.14	they depart from me. 
HOS.7.15	And I myself trained 
HOS.7.15	and strengthened their arms; 
HOS.7.15	but they plan evil against me. 
HOS.7.16	They turn, not to the Most High,
HOS.7.16	like a slack bow; 
HOS.7.16	their officials will fall by the sword 
HOS.7.16	because of the anger of their tongue. 
HOS.7.16	This is their scorn
HOS.7.16	in the land of Egypt. 
HOS.8.1	Put to your lips the trumpet 
HOS.8.1	like a vulture over the house of Yahweh, 
HOS.8.1	because they have broken my covenant
HOS.8.1	and rebelled against my law. 
HOS.8.2	They cry out to me, 
HOS.8.2	“My God! We, Israel, know you!” 
HOS.8.3	Israel has spurned the good; 
HOS.8.3	the enemy will pursue him. 
HOS.8.4	They appointed kings, but not through me; 
HOS.8.4	they made officials, but without my knowledge. 
HOS.8.4	With their silver and gold 
HOS.8.4	they made idols for themselves 
HOS.8.4	for their
HOS.8.5	Your calf is rejected,
HOS.8.5	my anger burns against them. 
HOS.8.5	How long
HOS.8.6	Because it is from Israel, 
HOS.8.6	an artisan made it, 
HOS.8.6	it is not a god; 
HOS.8.6	for the calf of Samaria 
HOS.8.6	will be broken to pieces. 
HOS.8.7	Because they sow the wind, 
HOS.8.7	they will reap the whirlwind. 
HOS.8.7	The standing grain does not have heads;
HOS.8.7	it will not yield flour. 
HOS.8.7	And if it would yield, 
HOS.8.7	strangers would devour it. 
HOS.8.8	Israel is swallowed up; 
HOS.8.8	now they are among the nations, 
HOS.8.8	like an object that no one desires. 
HOS.8.9	For they have gone up to Assyria, 
HOS.8.9	a wild donkey alone to itself; 
HOS.8.9	Ephraim has sold itself for lovers. 
HOS.8.10	Even though they have sold themselves to the nations, 
HOS.8.10	now I will gather them. 
HOS.8.10	They will soon writhe 
HOS.8.10	from the burden of kings
HOS.8.11	When Ephraim multiplied altars 
HOS.8.11	to expiate sins, 
HOS.8.11	they became to him altars to sin on. 
HOS.8.12	I write for him myriads of my instruction;
HOS.8.12	they are regarded as a strange thing. 
HOS.8.13	They offer sacrifices of my choice
HOS.8.13	and they eat flesh; 
HOS.8.13	Yahweh does not accept them. 
HOS.8.13	Now he will remember their iniquity 
HOS.8.13	and punish their sins; 
HOS.8.13	they will return to Egypt. 
HOS.8.14	Israel has forgotten his maker and built palaces, 
HOS.8.14	and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; 
HOS.8.14	but I will send fire on his cities 
HOS.8.14	and it will devour her strongholds. 
HOS.9.1	Do not rejoice, O Israel, 
HOS.9.1	do not exult like the nations! 
HOS.9.1	For you played the whore, departing from your God; 
HOS.9.1	you loved a harlot’s wage 
HOS.9.1	on all the threshing floors of grain. 
HOS.9.2	Threshing floor and wine vat will not feed them, 
HOS.9.2	and new wine will fail her.
HOS.9.3	They will not remain 
HOS.9.3	in the land of Yahweh. 
HOS.9.3	But Ephraim will return to Egypt, 
HOS.9.3	and in Assyria they will eat unclean food. 
HOS.9.4	They will not pour drink offerings of wine to Yahweh, 
HOS.9.4	and their sacrifices will not please him. 
HOS.9.4	They are like mourners’ bread for them; 
HOS.9.4	all those who eat it will be defiled. 
HOS.9.4	For their bread will be for their hunger;
HOS.9.4	it will not come to the house of Yahweh. 
HOS.9.5	What will you do on the day of the appointed time, 
HOS.9.5	and on the day of the festival of Yahweh? 
HOS.9.6	For look! If they flee from the destruction, 
HOS.9.6	Egypt will gather them; 
HOS.9.6	Memphis
HOS.9.6	Nettles will possess 
HOS.9.6	their precious things of silver; 
HOS.9.6	thorns will be in their tents. 
HOS.9.7	The days of punishment have come; 
HOS.9.7	the days of retribution have come; 
HOS.9.7	Israel knows! 
HOS.9.7	The prophet is a fool, 
HOS.9.7	the man of the spirit is acting like a madman. 
HOS.9.7	Because of the greatness of your sin, 
HOS.9.7	your hostility is great. 
HOS.9.8	The prophet keeps watch over Ephraim for my God; 
HOS.9.8	the snare of a fowler is on all his ways, 
HOS.9.8	and hostility in the house of his God. 
HOS.9.9	They deeply corrupted themselves
HOS.9.9	as in the days of Gibeah; 
HOS.9.9	he will remember their sin, 
HOS.9.9	he will punish their sins. 
HOS.9.10	Like the grapes in the wilderness, 
HOS.9.10	I found Israel. 
HOS.9.10	Like early ripened fruit on the fig tree in the first season,
HOS.9.10	I saw your ancestors.
HOS.9.10	They themselves came to Baal Peor, 
HOS.9.10	and they consecrated themselves to shame. 
HOS.9.10	And they became detestable things, 
HOS.9.10	like the thing they love.
HOS.9.11	Ephraim’s glory is like a bird; 
HOS.9.11	it will fly away— 
HOS.9.11	no birth, no pregnancy, and no conception. 
HOS.9.12	Even though they bring up their children, 
HOS.9.12	I will bereave them before maturity.
HOS.9.12	Woe to them indeed, 
HOS.9.12	when I depart from them! 
HOS.9.13	Ephraim, as I see it, 
HOS.9.13	is like a palm in a meadow; 
HOS.9.13	but Ephraim must bring out 
HOS.9.13	his children to the slayer. 
HOS.9.14	Give them, O Yahweh— 
HOS.9.14	what will you give them? 
HOS.9.14	Give them a miscarrying womb 
HOS.9.14	and dry breasts. 
HOS.9.15	Every evil of theirs began at Gilgal, 
HOS.9.15	so I began to hate them there; 
HOS.9.15	because of the evil of their deeds 
HOS.9.15	I will drive them out from my house. 
HOS.9.15	I will love them no more; 
HOS.9.15	all their officials are rebels. 
HOS.9.16	Ephraim is stricken, 
HOS.9.16	their root is dried up, 
HOS.9.16	they shall not bear fruit. 
HOS.9.16	Even if they give birth, 
HOS.9.16	I will kill the cherished offspring of their womb. 
HOS.9.17	My God will reject them 
HOS.9.17	because they did not listen to him, 
HOS.9.17	and they will be wanderers among the nations. 
HOS.10.1	Israel is a luxuriant vine;
HOS.10.1	he yields fruit for himself. 
HOS.10.1	The more his fruit increased, 
HOS.10.1	the more he made numerous altars. 
HOS.10.1	The more his land prospered, 
HOS.10.1	the more he
HOS.10.2	Their heart is false; 
HOS.10.2	now they must bear their guilt. 
HOS.10.2	He himself
HOS.10.2	he will destroy their stone pillars. 
HOS.10.3	For now they will say, 
HOS.10.3	“We have no king; 
HOS.10.3	indeed, we did not fear Yahweh, 
HOS.10.3	and what can a king do for us?” 
HOS.10.4	They utter words of vain oaths 
HOS.10.4	when making covenants,
HOS.10.4	and judgment blossoms like a poisonous plant 
HOS.10.4	on the furrows of the field. 
HOS.10.5	The inhabitants
HOS.10.5	for the calf
HOS.10.5	Indeed, his people will mourn for it, 
HOS.10.5	and his idolatrous priests will wail
HOS.10.5	over its glory because it has departed from it. 
HOS.10.6	It will also be brought to Assyria, 
HOS.10.6	as tribute to the great king.
HOS.10.6	Ephraim will obtain disgrace 
HOS.10.6	and Israel will be ashamed from his advice.
HOS.10.7	Samaria will be destroyed; 
HOS.10.7	her king is like a chip on the surface of the water. 
HOS.10.8	The high places of Aven, 
HOS.10.8	the sin of Israel, will be destroyed. 
HOS.10.8	Thorn and thistle will grow 
HOS.10.8	on their altars. 
HOS.10.8	They will say to the mountains, “Cover us,” 
HOS.10.8	and to the hills, “Fall on us.” 
HOS.10.9	From the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel; 
HOS.10.9	there they have remained.
HOS.10.9	Will not war in Gibeah overtake them 
HOS.10.9	against the children of evil? 
HOS.10.10	In my desire
HOS.10.10	nations will be gathered against them 
HOS.10.10	when they are punished for their double iniquities.
HOS.10.11	Ephraim was a trained heifer, 
HOS.10.11	that loved to thresh grain, 
HOS.10.11	and I myself spared
HOS.10.11	the fairness of her neck; 
HOS.10.11	I will make Ephraim break the ground, 
HOS.10.11	Judah will plow, 
HOS.10.11	Jacob must till for himself. 
HOS.10.12	Sow for yourselves righteousness; 
HOS.10.12	reap loyal love.
HOS.10.12	Break up for yourself fallow ground; 
HOS.10.12	it is time to seek Yahweh 
HOS.10.12	so he will come and rain 
HOS.10.12	righteousness upon you. 
HOS.10.13	You have plowed wickedness, 
HOS.10.13	you have reaped injustice, 
HOS.10.13	you have eaten the fruit of lies,
HOS.10.13	because you have trusted in your strength, 
HOS.10.13	in the multitude of your warriors. 
HOS.10.14	The tumult of war will rise up against your people, 
HOS.10.14	and all your fortresses will be destroyed, 
HOS.10.14	as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel; 
HOS.10.14	on the day of war 
HOS.10.14	mothers were dashed to pieces with their children.
HOS.10.15	So it will be done to you, O Bethel, 
HOS.10.15	because of the evil of your wickedness; 
HOS.10.15	at dawn, the king of Israel 
HOS.10.15	will be utterly destroyed. 
HOS.11.1	When Israel was a child, I loved him, 
HOS.11.1	and out of Egypt I called my son. 
HOS.11.2	When I called
HOS.11.2	They sacrificed to the Baals, and they sacrificed to idols. 
HOS.11.3	And I myself taught Ephraim to walk; 
HOS.11.3	I took them
HOS.11.3	but they did not know that I healed them. 
HOS.11.4	I drew them with human ties,
HOS.11.4	with the bands of love. 
HOS.11.4	I was to them like one who lifted up
HOS.11.4	though I bent down to them
HOS.11.5	He will return
HOS.11.5	and Assyria will be his king,
HOS.11.5	because they refused to return. 
HOS.11.6	The sword rages in his cities; 
HOS.11.6	it consumes his false prophets 
HOS.11.6	and devours because of their plans. 
HOS.11.7	My people are bent on backsliding from me. 
HOS.11.7	To the Most High they call, 
HOS.11.7	he does not raise them at all. 
HOS.11.8	How can I give you up, O Ephraim? 
HOS.11.8	How can I hand you over, O Israel? 
HOS.11.8	How can I make you like Admah? 
HOS.11.8	How can I treat you like Zeboiim? 
HOS.11.8	My heart is disturbed
HOS.11.8	all
HOS.11.9	I will not execute
HOS.11.9	I will not again destroy Ephraim; 
HOS.11.9	because I am God 
HOS.11.9	and not a mortal,
HOS.11.9	the Holy One in your midst; 
HOS.11.9	and I will not come in wrath. 
HOS.11.10	They will go after Yahweh; 
HOS.11.10	he roars like a lion. 
HOS.11.10	When he roars, 
HOS.11.10	his children will come trembling 
HOS.11.10	from the sea.
HOS.11.11	They will tremble like birds
HOS.11.11	and like doves
HOS.11.11	and I will let them return
HOS.11.11	a declaration of Yahweh. 
HOS.11.12	 Ephraim has surrounded me with lies,
HOS.11.12	and the house of Israel with deceit; 
HOS.11.12	and Judah is still wandering with God 
HOS.11.12	and is faithful to the Holy One. 
HOS.12.1	 Ephraim herds the wind
HOS.12.1	and is pursuing the east wind all day long; 
HOS.12.1	he multiplies deception and violence 
HOS.12.1	and he
HOS.12.1	and oil is brought to Egypt. 
HOS.12.2	Yahweh has a quarrel
HOS.12.2	and will punish Jacob according to his ways 
HOS.12.2	and repay him according to his deeds. 
HOS.12.3	In the womb he deceived his brother, 
HOS.12.3	and in his manhood he struggled with God. 
HOS.12.4	He struggled with the angel and prevailed; 
HOS.12.4	he pleaded for his mercy. 
HOS.12.4	He met him at Bethel, 
HOS.12.4	and there he spoke with him.
HOS.12.5	Yahweh the God of hosts, 
HOS.12.5	Yahweh is his renowned name! 
HOS.12.6	But you, you must return to your God; 
HOS.12.6	keep love and justice, 
HOS.12.6	and wait continually for your God. 
HOS.12.7	The trader, in his hand are scales of deceit;
HOS.12.7	he loves to oppress. 
HOS.12.8	And Ephraim said, “Surely, I am rich, 
HOS.12.8	I gained
HOS.12.8	in all my toil they have not found guilt in me 
HOS.12.8	that is sin. 
HOS.12.9	But I am Yahweh your God 
HOS.12.9	since
HOS.12.9	I will make you live in tents again, 
HOS.12.9	like the days of the appointed festival. 
HOS.12.10	I spoke to the prophets; 
HOS.12.10	I myself multiplied revelations
HOS.12.10	and through the hand of the prophets I will destroy. 
HOS.12.11	If in Gilead there is evil, 
HOS.12.11	surely they will come to nothing. 
HOS.12.11	In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls, 
HOS.12.11	also their altars will be like stone heaps 
HOS.12.11	on furrows of the field. 
HOS.12.12	Jacob fled to the open field of Aram,
HOS.12.12	and Israel served for a wife, 
HOS.12.12	and for a wife he watched over sheep. 
HOS.12.13	And by a prophet Yahweh brought 
HOS.12.13	Israel up from Egypt, 
HOS.12.13	and by a prophet 
HOS.12.13	he
HOS.12.14	Ephraim has caused bitter provocation, 
HOS.12.14	and his Lord will hold him responsible for his crimes
HOS.12.14	and pay back to him his insults. 
HOS.13.1	When Ephraim spoke,
HOS.13.1	he was exalted in Israel, 
HOS.13.1	but he incurred guilt through Baal and died. 
HOS.13.2	And now they sin again, 
HOS.13.2	and they make for themselves a molten idol, 
HOS.13.2	idols from their silver metal according to their understanding, 
HOS.13.2	all of them the work of skilled craftsmen. 
HOS.13.2	To these they say, “Sacrifice!” 
HOS.13.2	People are kissing bull calves. 
HOS.13.3	Therefore, they will be like the morning cloud, 
HOS.13.3	and like the dew of early morning going away, 
HOS.13.3	like chaff swirling from the threshing floor, 
HOS.13.3	or like smoke from a window. 
HOS.13.4	I am Yahweh your God 
HOS.13.4	since
HOS.13.4	you know no god except me, 
HOS.13.4	and no one saves besides me. 
HOS.13.5	I fed you
HOS.13.5	in the land of drought. 
HOS.13.6	When I fed them,
HOS.13.6	they were satisfied and their heart was lifted up; 
HOS.13.6	therefore they forgot me. 
HOS.13.7	And I will be like a lion to them; 
HOS.13.7	I lie in wait beside the way, like a leopard. 
HOS.13.8	I will attack them like a bear robbed of her offspring, 
HOS.13.8	and I will tear open the covering of their heart; 
HOS.13.8	there I will devour them like a lion, 
HOS.13.8	like an animal of the field would mutilate them. 
HOS.13.9	I will destroy you,
HOS.13.9	who will help you?
HOS.13.10	Where now is your king that he may save you? 
HOS.13.10	Where in all your cities are your judges, 
HOS.13.10	of whom you said, “Give to 
HOS.13.10	me a king and rulers?” 
HOS.13.11	I gave you a king in my anger, 
HOS.13.11	and I took him in my wrath. 
HOS.13.12	The sin of Ephraim is wrapped up; 
HOS.13.12	his sin is concealed. 
HOS.13.13	The labor pains of childbirth come for him; 
HOS.13.13	he is an unwise son 
HOS.13.13	because at the proper time, he does not present himself 
HOS.13.13	at the mouth of the womb.
HOS.13.14	Should I redeem them from the power
HOS.13.14	Should I deliver them from death? 
HOS.13.14	Where are your plagues, O Death? 
HOS.13.14	Where is your destruction, O Sheol?
HOS.13.14	Compassion is hidden from my eyes. 
HOS.13.15	Although he may flourish among reeds,
HOS.13.15	the east wind will come, a wind of Yahweh 
HOS.13.15	rising from the desert; 
HOS.13.15	his fountain will dry up, 
HOS.13.15	his spring will be parched. 
HOS.13.15	It will plunder his treasury,
HOS.13.15	every object of desire. 
HOS.13.16	 Samaria will be guilty, 
HOS.13.16	because she has rebelled against her God; 
HOS.13.16	they will fall by the sword, 
HOS.13.16	their children will be dashed to pieces, 
HOS.13.16	and their pregnant women will be ripped open. 
HOS.14.1	Return to Yahweh your God, O Israel, 
HOS.14.1	for you have stumbled because of your sin. 
HOS.14.2	Take words with you, 
HOS.14.2	and return to Yahweh. 
HOS.14.2	Say to him, 
HOS.14.2	“Take away all guilt; 
HOS.14.2	accept good, and we will offer 
HOS.14.2	the fruit
HOS.14.3	Assyria will not save us; 
HOS.14.3	we will not ride on horses,
HOS.14.3	and we will say no more, “Our God,” 
HOS.14.3	to the work of our hands 
HOS.14.3	because in you the fatherless child finds mercy. 
HOS.14.4	I will heal their disloyalty;
HOS.14.4	I will love them freely 
HOS.14.4	because my anger has turned back 
HOS.14.4	from them.
HOS.14.5	I will be like the dew to Israel; 
HOS.14.5	he will blossom like the lily plant, 
HOS.14.5	and he will strike his roots like the trees of Lebanon. 
HOS.14.6	His new plant shoots will spread out; 
HOS.14.6	his splendor will be like the olive tree, 
HOS.14.6	and his scent like the trees of Lebanon. 
HOS.14.7	They will again dwell
HOS.14.7	they will grow grain 
HOS.14.7	and they will blossom like the plant vine; 
HOS.14.7	his fame will be like the wine of Lebanon. 
HOS.14.8	O Ephraim, what have I to do
HOS.14.8	I myself have answered and looked after you.
HOS.14.8	I am like a luxuriant cypress; 
HOS.14.8	your fruit
HOS.14.9	Who is wise that he can understand these things? 
HOS.14.9	Who is discerning that he knows them? 
HOS.14.9	The ways of Yahweh are right, 
HOS.14.9	and the righteous walk in them; 
HOS.14.9	but transgressors stumble in them. 
JOL.1.1	 The word of Yahweh that came to Joel son of Pethuel. 
JOL.1.2	Hear this, O elders, 
JOL.1.2	and give ear, all the inhabitants of the land. 
JOL.1.2	Has this happened in your days? 
JOL.1.2	Or the days of your ancestors? 
JOL.1.3	Tell it to your children, 
JOL.1.3	and your children to their children, 
JOL.1.3	and their children to the following generation. 
JOL.1.4	What the cutting locust left, 
JOL.1.4	the swarming locust has eaten. 
JOL.1.4	What the swarming locust left, 
JOL.1.4	the hopping locust has eaten. 
JOL.1.4	And what the hopping locust left, 
JOL.1.4	the destroying locust has eaten. 
JOL.1.5	Wake up, drunkards, and weep! 
JOL.1.5	Wail, all drinkers of wine, over the new wine, 
JOL.1.5	for it is cut off from your mouth. 
JOL.1.6	Because a nation has invaded
JOL.1.6	strong and beyond counting.
JOL.1.6	Its teeth are the teeth of a lion, 
JOL.1.6	and its fangs are those of a lioness. 
JOL.1.7	It has made my vine a desolation, 
JOL.1.7	and my fig tree a completely splintered stump. 
JOL.1.7	It has stripped them bare and thrown them down; 
JOL.1.7	their branches have turned white. 
JOL.1.8	Lament like a virgin girded in sackcloth 
JOL.1.8	for the husband of her youth. 
JOL.1.9	The offering and libation are withheld 
JOL.1.9	from the house
JOL.1.9	The priests mourn, 
JOL.1.9	the ministers of Yahweh. 
JOL.1.10	The field is destroyed; 
JOL.1.10	the earth mourns 
JOL.1.10	because the grain is destroyed, 
JOL.1.10	the new wine dries up, 
JOL.1.10	the olive oil languishes. 
JOL.1.11	Be ashamed, farmers; 
JOL.1.11	Wail, vinedressers, 
JOL.1.11	over the wheat and over the barley, 
JOL.1.11	because the harvest of the field is ruined. 
JOL.1.12	The vine withers 
JOL.1.12	and the fig tree droops. 
JOL.1.12	The pomegranate tree, and also the palm tree, the apple tree 
JOL.1.12	—all the trees of the field—are dried up. 
JOL.1.12	Indeed, joy is dried up 
JOL.1.12	among the sons of men. 
JOL.1.13	Gird yourselves and lament, O priests! 
JOL.1.13	Wail, O ministers of the altar! 
JOL.1.13	Come spend the night in sackcloth, 
JOL.1.13	O ministers of my God, 
JOL.1.13	because offering and libation 
JOL.1.13	are withheld from the house of your God. 
JOL.1.14	Solemnize a fast! 
JOL.1.14	Call an assembly! 
JOL.1.14	Gather the elders, 
JOL.1.14	all of the inhabitants of the land 
JOL.1.14	in the house of Yahweh your God, 
JOL.1.14	and cry out to Yahweh. 
JOL.1.15	Ah! For the day! 
JOL.1.15	For the day of Yahweh is near. 
JOL.1.15	It will come like destruction from Shaddai.
JOL.1.16	Is not food cut off 
JOL.1.16	before our eyes, 
JOL.1.16	from the house of our God, 
JOL.1.16	joy and gladness? 
JOL.1.17	The seeds shrivel under their clods; 
JOL.1.17	the storehouses are desolate. 
JOL.1.17	The grain storage places are destroyed 
JOL.1.17	because grain has dried out. 
JOL.1.18	How the beasts
JOL.1.18	the herds of cattle wander around 
JOL.1.18	because there is no pasture for them; 
JOL.1.18	the flocks of sheep are in distress. 
JOL.1.19	To you, O Yahweh, I cry out, 
JOL.1.19	because fire has devoured 
JOL.1.19	the pastures of the desert, 
JOL.1.19	and flames
JOL.1.19	all the trees of the field. 
JOL.1.20	Also, the beasts of the field 
JOL.1.20	long for you, 
JOL.1.20	because the courses of water 
JOL.1.20	are dried up, 
JOL.1.20	and fire has devoured 
JOL.1.20	the pastures of the desert. 
JOL.2.1	Blow the trumpet
JOL.2.1	and sound the alarm on my holy mountain!
JOL.2.1	Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, 
JOL.2.1	for the day of Yahweh is coming 
JOL.2.1	—it is indeed near. 
JOL.2.2	A day of darkness and gloom, 
JOL.2.2	a day of cloud and thick darkness, 
JOL.2.2	like the dawn spreads on the mountains, 
JOL.2.2	a great and strong army! 
JOL.2.2	There has been nothing like it from old, 
JOL.2.2	and after it nothing will be again for generations to come.
JOL.2.3	Before them
JOL.2.3	and behind them a flame burns. 
JOL.2.3	Like the garden of Eden is the land before them,
JOL.2.3	and after them it is like a desolate desert, 
JOL.2.3	and nothing can escape them. 
JOL.2.4	Like the appearance of horses is their appearance, 
JOL.2.4	and like horsemen they run; 
JOL.2.5	like the sound of chariots on the tops of the mountains, they leap about; 
JOL.2.5	like the sound of a flame of fire 
JOL.2.5	devouring stubble; 
JOL.2.5	like a strong army arranged 
JOL.2.5	in rows for battle. 
JOL.2.6	From before them
JOL.2.6	all faces turn pale.
JOL.2.7	They run like mighty warriors,
JOL.2.7	they scale the wall like men of war; 
JOL.2.7	each goes on its own way, 
JOL.2.7	and they do not swerve from their paths. 
JOL.2.8	They do not jostle one another;
JOL.2.8	each goes on its own trail; 
JOL.2.8	and through the falling weapons,
JOL.2.8	they are not halted. 
JOL.2.9	In the city they rush forth; 
JOL.2.9	on the walls
JOL.2.9	Into the houses they climb up; 
JOL.2.9	through the windows 
JOL.2.9	they enter like a thief. 
JOL.2.10	Before them
JOL.2.10	the heavens tremble; 
JOL.2.10	the sun and the moon grow dark, 
JOL.2.10	and the stars have withheld
JOL.2.11	And Yahweh utters
JOL.2.11	because his encampment is very large; 
JOL.2.11	strong is the one who carries out his decree, 
JOL.2.11	for great is the day of Yahweh 
JOL.2.11	and exceedingly fearful. 
JOL.2.11	Who can endure it? 
JOL.2.12	“And even now,” declares
JOL.2.12	“return to me with all your heart, 
JOL.2.12	with fasting, and weeping, and wailing.” 
JOL.2.13	Rend your hearts
JOL.2.13	and return to Yahweh your God, 
JOL.2.13	because he is gracious and compassionate, 
JOL.2.13	slow to anger
JOL.2.13	and relenting from harm. 
JOL.2.14	Who knows whether he will turn and relent, 
JOL.2.14	and leave a blessing behind him, 
JOL.2.14	an offering and a libation, 
JOL.2.14	for Yahweh your God? 
JOL.2.15	Blow the trumpet
JOL.2.15	sanctify a fast, call an assembly; 
JOL.2.16	gather the people, consecrate the assembly; 
JOL.2.16	assemble the elders, gather the children, 
JOL.2.16	even those who are breast-feeding; 
JOL.2.16	let the bridegroom come out from his private room, 
JOL.2.16	and the bride from her canopy. 
JOL.2.17	Between the colonnade and the altar, 
JOL.2.17	let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep. 
JOL.2.17	And let them say, “Take pity, Yahweh, on your people. 
JOL.2.17	Do not make your inheritance a reproach, 
JOL.2.17	a byword among the nations. 
JOL.2.17	Why should they say among the nations, 
JOL.2.17	‘Where is their God?’ ” 
JOL.2.18	Then Yahweh became jealous for his land 
JOL.2.18	and took pity on his people. 
JOL.2.19	And Yahweh answered and said to his people, 
JOL.2.19	“Look at me, I am sending to you 
JOL.2.19	grain, new wine, and olive oil, 
JOL.2.19	and you will be satisfied by it. 
JOL.2.19	I will not give you over any more 
JOL.2.19	as a disgrace among the nations. 
JOL.2.20	The northerners
JOL.2.20	I will remove from you; 
JOL.2.20	I will drive them to a desert 
JOL.2.20	and desolate land, 
JOL.2.20	its
JOL.2.20	and its rear into the western sea; 
JOL.2.20	its stench and odor will rise up 
JOL.2.20	because he
JOL.2.21	Do not fear, O land, 
JOL.2.21	rejoice and be glad, 
JOL.2.21	because Yahweh has done great things. 
JOL.2.22	Do not fear, wild animals of the field, 
JOL.2.22	because the pastures of the desert have put forth new green shoots, 
JOL.2.22	because the tree has produced its fruit, 
JOL.2.22	the fig tree and the vine 
JOL.2.22	have yielded their produce. 
JOL.2.23	Be glad, O children of Zion, 
JOL.2.23	be glad and rejoice in Yahweh your God, 
JOL.2.23	because he has given for you 
JOL.2.23	the autumn rains for your righteousness,
JOL.2.23	and he has poured down
JOL.2.23	the autumn and spring rains, as before. 
JOL.2.24	The threshing floors will be full with grain, 
JOL.2.24	and the vats will overflow 
JOL.2.24	with new wine and olive oil. 
JOL.2.25	I will repay you the years 
JOL.2.25	that the locust has eaten, 
JOL.2.25	the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, 
JOL.2.25	my mighty troops that I sent against you. 
JOL.2.26	And you will eat abundantly and be satisfied, 
JOL.2.26	and praise the name of Yahweh your God, 
JOL.2.26	who has dealt with you wondrously.
JOL.2.26	My people will never be ashamed.
JOL.2.27	And you will know that I am in the midst of Israel, 
JOL.2.27	and I am Yahweh, 
JOL.2.27	your God, and there is no other. 
JOL.2.27	My people will never be ashamed again.
JOL.2.28	 And it will happen afterward thus: 
JOL.2.28	I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, 
JOL.2.28	and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, 
JOL.2.28	and your elders will dream dreams; 
JOL.2.28	your young men shall see visions. 
JOL.2.29	And also on the male slaves and on the female slaves, 
JOL.2.29	I will pour out my Spirit in those days. 
JOL.2.30	And I will set
JOL.2.31	The sun will be changed to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the coming of the great and awesome day of Yahweh. 
JOL.2.32	And it will happen—everyone who calls on the name of Yahweh will be rescued, because on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape,
JOL.3.1	 For look! In those days, and in that time, when I will return
JOL.3.2	I will gather all the nations, and I will bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat, and I will argue a case against them
JOL.3.3	For my people they cast lots,
JOL.3.4	What are you to me, O Tyre and O Sidon, and all of the regions of Philistia? Are you repaying to me what is deserved? If you are recompensing me, I will return swiftly and quickly what you deserve on your head! 
JOL.3.5	For you have taken my silver and my gold, and my beautiful treasures you have carried into your temples. 
JOL.3.6	And the sons of Judah and Jerusalem you sold to the sons of the Greeks, in order to remove them from their border. 
JOL.3.7	Look! I am rousing them from the place where you have sold them, and I will return what you deserve on your head! 
JOL.3.8	I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans and to a nation far away, for Yahweh has spoken. 
JOL.3.9	Proclaim this among the nations: 
JOL.3.9	Prepare for war!
JOL.3.9	Stir up the mighty warriors; 
JOL.3.9	let them approach and come up; 
JOL.3.9	let all the men of war approach. 
JOL.3.10	Beat your cutting tools of iron into swords 
JOL.3.10	and your pruning hooks into spears; 
JOL.3.10	let the weakling say, ‘I am a mighty warrior!’ 
JOL.3.11	Hurry and come, 
JOL.3.11	all the nations, from all around, 
JOL.3.11	and gather yourselves there. 
JOL.3.11	Bring down your mighty warriors, O Yahweh! 
JOL.3.12	Let the nations be roused and let them come up 
JOL.3.12	to the valley of Jehoshaphat, 
JOL.3.12	for there I will sit to judge 
JOL.3.12	all the nations from all around. 
JOL.3.13	Send forth the sickle, 
JOL.3.13	for the harvest is ripe! 
JOL.3.13	Go tread, 
JOL.3.13	for the winepress is full! 
JOL.3.13	The vats overflow, 
JOL.3.13	because their evil is great! 
JOL.3.14	Commotion, commotion 
JOL.3.14	in the valley of decision! 
JOL.3.14	For the day of Yahweh is near 
JOL.3.14	in the valley of decision! 
JOL.3.15	The sun and the moon grow dark, 
JOL.3.15	and the stars have withheld
JOL.3.16	And Yahweh roars from Zion; 
JOL.3.16	from Jerusalem he utters his voice, 
JOL.3.16	and the heavens and the earth shake. 
JOL.3.16	But Yahweh is a refuge for his people, 
JOL.3.16	and a protection for the children of Israel. 
JOL.3.17	And you will know that I, Yahweh your God, 
JOL.3.17	am dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain. 
JOL.3.17	And Jerusalem will be a place of holiness, 
JOL.3.17	and strangers will pass through it no longer. 
JOL.3.18	And it will happen on that day; 
JOL.3.18	the mountains will drip new wine, 
JOL.3.18	and the hills will flow with milk, 
JOL.3.18	and all the channels of Judah will flow with water. 
JOL.3.18	A spring from the house of Yahweh will come forth, 
JOL.3.18	and it will water the valley of Acacia Trees.
JOL.3.19	Egypt will become a desolation, 
JOL.3.19	and Edom will become a desolate desert,
JOL.3.19	because of the violence they did against the children of Judah, 
JOL.3.19	in whose land they have shed innocent blood. 
JOL.3.20	But Judah will be inhabited forever, 
JOL.3.20	and Jerusalem for all generations.
JOL.3.21	I will cleanse their bloodguilt
JOL.3.21	for Yahweh is dwelling in Zion. 
AMO.1.1	The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds from Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah the king of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Jehoash, two years before
AMO.1.2	And he said, “Yahweh roars from Zion and he utters his voice from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds wither and the top of Carmel dries up.” 
AMO.1.3	Thus says Yahweh, “For three transgressions of Damascus and for four I will not revoke the punishment,
AMO.1.4	So I will send fire against Hazael’s house and it will consume the citadel fortresses of Ben-Hadad. 
AMO.1.5	I will break the gate bars of Damascus and I will cut off the inhabitants from the Valley of Aven and the one who takes hold of the scepter of Beth Eden, and the people of Aram will go into exile to Kir,” says Yahweh. 
AMO.1.6	Thus says Yahweh: “For three transgressions of Gaza and for four I will not revoke the punishment,
AMO.1.7	So I will send a fire against the wall of Gaza and it will devour its citadel fortresses. 
AMO.1.8	And I will cut off the inhabitants from Ashdod and the one who takes hold of the scepter of Ashkelon. I will also turn my hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines will perish,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
AMO.1.9	Thus says Yahweh: “For three transgressions of Tyre and for four I will not revoke the punishment,
AMO.1.10	So I will send a fire against the wall of Tyre and it will devour its citadel fortresses.” 
AMO.1.11	Thus says Yahweh: “For three transgressions of Edom and for four I will not revoke the punishment,
AMO.1.12	So I will send a fire against Teman and it will devour the citadel fortresses of Bozrah.” 
AMO.1.13	Thus says Yahweh: “For three transgressions of Ammon and for four I will not revoke the punishment,
AMO.1.14	So I will kindle a fire against the wall of Rabbah and it will devour its citadel fortresses with a war cry on the day of battle, with a storm on the day of the violent tempest. 
AMO.1.15	And their king will go into exile, he and his commanders together,” says Yahweh. 
AMO.2.1	 Thus says Yahweh: “For three transgressions of Moab and for four I will not revoke the punishment,
AMO.2.2	So I will send a fire against Moab and it will devour the citadel fortresses of Kerioth, and Moab will die amid uproar, amid war cries and amid the sound of a horn. 
AMO.2.3	And I will cut off the ruler from its midst and I will kill all of its officials with him,” says Yahweh. 
AMO.2.4	Thus says Yahweh: “For three transgressions of Judah and for four I will not revoke the punishment,
AMO.2.5	So I will send a fire against Judah and it will devour the citadel fortresses of Jerusalem. 
AMO.2.6	Thus says Yahweh: “For three transgressions of Israel and for four I will not revoke the punishment,
AMO.2.7	Those who trample the heads of the powerless into the dust of the ground and turn aside the way of the destitute, a man and his father have sexual relations with
AMO.2.8	They stretch themselves out beside every altar on clothing taken in pledge and they drink wine, bought with fines imposed,
AMO.2.9	Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them,
AMO.2.10	And I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and I led you in the wilderness forty years to take possession of the land of the Amorite. 
AMO.2.11	And I raised up some of your sons to be prophets and some of your young men to be Nazirites. Is it not so, O people
AMO.2.12	But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets, saying, ‘You shall not prophesy.’ 
AMO.2.13	Look! I am going to press you down in your place just as a utility cart full of mature stalks of grain is pressed down. 
AMO.2.14	Flight will perish from the swift and the strong person will not muster his strength and the warrior will not save his life. 
AMO.2.15	And the one who takes hold of the bow will not stand and the one who is swift on his feet will not save himself, nor will the one who rides the horse save his life. 
AMO.2.16	Even those who are strong of heart among the mighty will flee away naked from the city on that day. This is the declaration of Yahweh!” 
AMO.3.1	Hear this word that Yahweh has spoken against you, O people of Israel, against the whole clan that I brought up from the land of Egypt:
AMO.3.2	“You only have I chosen
AMO.3.3	Do two walk together unless they have met? 
AMO.3.4	Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey?
AMO.3.5	Does a bird fall into a trapping net on the earth when there is no snare for it? Does a trapping net spring up from the ground unless it has certainly caught something? 
AMO.3.6	Or is a horn blown in a city and people are not afraid? Or does a disaster occur in the city and Yahweh has not done it? 
AMO.3.7	Surely my Lord does not do anything unless he has revealed his secret to his servants the prophets. 
AMO.3.8	A lion has roared! Who is not afraid? My Lord Yahweh has spoken, who will not prophesy? 
AMO.3.9	Proclaim to the citadel fortresses in Ashdod and the citadel fortresses in the land of Egypt and say: “Gather on the mountains of Samaria and see the great panic in her midst and the oppression in her midst!” 
AMO.3.10	“They do not know how to do right,” declares Yahweh,
AMO.3.11	Therefore, thus says my Lord Yahweh, “A foe shall surround the land and bring down your strongholds, and your citadel fortresses shall be plundered.” 
AMO.3.12	Thus says Yahweh, “Just as the shepherd rescues two legs or a piece of an ear from the mouth of the lion, so shall the people
AMO.3.13	“Listen and testify against the house of Jacob,” declares
AMO.3.14	“For on the day I punish Israel for its transgression,
AMO.3.15	I will ruin the winter house as well as the summer house, and the houses of ivory will perish and the great houses shall come to an end,” declares
AMO.4.1	Hear this word, you cows of Bashan who live on the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the powerless, who crush the poor, who say to their husbands, “Bring something so that we may drink!” 
AMO.4.2	My Lord Yahweh has sworn by his holiness that, “Behold, the days are coming upon you when they
AMO.4.3	And you shall leave through breaches in the wall, each one in front of her. You will be dragged off toward Harmon,”
AMO.4.4	“Come to Bethel and transgress; to Gilgal and multiply transgression!
AMO.4.5	And bring a thank offering of unleavened bread, and proclaim freewill offerings, pronounce them, for so you love to do, O people
AMO.4.6	“And I
AMO.4.7	“And I also withheld the rain from you when there were still three months to the harvest. And I would send rain on one city and send no rain on another city. One tract of land will be rained on, and the tract of land on which it does not rain
AMO.4.8	So two or three cities wandered to one city to drink water and they were not satisfied, yet you did not return to me,” is the declaration of Yahweh. 
AMO.4.9	“I struck you with blight and with mildew. Frequently the cutting locust devoured your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees, yet you did not return to me,” is the declaration of Yahweh. 
AMO.4.10	“I sent among you a plague in the manner of Egypt; I killed your young men with the sword, along with the captivity of your horses. And I made the stench of your camps go up into your nostrils, yet you did not return to me,” is the declaration of Yahweh. 
AMO.4.11	“I overthrew some of you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a stick snatched from the fire, and yet you did not return to me,” is the declaration of Yahweh. 
AMO.4.12	“Therefore, thus I will do to you, O Israel. Because I will do this to you, O Israel, prepare to meet your God! 
AMO.4.13	Yes, here is the one who forms the mountains, and the one who creates the wind, and the one who reveals to humans what his thoughts are, and the one who treads on the heights of the earth; Yahweh, the God of hosts, is his name!” 
AMO.5.1	Hear this word that I am going to intone over you as a lament, O house of Israel! 
AMO.5.2	Virgin Israel has fallen and will not rise again. She is deserted on her land; there is no one to raise her up. 
AMO.5.3	For thus says my Lord Yahweh, “The city that marches out with a thousand will only have a hundred left. And the one that marches out with a hundred will only have ten left for the house of Israel.” 
AMO.5.4	For thus says Yahweh to the house of Israel, “Seek me so that you may live.” 
AMO.5.5	But do not seek Bethel or go to Gilgal or cross over to Beersheba, for Gilgal will certainly go into exile and Bethel will come to disaster.” 
AMO.5.6	Seek Yahweh so that you may live, so that he will not break out like a fire against the house of Joseph! And it will devour, with none to quench
AMO.5.7	Ah, you who turn justice into wormwood and hurl righteousness to the ground! 
AMO.5.8	The one who made the Pleiades and Orion and who turns deep darkness into the morning and darkens day into night, the one who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the surface of the earth, Yahweh is his name! 
AMO.5.9	The one who makes destruction flash upon the fierce, so that
AMO.5.10	They hate the one who reproves in the gate and they abhor the one who speaks honestly. 
AMO.5.11	Therefore, because you trample on the poor and you take a grain tax from them, you built houses of dressed stone, but you will not live in them. You built vineyards of delightfulness, but you will not drink their wine. 
AMO.5.12	For I know your transgressions are many and your sins are numerous, you foes of the righteous, those who take a bribe, and those who
AMO.5.13	Therefore, whoever has insight will keep silent in that time, for it is a time of evil. 
AMO.5.14	Seek good and not bad in order that you may live, and so Yahweh, the God of hosts, will be with you, as you have said. 
AMO.5.15	Hate evil and love good and establish justice in the gate; perhaps Yahweh, the God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph. 
AMO.5.16	Therefore, thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, my Lord, “In all of the public squares there will be wailing, and in all of the streets they will say, ‘Alas, alas, alas!’ They shall call the farmers to mourning and to wailing, to those who are skilled in lamentation. 
AMO.5.17	And in all of the vineyards there will be wailing, because I will pass in your midst,” says Yahweh. 
AMO.5.18	Alas, those who desire the day of Yahweh, why is this for you the day of Yahweh? It will be darkness and not light! 
AMO.5.19	It will be as if a man fled from a lion and a bear met him; or he went into the house and leaned his hand against the wall and a snake bit him. 
AMO.5.20	Is not the day of Yahweh darkness and not light, and pitch dark with no brightness in it? 
AMO.5.21	“I hate, I despise your festivals, and I take no delight in your assemblies. 
AMO.5.22	Yes, even if you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them, and I will not look at the fellowship offerings of your fattened animals. 
AMO.5.23	Remove from me the noise of your songs, and I do not want to hear the melody of your harps! 
AMO.5.24	But let justice roll on like the water, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream. 
AMO.5.25	Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings those forty years in the desert, O house of Israel? 
AMO.5.26	And you will take up Sikkuth, your king, and Kaiwan, your images, the star of your gods which you made for yourselves. 
AMO.5.27	And I will deport you beyond Damascus,” says Yahweh—the God of hosts is his name. 
AMO.6.1	Alas for those being at ease in Zion, and those who feel secure on Mount Samaria, the notables of the best of the nations! The house of Israel resorts to them. 
AMO.6.2	Cross over to Calneh and see, and go from there to Hamath Rabbah and go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are you better than these kingdoms, or is their territory greater than your territory? 
AMO.6.3	You that put off the day of disaster and bring near a reign of violence! 
AMO.6.4	Alas for those who lie on beds of ivory and lounge on their couches, and those eating young rams from the sheep and goats, and bull-calves from the middle of the animal stall. 
AMO.6.5	Alas for those who sing to the tune of the harp; like David they improvise on instruments of music. 
AMO.6.6	Alas for those who drink from sprinkling bowls of wine and anoint themselves with the best of olive oils and are not grieved over the ruin of Joseph. 
AMO.6.7	Therefore, they shall now go into exile at the head of the exiles and the feast of lounging shall pass away. 
AMO.6.8	My Lord Yahweh has sworn by himself, declares
AMO.6.9	And then if ten people remain in one house, they too will die. 
AMO.6.10	And if one’s relative, who burns the body, lifts it up and brings the body out of the house and he will say to someone in the innermost part of the house, “Are there any more with you?” and he will say, “None,” then he will say, “Silence,” because we must not invoke the name of Yahweh. 
AMO.6.11	Look, Yahweh is going to command and the great house will be destroyed to bits and the little house to pieces. 
AMO.6.12	Do horses run on rocks, or does one plow the sea with oxen?
AMO.6.13	You who rejoice over Lo-Debar, who say, “Have we not taken Karnaim for ourselves by our strength?” 
AMO.6.14	Indeed, I am going to raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, declares
AMO.7.1	This is what my Lord Yahweh showed me, and look, he is going to form locusts at the beginning of the sprouting of the second crop, and look, after the mowings of the king. 
AMO.7.2	And then when they
AMO.7.3	Yahweh relented concerning this. “It will not be,” said Yahweh. 
AMO.7.4	This is what my Lord Yahweh showed me, and look, my Lord Yahweh was going to call for a legal case with fire, and it devoured the great deep and it ate up the plots of ground. 
AMO.7.5	Then I said, “O Lord Yahweh, please stop! How can Jacob stand, because he is small?” 
AMO.7.6	Yahweh also relented concerning this. “This also will not be,” said my Lord Yahweh. 
AMO.7.7	This is what he showed me: Behold, my Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plummet, and a plummet was in his hand. 
AMO.7.8	And Yahweh said to me, “What do you see?” And I said, “A plummet.” And my Lord said, “Look, I am going to set a plummet in the midst of my people, Israel. I will not pass them by again. 
AMO.7.9	The high places of Isaac shall become desolate and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste. And I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.” 
AMO.7.10	Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam the king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to endure all of his words. 
AMO.7.11	For this Amos has said, ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will certainly go into exile away from his land.’ ” 
AMO.7.12	And Amaziah said to Amos, “O seer, go, flee to the land of Judah and earn food there and prophesy there!” 
AMO.7.13	But do not prophesy again at Bethel, because this is a sanctuary of a king and this is a temple of a kingdom.” 
AMO.7.14	And Amos answered and said to Amaziah, “I am not a prophet and I am not a son of a prophet, but I am a herdsman and I am one taking care of sycamore trees. 
AMO.7.15	And Yahweh took me from following behind the sheep and goats and Yahweh said to me, “Go, prophesy to my people Israel! 
AMO.7.16	And so then, hear the word of Yahweh! You are saying, ‘You must not prophesy against Israel and you must not preach against the house of Isaac!’ 
AMO.7.17	Therefore, thus says Yahweh, ‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the city and your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword and your land will be divided with a line, and you
AMO.8.1	My Lord Yahweh showed me this, and there was a basket of summer fruit. 
AMO.8.2	And he said, “What do you see, Amos?” And I said, “A basket of summer fruit.” And Yahweh said to me, “The end has come upon my people Israel. I will not pass by them again!” 
AMO.8.3	“And the songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day,” declares
AMO.8.4	Hear this, those who trample on the poor and who annihilate the afflicted of the land, 
AMO.8.5	saying, “When will the new moon be over, so that we can sell grain? And the Sabbath, so that we can open the grain bins, that we can make the ephah small and make the shekel large, and can practice deceit with a set of scales of deceit? 
AMO.8.6	That we can
AMO.8.7	Yahweh has sworn by the pride of Jacob, “Surely I will never forget any of their deeds! 
AMO.8.8	On account of this, will not the land tremble and will not every living thing in it mourn? And all of it will rise like the Nile and it will be tossed about and subside like the Nile of Egypt. 
AMO.8.9	And then in that day,” declares
AMO.8.10	And I will turn your feasts into mourning and all of your songs into lament, and I will put sackcloth on all loins and baldness on every head. And I will make it like the mourning for an only child, and its end like a bitter day. 
AMO.8.11	Look, the days are coming,” declares
AMO.8.12	And they will wander from sea to sea and from the north and to the east. They will roam about to seek the word of Yahweh, but they will not find it! 
AMO.8.13	In that day the beautiful young women and the young men will faint because of thirst. 
AMO.8.14	These are those who swear by the guilt of Samaria and say, ‘By the life of your gods, O Dan,’ and ‘By the life of the way of Beersheba,’ they will fall and they will not rise again.” 
AMO.9.1	I saw my Lord standing by the altar and he said, “Strike the capitals so that the thresholds will shake, and shatter them on the head of all of them, and I will kill the rest of them with the sword. A fugitive belonging to them will not run away, and a survivor belonging to them will not escape. 
AMO.9.2	If they dig into Sheol, from there my hand will take them, and even if they climb up to heaven, from there I will bring them down. 
AMO.9.3	And even if they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, from there I will search and will take them, and even if they hide from before my eyes at the bottom of the sea, from there I will command the sea serpent and it will bite them. 
AMO.9.4	And even if they go into captivity before their enemies, from there I will command the sword and it will kill them, and I will fix my eyes on them for harm and not for good.” 
AMO.9.5	And thus will do the Lord Yahweh of hosts, who touches the earth and it melts, and all of those living in it mourn, and all of it rises like the Nile and it sinks down like the Nile of Egypt, 
AMO.9.6	who builds his upper chambers in the heavens and lays the foundation of his vault on the earth, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them on the surface of the earth—Yahweh is his name. 
AMO.9.7	“Are you not like the Cushites to me, O people of Israel?” declares
AMO.9.8	Look, the eyes of my Lord Yahweh are on the kingdom of sin, and I will destroy it from the surface of the earth. However, I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” declares
AMO.9.9	“Yes, look, I am going to command and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations like one who shakes with a sieve, but not a pebble will fall to the ground. 
AMO.9.10	All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, ‘Evil will not overtake or confront us.’ 
AMO.9.11	On that day I will raise up the booth of David that is fallen, and I will repair its breaches and will raise up its ruins and will build it like the days of old. 
AMO.9.12	Thus they may take possession of the remnant of Edom and all the nations who are called by my name,”
AMO.9.13	“Look, days are coming,” declares
AMO.9.14	And I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel, and they will rebuild the desolated cities and will inhabit them. And they will plant vineyards and will drink their wine, and they will make gardens and will eat their fruit. 
AMO.9.15	And I will plant them on their land and they will not be uprooted again from their land that I have given to them,” says Yahweh your God. 
OBA.1.1	The vision of Obadiah. Thus says my Lord Yahweh concerning Edom: 
OBA.1.1	We have heard a report from Yahweh, and a messenger has been sent among the nations: “Rise up and let us rise against it
OBA.1.2	“Look, I will
OBA.1.3	The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of a rock, the heights of its dwelling, you who say in your heart: ‘Who can bring me down to the ground?’ 
OBA.1.4	Even if you soar like the eagle, even if your nest is set among the stars, from there I will bring you down!” declares
OBA.1.5	“If thieves came to you, if plunderers of the night—How you have been destroyed!—would they not steal what they wanted?
OBA.1.6	How Esau has been pillaged; his treasures have been ransacked! 
OBA.1.7	All of your allies
OBA.1.8	On that day,” declares
OBA.1.9	And your warriors will be shattered, O Teman, so that everyone
OBA.1.10	“Because of the violence done to your brother Jacob, shame will cover you and you will be cut off forever. 
OBA.1.11	On the day you stood nearby,
OBA.1.12	But you should not have gloated
OBA.1.13	You should not have entered the gate of my people on the day of their disaster. You also should not have gloated over his misery on the day of his disaster, and you should not have stretched out your hands on the day of his disaster. 
OBA.1.14	And you should not have stood at the crossroads to cut off his fugitives and you should not have handed over his survivors on the day of distress. 
OBA.1.15	“For the day of Yahweh is near against all the nations! Just as you have done, it will be done to you. Your deeds will return on your own head. 
OBA.1.16	For just as you have drunk on my holy mountain,
OBA.1.17	But on Mount Zion there will be an escape, and it will be holy, and the house of Jacob will take possession of their dispossessors. 
OBA.1.18	And the house of Jacob will be a fire and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau stubble; and they will set them on fire and will consume them. And there will not be a survivor for the house of Esau,” for Yahweh has spoken. 
OBA.1.19	Those of the Negev will take possession of the mountain of Esau, and those of the Shephelah will possess the land of the Philistines, and they shall take possession of the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria, and Benjamin will take possession of Gilead. 
OBA.1.20	And the exiles
OBA.1.21	And those who have been saved will go up on Mount Zion to rule the mountain of Esau. And the kingdom will belong to
JON.1.1	And the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, 
JON.1.2	“Get up! Go to the great city Nineveh and cry out against her, because their evil has come up before me.”
JON.1.3	But Jonah set out to flee toward Tarshish from the presence of
JON.1.4	And Yahweh hurled a great wind upon the sea, and it was a great storm on the sea, and the merchant ship was in danger of breaking up.
JON.1.5	And the mariners were afraid, and each cried out to his god. And they threw the contents
JON.1.6	And the captain
JON.1.7	And they said to one another,
JON.1.8	So they said to him, “Please tell us whoever is responsible that this disaster has come upon us! What is your occupation? And from where do you come? What is your country? And from which people are you?” 
JON.1.9	And he said to them, “I am a Hebrew, and I fear Yahweh, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.” 
JON.1.10	Then the men were greatly afraid,
JON.1.11	So they said to him, “What shall we do to you so that the sea may quiet down for us?” because the sea was growing more and more tempestuous.
JON.1.12	And he said to them, “Pick me up and hurl me into the sea so that the sea may quiet down for you, because I know that on account of me this great storm has come upon you all.” 
JON.1.13	But the men rowed hard to bring the ship
JON.1.14	So they cried out to Yahweh, and they said, “O Yahweh! Please do not let us perish because of this man’s life, and do not make us guilty of innocent blood,
JON.1.15	And they picked Jonah up and hurled him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging. 
JON.1.16	So the men feared Yahweh greatly,
JON.1.17	 And Yahweh provided a large fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. 
JON.2.1	 And Jonah prayed to Yahweh his God from the belly of the fish 
JON.2.2	and said, 
JON.2.2	“I called from my distress
JON.2.2	and he answered me; 
JON.2.2	from the belly of Sheol
JON.2.2	you heard my voice. 
JON.2.3	And you threw me into the deep, 
JON.2.3	into the heart of the seas, 
JON.2.3	and the sea currents surrounded me; 
JON.2.3	all your breakers and your surging waves 
JON.2.3	passed over me. 
JON.2.4	And I said, ‘I am banished
JON.2.4	from your sight; 
JON.2.4	how
JON.2.4	on your holy temple?’
JON.2.5	The waters encompassed me up to my neck; 
JON.2.5	the deep surrounded me; 
JON.2.5	seaweed was wrapped around my head. 
JON.2.6	I went down to the foundations of the mountains; 
JON.2.6	the Underworld—its bars were around me forever. 
JON.2.6	But you brought up my life from the pit, 
JON.2.6	Yahweh my God. 
JON.2.7	When my life was ebbing away from me, 
JON.2.7	I remembered Yahweh, 
JON.2.7	and my prayer came to you, 
JON.2.7	to your holy temple.
JON.2.8	Those who worship vain idols 
JON.2.8	forsake their loyal love.
JON.2.9	But I, with a voice of thanksgiving, 
JON.2.9	will sacrifice to you; 
JON.2.9	I will fulfill what I have vowed. 
JON.2.9	Deliverance
JON.2.10	And Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out on the dry land. 
JON.3.1	And the word of Yahweh came to Jonah a second time, saying, 
JON.3.2	“Get up! Go to Nineveh, the great city, and proclaim to it the message that I am telling you.” 
JON.3.3	So Jonah got up
JON.3.4	And Jonah began to go into the city a journey of one day, and he cried out and said, “Forty more days and Nineveh will be demolished!”
JON.3.5	And the people of Nineveh believed in God, and they proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth—from the greatest of them to the least important.
JON.3.6	And the news reached the king of Nineveh, and he rose from his throne and removed his royal robe, put on sackcloth, and sat in the ashes. 
JON.3.7	And he had a proclamation made, and said, 
JON.3.7	“In Nineveh, by a decree of the king and his nobles: 
JON.3.7	“No human being or animal, no herd or flock, shall taste anything! They must not eat, and they must not drink water! 
JON.3.8	And the human beings and the animals must be covered with sackcloth! And they must call forcefully to God, and each must turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his
JON.3.9	Who knows? God may relent and change his mind and turn from his blazing anger
JON.3.10	And God saw their deeds—that they turned from their evil ways—and God changed his mind about the evil that he had said he would bring upon them, and he did not do it.
JON.4.1	And this
JON.4.2	And he prayed to Yahweh and said, “O Yahweh, was this not what I said
JON.4.3	And so then, Yahweh, please take my life from me, because for me death is better than life!” 
JON.4.4	And Yahweh said, “Is it right for you to be angry?”
JON.4.5	And Jonah went out from the city and sat down east of the city, and he made for himself a shelter there. And he sat under it in the shade, waiting to see
JON.4.6	And Yahweh God appointed a plant,
JON.4.7	So God appointed a worm at daybreak
JON.4.8	And when the sun rose,
JON.4.9	So God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry
JON.4.10	But Yahweh said, “You are troubled about the plant, for which you did not labor nor cause it to grow. It grew up in a night and it perished in a night!
JON.4.11	And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, the great city, in which there are
MIC.1.1	The word of Yahweh that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah, that he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem: 
MIC.1.2	Hear, all you peoples; 
MIC.1.2	give heed, O earth and its fullness. 
MIC.1.2	And let the Lord Yahweh be against you as a witness, 
MIC.1.2	the Lord from his holy temple.
MIC.1.3	For behold, Yahweh is coming out from his place, 
MIC.1.3	and he will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth. 
MIC.1.4	The mountains will melt under him 
MIC.1.4	and the valleys will burst open, 
MIC.1.4	like wax before the fire, 
MIC.1.4	like water rushing down a slope. 
MIC.1.5	All this is for the rebellion of Jacob, 
MIC.1.5	and for the sins of the house of Israel. 
MIC.1.5	What is the rebellion of Jacob? 
MIC.1.5	Is it not Samaria? 
MIC.1.5	And what are the high places of Judah? 
MIC.1.5	Are they not Jerusalem? 
MIC.1.6	So I will make Samaria as a heap of rubble in the field, 
MIC.1.6	a place for planting a vineyard. 
MIC.1.6	And I will pour down her stones into the valley 
MIC.1.6	and uncover her foundations. 
MIC.1.7	Then all her idols will be broken in pieces, 
MIC.1.7	and all her prostitution wages will be burned in the fire, 
MIC.1.7	and all her idols I will make a desolation, 
MIC.1.7	For from the wage of a prostitute she gathered them, 
MIC.1.7	and to the wage of a prostitute they will return. 
MIC.1.8	On account of this I will lament and wail. 
MIC.1.8	I will go about barefoot and naked. 
MIC.1.8	I will make a lamentation like the jackals, 
MIC.1.8	and a mourning ceremony like the ostriches.
MIC.1.9	For her wounds are incurable, 
MIC.1.9	because it has come to Judah. 
MIC.1.9	It has reached to the gate of my people, to Jerusalem. 
MIC.1.10	Do not tell it in Gath; 
MIC.1.10	you must not weep at all. 
MIC.1.10	In Beth-le-Aphrah 
MIC.1.10	roll yourself in dust. 
MIC.1.11	Pass on, you inhabitants of Shaphir, 
MIC.1.11	in naked shame. 
MIC.1.11	The inhabitants of Zaanan do not come forth; 
MIC.1.11	the wailing of Beth-ha-Ezel will take its protection from you. 
MIC.1.12	For the inhabitants of Maroth 
MIC.1.12	writhed for good, 
MIC.1.12	because disaster has come down from Yahweh 
MIC.1.12	to the gate of Jerusalem. 
MIC.1.13	Harness the chariot to the team of horses, 
MIC.1.13	O inhabitants of Lachish; 
MIC.1.13	it is the beginning of sin 
MIC.1.13	for the daughter of Zion, 
MIC.1.13	for the transgressions of Israel 
MIC.1.13	were found in you. 
MIC.1.14	Therefore you will give parting gifts 
MIC.1.14	to Moresheth-Gath; 
MIC.1.14	the houses of Achzib will be a deception 
MIC.1.14	to the kings of Israel. 
MIC.1.15	I will again bring the conqueror upon you, 
MIC.1.15	O inhabitants of Mareshah; 
MIC.1.15	the glory of Israel 
MIC.1.15	will come to Adullam. 
MIC.1.16	Make yourselves bald 
MIC.1.16	and cut off your hair 
MIC.1.16	for the children of your pleasure. 
MIC.1.16	Expand your baldness as the eagle, 
MIC.1.16	for they will go into exile away from you. 
MIC.2.1	Woe to those who plan wickedness 
MIC.2.1	and evil deeds upon their beds! 
MIC.2.1	In the light of the morning they did it, 
MIC.2.1	because they have power in their hands. 
MIC.2.2	They covet fields and seize them, 
MIC.2.2	and houses, and they take them away. 
MIC.2.2	They oppress a man and his house; 
MIC.2.2	a man and his inheritance. 
MIC.2.3	Therefore, thus says Yahweh: Look! I am planning disaster against this family from which you will not be able to remove your necks. You will not walk proudly, for it is a time of disaster. 
MIC.2.4	In that day they will raise a proverb against you, 
MIC.2.4	and will wail a bitter wailing, saying, 
MIC.2.4	“We are utterly ruined; 
MIC.2.4	he exchanges the portion of my people. 
MIC.2.4	How he removes it from me; 
MIC.2.4	he apportions our field to an apostate.” 
MIC.2.5	Therefore you will have no one casting a line by lot 
MIC.2.5	in the assembly of Yahweh. 
MIC.2.6	“Do not preach!” they are preaching. 
MIC.2.6	They should not preach to these; 
MIC.2.6	disgrace will not overtake us. 
MIC.2.7	Should this be said, O house of Jacob? 
MIC.2.7	Is the patience
MIC.2.7	Are these his deeds? 
MIC.2.7	Are my words not pleasing 
MIC.2.7	to him who walks upright? 
MIC.2.8	But recently
MIC.2.8	from before the cloak you strip off the robe 
MIC.2.8	from those passing by in confidence, 
MIC.2.8	returning from war. 
MIC.2.9	You have driven out the women of my people 
MIC.2.9	from the houses of their
MIC.2.9	From their
MIC.2.9	my glory forever. 
MIC.2.10	Arise and go, 
MIC.2.10	for this is no resting place, 
MIC.2.10	on account of uncleanness that destroys 
MIC.2.10	with painful destruction. 
MIC.2.11	If a man walks about in a spirit of deception and lies, 
MIC.2.11	saying “I will preach to you of wine and strong drink,” 
MIC.2.11	then he would be a preacher for this people! 
MIC.2.12	I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; 
MIC.2.12	I will surely gather together the remainder of Israel. 
MIC.2.12	I will set them like sheep of Bozrah. 
MIC.2.12	Like a herd in the midst of their pasture 
MIC.2.12	they will be in tumult from people. 
MIC.2.13	The one who breaks out before them goes up; 
MIC.2.13	they break through and pass the gate, 
MIC.2.13	going out through it. 
MIC.2.13	Their king passes before them, 
MIC.2.13	Yahweh at their head. 
MIC.3.1	And I said, 
MIC.3.1	“Listen, O heads of Jacob 
MIC.3.1	and leaders of the house of Israel! 
MIC.3.1	Is it not for you to know justice? 
MIC.3.2	Those of you who are haters of good 
MIC.3.2	and lovers of evil, 
MIC.3.2	who tear their skin from them 
MIC.3.2	and their flesh from their bones, 
MIC.3.3	and who eat the flesh of my people, 
MIC.3.3	and strip their skin from them, 
MIC.3.3	and break their bones, 
MIC.3.3	and chop them like meat in the pot, 
MIC.3.3	and like flesh in the midst of a cooking pot.” 
MIC.3.4	Then they will cry to Yahweh, 
MIC.3.4	but he will not answer them. 
MIC.3.4	He will hide his face from them at that time, 
MIC.3.4	when they have made their deeds evil. 
MIC.3.5	Thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets 
MIC.3.5	who are leading my people astray, 
MIC.3.5	who are biting with their teeth 
MIC.3.5	and proclaim, “Peace,” 
MIC.3.5	but whoever puts nothing into their mouths 
MIC.3.5	they declare war against. 
MIC.3.6	Therefore it will be as night to you, without vision, 
MIC.3.6	and darkness to you, without divination. 
MIC.3.6	And the sun will set on the prophets, 
MIC.3.6	and the day will grow dark over them. 
MIC.3.7	Then the seers will be disgraced, 
MIC.3.7	and those practicing divination will be put to shame. 
MIC.3.7	All of them will cover their lips, 
MIC.3.7	for there is no reply from God. 
MIC.3.8	But I, I am filled with power, 
MIC.3.8	with the Spirit of Yahweh, 
MIC.3.8	and with justice and might, 
MIC.3.8	to declare to Jacob his rebellion, 
MIC.3.8	and to Israel his sin. 
MIC.3.9	Hear this, O rulers of the house of Jacob 
MIC.3.9	and leaders of the house of Israel, 
MIC.3.9	those detesting justice 
MIC.3.9	and perverting all that is right, 
MIC.3.10	he who builds Zion with blood 
MIC.3.10	and Jerusalem with wickedness. 
MIC.3.11	Its rulers judge for a bribe; 
MIC.3.11	its priests teach for a price; 
MIC.3.11	its prophets practice divination for money. 
MIC.3.11	But they lean on Yahweh, saying, 
MIC.3.11	“Is not Yahweh in our midst? 
MIC.3.11	Disaster will not come upon us.” 
MIC.3.12	Therefore on account of you 
MIC.3.12	Zion will be plowed as a field, 
MIC.3.12	and Jerusalem will be a heap of rubble, 
MIC.3.12	and the temple mount
MIC.4.1	And it will be that at the end of those days, 
MIC.4.1	the mountain of Yahweh 
MIC.4.1	will be established as the highest of the mountains, 
MIC.4.1	and it will be lifted up above the hills, 
MIC.4.1	and people will stream to it. 
MIC.4.2	And many nations will come and say, 
MIC.4.2	“Come! Let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, 
MIC.4.2	and to the temple
MIC.4.2	that he may teach us his ways, 
MIC.4.2	and that we may walk in his paths,” 
MIC.4.2	for the law will go out from Zion, 
MIC.4.2	and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem. 
MIC.4.3	And he will judge between many peoples 
MIC.4.3	and will arbitrate for strong nations far away; 
MIC.4.3	and they will beat their swords into plowshares 
MIC.4.3	and their spears into pruning hooks; 
MIC.4.3	nation will not lift up a sword against a nation, 
MIC.4.3	and they will no longer learn war. 
MIC.4.4	But they will sit, each under his vine 
MIC.4.4	and under his fig tree, 
MIC.4.4	and no one will make them afraid, 
MIC.4.4	for the mouth of Yahweh of hosts has spoken. 
MIC.4.5	For all the nations walk, 
MIC.4.5	each in the name of its god, 
MIC.4.5	but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God, 
MIC.4.5	forever and ever. 
MIC.4.6	“In that day,” declares Yahweh,
MIC.4.6	“I will assemble the one who limps, 
MIC.4.6	and I will gather the one who has been scattered, 
MIC.4.6	and those whom I have mistreated. 
MIC.4.7	And I will make the one who limps a remnant, 
MIC.4.7	and the one driven far away a strong nation, 
MIC.4.7	and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion 
MIC.4.7	from now to forever. 
MIC.4.8	And you, O Migdal-Eder,
MIC.4.8	hill of the daughter of Zion, 
MIC.4.8	to you it will come, 
MIC.4.8	and the former dominion will come, 
MIC.4.8	the reign of the daughter of Jerusalem. 
MIC.4.9	So then, why do you shout a loud shout? 
MIC.4.9	Is there no king in you? 
MIC.4.9	Has your counselor perished 
MIC.4.9	that pangs like a woman in labor have seized you? 
MIC.4.10	Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion, 
MIC.4.10	like a woman in labor. 
MIC.4.10	For now you will go forth from the city, 
MIC.4.10	and you will camp in the field; 
MIC.4.10	you will go to Babylon. 
MIC.4.10	There you will be rescued; 
MIC.4.10	there Yahweh will redeem you 
MIC.4.10	from the hand of your enemies. 
MIC.4.11	And now, many nations are gathered against you 
MIC.4.11	who are saying, ‘Let her be defiled, 
MIC.4.11	and let our eyes gaze upon Zion.’ 
MIC.4.12	But they do not know the thoughts of Yahweh, 
MIC.4.12	and they do not understand his plan, 
MIC.4.12	that he has gathered them as sheaves 
MIC.4.12	to his threshing floor. 
MIC.4.13	Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, 
MIC.4.13	for your horn I will make as iron 
MIC.4.13	and your hooves as bronze. 
MIC.4.13	And you will break many peoples in pieces, 
MIC.4.13	and their gain you will devote to destruction to Yahweh, 
MIC.4.13	and their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.” 
MIC.5.1	 Now muster troops, O daughter of troops; 
MIC.5.1	a siege he puts against us. 
MIC.5.1	They strike the ruler of Israel 
MIC.5.1	with a rod on the cheek. 
MIC.5.2	But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, 
MIC.5.2	too small to be among the clans of Judah, 
MIC.5.2	from you one will go out for me, 
MIC.5.2	to be ruler in Israel; 
MIC.5.2	and his origins are from of old, 
MIC.5.2	from ancient days. 
MIC.5.3	Therefore he will give them up 
MIC.5.3	until the time of she who is with child has given birth. 
MIC.5.3	And the rest of his brothers will return 
MIC.5.3	to the children of Israel. 
MIC.5.4	And he will stand and shepherd his flock 
MIC.5.4	in the strength of Yahweh, 
MIC.5.4	in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God. 
MIC.5.4	And they will live, 
MIC.5.4	for now he will be great unto the ends of the earth. 
MIC.5.5	And this one will be peace. 
MIC.5.5	As for the Assyrian,
MIC.5.5	and when he treads on our fortresses, 
MIC.5.5	then we will raise up against him seven shepherds 
MIC.5.5	and eight leaders of men. 
MIC.5.6	And they will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, 
MIC.5.6	and the land of Nimrod at its entrances. 
MIC.5.6	And he will rescue us from the Assyrian
MIC.5.6	when he comes into our land, 
MIC.5.6	and when they tread upon our border. 
MIC.5.7	And the remnant of Jacob will be 
MIC.5.7	in the midst of many nations, 
MIC.5.7	like dew from Yahweh, 
MIC.5.7	like showers upon the grass 
MIC.5.7	which does not wait for a man, 
MIC.5.7	nor delays for the children of humankind. 
MIC.5.8	And the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, 
MIC.5.8	in the midst of many peoples, 
MIC.5.8	like a lion among the wild animals of the forest, 
MIC.5.8	like a young lion among the herds of sheep 
MIC.5.8	which, when it passes through and treads down 
MIC.5.8	and tears in pieces, there is none who can deliver. 
MIC.5.9	Your hand will be lifted high over your enemies, 
MIC.5.9	and all your foes will be cut off. 
MIC.5.10	“And it will happen that in that day,” declares
MIC.5.10	“then I will cut off your horses from among you, 
MIC.5.10	and I will destroy your chariots. 
MIC.5.11	And I will cut off the cities of your land, 
MIC.5.11	and I will demolish all your fortifications. 
MIC.5.12	And I will cut off sorceries from your hand, 
MIC.5.12	and you will not have soothsayers. 
MIC.5.13	And I will cut off your idols 
MIC.5.13	and your stone pillars from among you, 
MIC.5.13	and you will no longer bow down 
MIC.5.13	to the work of your hands. 
MIC.5.14	And I will uproot your Asherahs from among you, 
MIC.5.14	and I will destroy your cities. 
MIC.5.15	And in anger and in wrath I will execute vengeance 
MIC.5.15	on the nations who did not obey.” 
MIC.6.1	Hear now what Yahweh says: 
MIC.6.1	“Arise! Plead your case with the mountains, 
MIC.6.1	and let the hills hear your voice.” 
MIC.6.2	Hear, O mountains, the indictment of Yahweh, 
MIC.6.2	and you eternal foundations of the earth, 
MIC.6.2	for Yahweh has an indictment against his people, 
MIC.6.2	and against Israel he contends. 
MIC.6.3	“O my people, what have I done to you, 
MIC.6.3	and how have I wearied you? Answer me! 
MIC.6.4	For I brought you up from the land of Egypt, 
MIC.6.4	and from the house of slavery I redeemed you. 
MIC.6.4	And I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam before you. 
MIC.6.5	O my people, remember what Balak the king of Moab devised, 
MIC.6.5	and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, 
MIC.6.5	and what happened from Shittim to Gilgal, 
MIC.6.5	so that you might know the righteous acts of Yahweh.” 
MIC.6.6	With what shall I approach Yahweh, 
MIC.6.6	and bow down to God on high? 
MIC.6.6	Shall I approach him with burnt offerings, 
MIC.6.6	with bull calves a year old? 
MIC.6.7	Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams, 
MIC.6.7	with myriads of rivers of oil? 
MIC.6.7	Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, 
MIC.6.7	the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 
MIC.6.8	He has told you, O mortal, what is good, 
MIC.6.8	and what does Yahweh ask from you 
MIC.6.8	but to do justice, and to love kindness, 
MIC.6.8	and to walk humbly with your God? 
MIC.6.9	The voice of Yahweh calls to the city 
MIC.6.9	(it is sound judgment to fear your name): 
MIC.6.9	“Hear, O staff!
MIC.6.10	Is there any longer a man in the house of the wicked 
MIC.6.10	treasures of wickedness, 
MIC.6.10	and the ephah of scarcity which is accursed?
MIC.6.11	Shall I regard as pure the one with scales of wickedness, 
MIC.6.11	and with a bag of deceitful weights? 
MIC.6.12	Because her rich are full of violence, 
MIC.6.12	and her inhabitants speak lies, 
MIC.6.12	and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. 
MIC.6.13	And I also have made you sick by striking you down,
MIC.6.13	making you desolate because of your sins. 
MIC.6.14	You yourself will eat but not be satisfied; 
MIC.6.14	your hunger will be in your midst, 
MIC.6.14	and you will put away, but you will not save, 
MIC.6.14	and what you save I will hand over to the sword. 
MIC.6.15	You yourself will sow, but you will not reap; 
MIC.6.15	you will tread olives, but you will not anoint yourself with oil; 
MIC.6.15	you will tread grapes, but you will not drink wine. 
MIC.6.16	For you have observed the regulations of Omri 
MIC.6.16	and all the works of the house of Ahab. 
MIC.6.16	And you have walked in their counsels, 
MIC.6.16	so that I am making you a desolation 
MIC.6.16	and your inhabitants an object of scorn. 
MIC.6.16	So you will bear the scorn of my people. 
MIC.7.1	Woe is me! For I have become 
MIC.7.1	like the gatherings of summer, 
MIC.7.1	like the gleanings of the grape harvest, 
MIC.7.1	when there is no cluster of grapes to eat 
MIC.7.1	or early ripened fruit that my soul desires. 
MIC.7.2	The faithful person has perished from the land, 
MIC.7.2	and there is none who is upright among humankind. 
MIC.7.2	All of them lie in wait; 
MIC.7.2	each hunts his brother with a net. 
MIC.7.3	Their hands are upon evil, to do it well; 
MIC.7.3	the official and the judge ask for the bribe, 
MIC.7.3	and the great man utters the evil desire of his soul; 
MIC.7.3	and they weave it together. 
MIC.7.4	The best of them is like a brier; 
MIC.7.4	the most upright worse than a thorn hedge. 
MIC.7.4	The day of your watchman, your punishment, has come; 
MIC.7.4	now their confusion will come. 
MIC.7.5	Do not put faith in a friend; 
MIC.7.5	put no trust in a close friend. 
MIC.7.5	Guard the doorways of your mouth 
MIC.7.5	from the one who lies in your lap. 
MIC.7.6	For a son treats a father with contempt; 
MIC.7.6	a daughter rises up against her mother, 
MIC.7.6	a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 
MIC.7.6	the enemies of a man are the men of his own house. 
MIC.7.7	But as for me, I will look to Yahweh; 
MIC.7.7	I will wait for the God of my salvation. 
MIC.7.7	My God will hear me. 
MIC.7.8	You should not rejoice over me, O my enemy! 
MIC.7.8	When I fall I will stand up; 
MIC.7.8	when I sit in darkness 
MIC.7.8	Yahweh will be a light for me. 
MIC.7.9	I will bear the rage of Yahweh, 
MIC.7.9	for I have sinned against him, 
MIC.7.9	until he pleads my cause 
MIC.7.9	and executes my justice. 
MIC.7.9	He will bring me out to the light; 
MIC.7.9	I will see his righteousness. 
MIC.7.10	Then my enemy will see, 
MIC.7.10	and shame will cover her who said to me, 
MIC.7.10	“Where is Yahweh your God?” 
MIC.7.10	My eyes will look upon her; 
MIC.7.10	now she will become a trampling place, 
MIC.7.10	like mud in the streets. 
MIC.7.11	A day for building your walls; 
MIC.7.11	on that day he will extend your boundary. 
MIC.7.12	On that day he will come to you 
MIC.7.12	from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, 
MIC.7.12	and from Egypt to the River, 
MIC.7.12	and from sea to sea 
MIC.7.12	and mountain to mountain. 
MIC.7.13	But the earth will be a desolation 
MIC.7.13	because of its inhabitants, 
MIC.7.13	for the fruit of their deeds. 
MIC.7.14	Shepherd your people with your staff, 
MIC.7.14	the flock of your inheritance, 
MIC.7.14	those dwelling alone in a forest 
MIC.7.14	in the midst of Carmel. 
MIC.7.14	Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, 
MIC.7.14	as in the days of old. 
MIC.7.15	As in the days when you came out 
MIC.7.15	from the land of Egypt 
MIC.7.15	I will show him wondrous things. 
MIC.7.16	The nations will see and be ashamed 
MIC.7.16	because of all their might. 
MIC.7.16	They will lay the hand on the mouth; 
MIC.7.16	their ears will be deaf. 
MIC.7.17	They will lick the dust like the serpent, 
MIC.7.17	like the crawling things of the earth. 
MIC.7.17	They will come trembling from their strongholds 
MIC.7.17	to Yahweh our God. 
MIC.7.17	Let them fear and be afraid of you. 
MIC.7.18	Who is a God like you, forgiving sin 
MIC.7.18	and passing over rebellion for the remnant of his inheritance? 
MIC.7.18	He does not retain his anger forever, 
MIC.7.18	for he delights in loyal love. 
MIC.7.19	He will again have compassion
MIC.7.19	he will trample our iniquities. 
MIC.7.19	And you will hurl all their sins 
MIC.7.19	in the depths of the sea. 
MIC.7.20	You will show faithfulness to Jacob, 
MIC.7.20	and loyal love to Abraham, 
MIC.7.20	as you have sworn to our ancestors
MIC.7.20	from the days of old. 
NAM.1.1	The oracle concerning Nineveh— 
NAM.1.1	the scroll of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite: 
NAM.1.2	Yahweh is a jealous God and avenging; 
NAM.1.2	Yahweh is avenging and full of wrath.
NAM.1.2	Yahweh takes vengeance against his enemies; 
NAM.1.2	he rages against his adversaries. 
NAM.1.3	Yahweh is slow to anger but great in power; 
NAM.1.3	he will certainly not allow the guilty to go unpunished. 
NAM.1.3	He marches
NAM.1.3	storm clouds are the dust of his feet. 
NAM.1.4	He rebukes the sea and he dries up the rivers; 
NAM.1.4	he makes all the rivers run dry. 
NAM.1.4	Bashan and Carmel wither;
NAM.1.4	the blossom of Lebanon languishes. 
NAM.1.5	Mountains quake before him; 
NAM.1.5	the hills shake apart.
NAM.1.5	The earth heaves before him— 
NAM.1.5	the world and all her inhabitants. 
NAM.1.6	His indignation—who can stand before it? 
NAM.1.6	Who can endure his fierce anger?
NAM.1.6	His wrath is poured out like fire; 
NAM.1.6	rocks are shattered before
NAM.1.7	Yahweh is good—a refuge in the day of distress; 
NAM.1.7	he knows those who take refuge in him. 
NAM.1.8	But with a rushing torrent he will bring Nineveh to an end; 
NAM.1.8	he will chase his enemies into darkness. 
NAM.1.9	What
NAM.1.9	He will completely destroy it;
NAM.1.9	trouble will not rise up a second time! 
NAM.1.10	For like entangled thorns, 
NAM.1.10	and like their drink which is drunk, 
NAM.1.10	they will be consumed like fully dry chaff. 
NAM.1.11	From you goes out one who plots evil against Yahweh, 
NAM.1.11	one who plans wickedness. 
NAM.1.12	Yahweh says this: 
NAM.1.12	“Even though they are powerful and likewise many, 
NAM.1.12	even so they will be cut off and pass away. 
NAM.1.12	Though I have afflicted you,
NAM.1.12	I will afflict you
NAM.1.13	And now, I will break his yoke from upon you; 
NAM.1.13	I will snap your bonds.” 
NAM.1.14	Yahweh has commanded concerning you: 
NAM.1.14	“Your name will no longer be sown. 
NAM.1.14	I will cut off the idols and images
NAM.1.14	I will send you to the grave
NAM.1.15	 Look! On the mountains! 
NAM.1.15	The feet of the one who brings good tidings, 
NAM.1.15	the one who proclaims peace! 
NAM.1.15	“Celebrate a festival, O Judah, 
NAM.1.15	Fulfill your vows! 
NAM.1.15	For he will not invade you again; 
NAM.1.15	the wicked one is cut off completely!” 
NAM.2.1	One who shatters
NAM.2.1	Guard the fortification! 
NAM.2.1	Watch the road!
NAM.2.1	Gird your loins! 
NAM.2.1	Muster
NAM.2.2	For Yahweh will restore the majesty of Jacob 
NAM.2.2	like the majesty of Israel; 
NAM.2.2	for ravagers have ravaged them 
NAM.2.2	and ruined their branches. 
NAM.2.3	The shields of his warriors are dyed red; 
NAM.2.3	The powerful men are dressed in scarlet. 
NAM.2.3	The metal of the chariots
NAM.2.3	and their spears quiver. 
NAM.2.4	The chariots
NAM.2.4	they rush back and forth in the public squares. 
NAM.2.4	Their appearance like lightning bolts, 
NAM.2.4	they dart about like flashes of lightning. 
NAM.2.5	He calls his officers; 
NAM.2.5	they stumble as they march; 
NAM.2.5	they rush to her wall; 
NAM.2.5	they set the covering
NAM.2.6	The gates of the river are opened; 
NAM.2.6	the palace trembles. 
NAM.2.7	Her goddess is taken out and taken into exile;
NAM.2.7	her maidservants moan like doves; 
NAM.2.7	they beat on their breasts. 
NAM.2.8	Nineveh is like a pool of water without its water.
NAM.2.8	As they flee,
NAM.2.8	But there is no one who turns back. 
NAM.2.9	Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! 
NAM.2.9	There is no end to the spoils,
NAM.2.9	an abundance of everything one could want!
NAM.2.10	Emptiness and plundering and devastation! 
NAM.2.10	Their hearts faint and their knees tremble,
NAM.2.10	All their loins shake
NAM.2.11	Where now is the den of the lions 
NAM.2.11	and the cave of the fierce lions? 
NAM.2.11	There the lioness, the cub, and the lion once prowled,
NAM.2.11	and no one disturbed them.
NAM.2.12	The lion tore apart enough prey for his cubs, 
NAM.2.12	he strangled prey for his lioness; 
NAM.2.12	he filled his lair
NAM.2.12	and his den with mangled carcass. 
NAM.2.13	“Look! I am against you!” declares
NAM.2.13	“I will burn her chariots with fire;
NAM.2.13	the sword will devour fierce lions. 
NAM.2.13	I will cut off your prey from the earth; 
NAM.2.13	the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard.” 
NAM.3.1	Woe to the city that has shed much blood!
NAM.3.1	She is a deceiver,
NAM.3.1	She is filled with plunder, 
NAM.3.1	She has hoarded her spoils of war.
NAM.3.2	The crack of the whip! 
NAM.3.2	The rumbling of the chariot wheel! 
NAM.3.2	The galloping of the horse! 
NAM.3.2	The racing of the chariot! 
NAM.3.3	Chariots charge! 
NAM.3.3	Swords flash! 
NAM.3.3	Spears glitter! 
NAM.3.3	Many corpses are piled high!
NAM.3.3	There is no end to the slain! 
NAM.3.3	They stumble over their dead! 
NAM.3.4	“Because of the many idolatries of the prostitute, 
NAM.3.4	the beautiful charm of a mistress of witchcraft, 
NAM.3.4	she who enslaves nations by her harlotries, 
NAM.3.4	and peoples by her sorceries, 
NAM.3.5	“Look! I am against you!” declares
NAM.3.5	“I will strip up your skirts over your face; 
NAM.3.5	I will let nations look at your nakedness and your shame. 
NAM.3.6	“I will throw filth upon you, 
NAM.3.6	I will treat you with contempt, 
NAM.3.6	I will make you a spectacle. 
NAM.3.7	“And it will be that everyone who sees you will flee from you, 
NAM.3.7	And they
NAM.3.7	Who will mourn for her? 
NAM.3.7	From whence shall I seek comforters for you?” 
NAM.3.8	Are you better than Thebes?
NAM.3.8	She who sits at the Nile, surrounded by her waters, 
NAM.3.8	her rampart was the sea and water was her wall. 
NAM.3.9	Cush was her strength, Egypt without end; 
NAM.3.9	Put and Libya were among your allies.
NAM.3.10	Yet she went into captivity as an exile; 
NAM.3.10	her children were dashed to pieces at the head of the streets; 
NAM.3.10	they cast lots for all of her nobles; 
NAM.3.10	all of her dignitaries were bound with chains. 
NAM.3.11	You also will behave like a drunkard; 
NAM.3.11	You also will hide yourself; 
NAM.3.11	You also will seek refuge from the enemy. 
NAM.3.12	All of your fortifications are like fig trees with ripe firstfruits— 
NAM.3.12	if they are shaken, they will fall into the mouth of the eater. 
NAM.3.13	Look! Your troops are like women in your midst. 
NAM.3.13	The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; 
NAM.3.13	fire will consume the bars of your gates. 
NAM.3.14	Draw water for a siege! 
NAM.3.14	Strengthen your fortifications! 
NAM.3.14	Go to the mud pit! 
NAM.3.14	Trample the clay! 
NAM.3.14	Grasp the brick mold! 
NAM.3.15	There fire will consume you; 
NAM.3.15	the sword will cut you off. 
NAM.3.15	It will consume you like the locust. 
NAM.3.15	Multiply yourself like the locust! 
NAM.3.15	Multiply yourself like the grasshopper! 
NAM.3.16	You have increased your merchants more than the stars of heaven; 
NAM.3.16	like the locust they will shed their skin and fly away. 
NAM.3.17	Your officials are like locusts; 
NAM.3.17	your commanders are like a swarm of locusts. 
NAM.3.17	They encamp on the walls on a cold day; 
NAM.3.17	when the sun rises, they fly away— 
NAM.3.17	no one knows where they have gone. 
NAM.3.18	Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria! 
NAM.3.18	Your nobles slumber. 
NAM.3.18	Your people are scattered on the mountains; 
NAM.3.18	no one can gather them. 
NAM.3.19	There is no healing for your wound; 
NAM.3.19	your injury is fatal. 
NAM.3.19	All who hear the report of you will clap their hands for joy concerning you, 
NAM.3.19	For who has not suffered at the hands of your endless cruelty?
HAB.1.1	The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw. 
HAB.1.2	O Yahweh, how long shall I cry for help 
HAB.1.2	and you will not listen? 
HAB.1.2	How long will I cry out to you, “Violence!” 
HAB.1.2	and you will not save? 
HAB.1.3	Why do you cause me to see evil 
HAB.1.3	while you look at trouble? 
HAB.1.3	Destruction and violence happen before me; 
HAB.1.3	contention and strife arise. 
HAB.1.4	Therefore the law is paralyzed, 
HAB.1.4	and justice does not go forth perpetually.
HAB.1.4	For the wicked surround the righteous; 
HAB.1.4	therefore justice goes forth perverted. 
HAB.1.5	“Look among the nations and see; 
HAB.1.5	be astonished and astounded. 
HAB.1.5	For a work is about to be done in your days 
HAB.1.5	that you will not believe if it is told. 
HAB.1.6	For look! I am raising up the Chaldeans, 
HAB.1.6	the bitter and impetuous nation, 
HAB.1.6	the one who walks through the spacious places of earth 
HAB.1.6	to take possession of dwellings not belonging to it.
HAB.1.7	They
HAB.1.7	their
HAB.1.8	Their
HAB.1.8	they are more menacing than wolves at dusk. 
HAB.1.8	Their
HAB.1.8	they fly like an eagle that is swift to devour. 
HAB.1.9	All of them
HAB.1.9	their faces pressing forward. 
HAB.1.9	They gather captives like the sand. 
HAB.1.10	And they themselves scoff at kings 
HAB.1.10	and rulers are a joke to them. 
HAB.1.10	They laugh at every fortification, 
HAB.1.10	and they heap up earth and take it. 
HAB.1.11	Then they sweep like the wind and pass on; 
HAB.1.11	they become guilty, whose might is their
HAB.1.12	Are you not from of old, 
HAB.1.12	O Yahweh my God, my Holy One? 
HAB.1.12	You
HAB.1.12	O Yahweh, you have marked them
HAB.1.12	O Rock, you have established them
HAB.1.13	Your eyes are too pure to see evil, 
HAB.1.13	and you are not able to look at wrongdoing.
HAB.1.13	Why do you look at the treacherous? 
HAB.1.13	Why are you silent when the wicked swallows up 
HAB.1.13	someone more righteous than him? 
HAB.1.14	You make humankind like fish of the sea, 
HAB.1.14	like crawling creatures that have no ruler among them. 
HAB.1.15	He brings up all of them with a fishhook; 
HAB.1.15	he drags them up with a fishnet; 
HAB.1.15	he gathers them in his dragnet. 
HAB.1.15	Therefore, he rejoices and exults. 
HAB.1.16	Therefore he sacrifices to his fishnet 
HAB.1.16	and makes offerings to his dragnet, 
HAB.1.16	for by them he makes a good living
HAB.1.16	and his food is rich. 
HAB.1.17	Will he therefore empty his fishnet 
HAB.1.17	and continually kill nations without showing mercy? 
HAB.2.1	I will stand at my post, 
HAB.2.1	and station myself on the rampart. 
HAB.2.1	And I will keep watch to see what he will say to me, 
HAB.2.1	and what he will answer concerning my complaint. 
HAB.2.2	Then Yahweh answered me and said, 
HAB.2.2	“Write the vision and make it plain on the tablet 
HAB.2.2	so that it might be read quickly.
HAB.2.3	For there is yet a vision for the appointed time; 
HAB.2.3	it will give witness to the end, and it will not lie. 
HAB.2.3	If it tarries, wait for it, 
HAB.2.3	for it will surely come and not delay. 
HAB.2.4	Look! His spirit within him is puffed up; 
HAB.2.4	it is not upright. 
HAB.2.4	But the righteous shall live by his faithfulness. 
HAB.2.5	How much less
HAB.2.5	the arrogant, treacherous man? 
HAB.2.5	He who broadens his throat like Sheol, 
HAB.2.5	and who, like death, is not satisfied, 
HAB.2.5	and who gathers to himself all the nations, 
HAB.2.5	and harvested for himself all the peoples, 
HAB.2.5	will not succeed. 
HAB.2.6	Shall not all of these take up a taunt against him, 
HAB.2.6	with ridicule and riddles against him, saying, 
HAB.2.6	‘Woe to him who heaps up what is not his’? 
HAB.2.6	For how long? 
HAB.2.6	And, ‘Woe to him who makes himself heavy with pledges’? 
HAB.2.7	Will not your creditors suddenly rise up 
HAB.2.7	and awaken those who make you tremble? 
HAB.2.7	Then you shall be as plunder for them. 
HAB.2.8	Because you plundered many nations, 
HAB.2.8	all the remaining nations will plunder you 
HAB.2.8	on account of the blood of humanity 
HAB.2.8	and violence against the land, 
HAB.2.8	and against cities and all who live in them. 
HAB.2.9	Woe to him who obtains profit from evil gain for his house, 
HAB.2.9	to set his nest on high, 
HAB.2.9	to be saved from the hand of misfortune! 
HAB.2.10	You have plotted shame for your house, 
HAB.2.10	cutting off many peoples 
HAB.2.10	and sinning against your life. 
HAB.2.11	For the stone will cry out from the wall, 
HAB.2.11	and the plaster from the wood will answer it. 
HAB.2.12	Woe to him who builds a city by bloodguilt, 
HAB.2.12	and who founds a city by wickedness! 
HAB.2.13	Look! Is it not from Yahweh of hosts 
HAB.2.13	that people labor for mere fire, 
HAB.2.13	and nations exhaust themselves for mere vanity? 
HAB.2.14	For the earth will be filled 
HAB.2.14	with the knowledge of the glory of Yahweh, 
HAB.2.14	like the waters covering the sea. 
HAB.2.15	Woe to him who gives a drink to his neighbors, 
HAB.2.15	pouring out your wrath and also making them drunk 
HAB.2.15	in order to see their nakedness! 
HAB.2.16	You will be sated with shame rather than glory. 
HAB.2.16	Drink also yourself, and expose yourself! 
HAB.2.16	The cup of the right hand of Yahweh 
HAB.2.16	will come around upon you 
HAB.2.16	and disgrace upon your glory. 
HAB.2.17	For the violence of Lebanon will cover you, 
HAB.2.17	and the destruction of wild animals will shatter them 
HAB.2.17	on account of the blood of humanity, 
HAB.2.17	and the violence against the land, 
HAB.2.17	against a city and all the inhabitants in it. 
HAB.2.18	What value is an idol 
HAB.2.18	when its carver has fashioned it, 
HAB.2.18	a molten idol, a teacher of lies? 
HAB.2.18	For he who fashioned his creation trusts in it, 
HAB.2.18	though making mute idols! 
HAB.2.19	Woe to him who says to the wood, ‘Wake up!’ 
HAB.2.19	And to a lifeless stone, ‘Arise!’ 
HAB.2.19	Can he teach? 
HAB.2.19	Look, it is covered with gold and silver, 
HAB.2.19	and there is no breath within it. 
HAB.2.20	But Yahweh is in his holy temple. 
HAB.2.20	Let all the earth be silent before him.” 
HAB.3.1	A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth. 
HAB.3.2	O Yahweh, I have heard the report of you; 
HAB.3.2	O Yahweh, I stand in awe of your works. 
HAB.3.2	In the midst of the years, revive it! 
HAB.3.2	In the midst of the years, make it known! 
HAB.3.2	In wrath, may you remember to show compassion. 
HAB.3.3	God came from Teman; 
HAB.3.3	the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah 
HAB.3.3	His splendor covers the heavens, 
HAB.3.3	and his praise fills the earth. 
HAB.3.4	And his brightness was like the light; 
HAB.3.4	flashing rays came from his hand for him; 
HAB.3.4	And there is the covering of his strength. 
HAB.3.5	Before him went Disease,
HAB.3.5	and Pestilence
HAB.3.6	He stood and measured the earth; 
HAB.3.6	he looked and made the nations tremble. 
HAB.3.6	Then the mountains of old were shattered; 
HAB.3.6	the hills of old collapsed. 
HAB.3.6	The ways of old belong to him. 
HAB.3.7	Under affliction I saw the tents of Cushan; 
HAB.3.7	the tent curtains of the land of Midian trembled. 
HAB.3.8	Was the anger of Yahweh against the rivers? 
HAB.3.8	Was your wrath against the rivers, 
HAB.3.8	or your fury against the sea, 
HAB.3.8	when you mounted upon your horses, 
HAB.3.8	upon your victory chariot? 
HAB.3.9	You laid bare the nakedness of your bow, 
HAB.3.9	swearing oaths with the arrows of your word. 
HAB.3.9	You split the earth with rivers. 
HAB.3.10	When the mountains saw you they writhed; 
HAB.3.10	a torrent of waters swept by; 
HAB.3.10	the deep gave its voice; 
HAB.3.10	it raised its hands on high. 
HAB.3.11	Sun and moon stood still in their place; 
HAB.3.11	at the light of your arrows they moved about; 
HAB.3.11	at the gleam of the flashing of your spear. 
HAB.3.12	In fury you marched through the earth; 
HAB.3.12	in anger you trampled the nations. 
HAB.3.13	You went forth for the salvation of your people, 
HAB.3.13	for the salvation of your anointed. 
HAB.3.13	You crushed the head of the house of wickedness, 
HAB.3.13	laying bare from the foundation to the top.
HAB.3.14	You pierced the head of his warriors with his own arrows; 
HAB.3.14	they came like a whirlwind to scatter me, 
HAB.3.14	their exultation like one who devours the afflicted in ambush. 
HAB.3.15	You trampled upon the sea with your horses, 
HAB.3.15	the churning of many waters. 
HAB.3.16	I hear and my stomach shakes; 
HAB.3.16	my lips quiver at the sound; 
HAB.3.16	infection enters my bones; 
HAB.3.16	that which is beneath me trembles; 
HAB.3.16	I wait quietly for the day of trouble 
HAB.3.16	to come upon the people attacking us. 
HAB.3.17	Though the fig tree does not blossom, 
HAB.3.17	nor there be fruit on the vines; 
HAB.3.17	the yield of the olive tree fails, 
HAB.3.17	and the cultivated fields do not yield food; 
HAB.3.17	the flock is cut off from the animal pen, 
HAB.3.17	and there is no cattle in the stalls, 
HAB.3.18	Yet I will rejoice in Yahweh; 
HAB.3.18	I will exult in the God of my salvation. 
HAB.3.19	Yahweh, my Lord, is my strength; 
HAB.3.19	he makes my feet like the deer; 
HAB.3.19	he causes me to walk on my high places. 
HAB.3.19	To the choirmaster with stringed instruments. 
ZEP.1.1	The word of Yahweh that came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah. 
ZEP.1.2	“I will surely destroy everything 
ZEP.1.2	from the face of the earth”—a declaration of Yahweh. 
ZEP.1.3	“I will destroy humanity and beast; 
ZEP.1.3	I will destroy the birds of the sky 
ZEP.1.3	and the fish of the sea, 
ZEP.1.3	and the stumbling blocks
ZEP.1.3	And I will cut off humankind 
ZEP.1.3	from the face of the earth”—a declaration of Yahweh. 
ZEP.1.4	“And I will stretch out my hand against Judah 
ZEP.1.4	and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
ZEP.1.4	And I will cut off from this place 
ZEP.1.4	the remnant of Baal, 
ZEP.1.4	and the name of idolatrous priests with the priests,
ZEP.1.5	and those who bow down on the rooftops 
ZEP.1.5	to the host of heaven, 
ZEP.1.5	and those who bow down, swearing to Yahweh 
ZEP.1.5	but also swearing by Milkom,
ZEP.1.6	and those who turned back from following
ZEP.1.6	and who did not seek Yahweh, 
ZEP.1.6	and did not inquire of him.” 
ZEP.1.7	Be silent before the Lord Yahweh, 
ZEP.1.7	for the day of Yahweh draws near, 
ZEP.1.7	for Yahweh has provided a sacrifice 
ZEP.1.7	and has consecrated his guests. 
ZEP.1.8	And it shall be that on the day of the sacrifice of Yahweh, 
ZEP.1.8	I will punish the officials 
ZEP.1.8	and the sons of the king 
ZEP.1.8	and those who dress in foreign clothing. 
ZEP.1.9	And on that day I will punish 
ZEP.1.9	all who leap over the threshold, 
ZEP.1.9	who fill up the house of their master 
ZEP.1.9	with violence and deceit. 
ZEP.1.10	“And there shall be on that day”—a declaration of Yahweh— 
ZEP.1.10	“a loud outcry
ZEP.1.10	and a wailing from the Second District, 
ZEP.1.10	and a loud
ZEP.1.11	The inhabitants of the Mortar shall wail, 
ZEP.1.11	for all the traders have perished; 
ZEP.1.11	all who trade with silver have been cut off. 
ZEP.1.12	And it shall be that at that time 
ZEP.1.12	I will search Jerusalem with lamps, 
ZEP.1.12	and I will punish the men 
ZEP.1.12	whose senses are dulled from drinking,
ZEP.1.12	who say in their hearts, 
ZEP.1.12	‘Yahweh will not do good, nor will he do evil.’ 
ZEP.1.13	Then their wealth shall be as plunder, 
ZEP.1.13	and their homes as desolation. 
ZEP.1.13	And they shall build their houses and not inhabit them, 
ZEP.1.13	and they shall plant vineyards and not drink their wine.” 
ZEP.1.14	The great day of Yahweh draws near; 
ZEP.1.14	it is near and coming very swiftly. 
ZEP.1.14	The sound of the day of Yahweh is bitterness; 
ZEP.1.14	there, a warrior cries out! 
ZEP.1.15	That day will be a day of wrath, 
ZEP.1.15	a day of trouble and distress, 
ZEP.1.15	a day of disaster and ruination, 
ZEP.1.15	a day of darkness and deep gloom, 
ZEP.1.15	a day of clouds
ZEP.1.16	a day of trumpet and trumpet blast 
ZEP.1.16	against the fortified cities 
ZEP.1.16	and against the high corner towers. 
ZEP.1.17	And I will bring distress to all humankind, 
ZEP.1.17	and they shall walk about like the blind, 
ZEP.1.17	for they sinned against Yahweh; 
ZEP.1.17	their blood shall be poured out like dust 
ZEP.1.17	and their entrails like dung. 
ZEP.1.18	Moreover, their silver and their gold 
ZEP.1.18	will not be able to save them 
ZEP.1.18	on the day of the wrath of Yahweh. 
ZEP.1.18	And in the fire of his zeal, 
ZEP.1.18	the whole land shall be consumed, 
ZEP.1.18	for a terrifying end he shall make 
ZEP.1.18	for all the inhabitants of the land. 
ZEP.2.1	Gather yourselves together! Now gather together, 
ZEP.2.1	O nation having no shame! 
ZEP.2.2	Before the birth of the decree, 
ZEP.2.2	the day flies away like chaff; 
ZEP.2.2	before the fierce anger of Yahweh overtakes you; 
ZEP.2.2	before the day of the anger of Yahweh overtakes you. 
ZEP.2.3	Seek Yahweh, all you afflicted of the land 
ZEP.2.3	who have fulfilled his law; 
ZEP.2.3	seek righteousness; 
ZEP.2.3	seek humility. 
ZEP.2.3	Perhaps you will be concealed 
ZEP.2.3	on the day of the anger of Yahweh. 
ZEP.2.4	For Gaza will be abandoned, 
ZEP.2.4	and Ashkelon as a desolation. 
ZEP.2.4	As for Ashdod, at noon they will drive her away, 
ZEP.2.4	and Ekron shall be uprooted. 
ZEP.2.5	Woe to you, inhabitants of the region of the sea, 
ZEP.2.5	people of the Kerethites! 
ZEP.2.5	The word of Yahweh is against you, 
ZEP.2.5	O Canaan, land of the Philistines. 
ZEP.2.5	I will destroy you until there is no inhabitant.
ZEP.2.6	And you, O region of the sea, shall become 
ZEP.2.6	pastures and meadows for shepherds 
ZEP.2.6	and sheep pens for the flocks. 
ZEP.2.7	And it shall become a region 
ZEP.2.7	for the remnant of the house of Judah; 
ZEP.2.7	upon them they shall graze, 
ZEP.2.7	and in the houses of Ashkelon 
ZEP.2.7	they shall lie down in the evening. 
ZEP.2.7	For Yahweh their God shall be mindful of them, 
ZEP.2.7	and he will restore their fortunes. 
ZEP.2.8	I have heard the reproaches of Moab 
ZEP.2.8	and the scorning of the Ammonites,
ZEP.2.8	with which they have taunted my nation 
ZEP.2.8	and made boasts against their territory. 
ZEP.2.9	“Therefore, as I live”—a declaration of Yahweh of hosts, 
ZEP.2.9	the God of Israel— 
ZEP.2.9	“Moab shall be as Sodom, 
ZEP.2.9	and the Ammonites
ZEP.2.9	a place of weeds and salt pits 
ZEP.2.9	and a desolation forever. 
ZEP.2.9	The remnant of my people shall plunder them, 
ZEP.2.9	and the remainder of my nation shall possess them.” 
ZEP.2.10	This shall be for them in place of their pride 
ZEP.2.10	because they mocked and boasted 
ZEP.2.10	against the people of Yahweh of hosts. 
ZEP.2.11	Yahweh will be awesome against them, 
ZEP.2.11	for he will destroy all the gods of the earth 
ZEP.2.11	and all the lands
ZEP.2.11	each in its place will bow down to him. 
ZEP.2.12	You also, O Cushites, 
ZEP.2.12	they shall be killed by my sword. 
ZEP.2.13	And he will stretch out his hand against the north, 
ZEP.2.13	and he will destroy Assyria 
ZEP.2.13	and will make Nineveh a desolation, 
ZEP.2.13	a dry wasteland like the desert. 
ZEP.2.14	Herds shall lie down in her midst, 
ZEP.2.14	every wild animal of a nation; 
ZEP.2.14	even the desert owl and the screech owl 
ZEP.2.14	shall lodge on her capitals. 
ZEP.2.14	A voice shall hoot in the window; 
ZEP.2.14	rubble
ZEP.2.14	for the cedar is laid bare. 
ZEP.2.15	This is the city of rejoicing 
ZEP.2.15	that lived securely; 
ZEP.2.15	the one saying in her heart, 
ZEP.2.15	“I am, and there is none besides me.”
ZEP.2.15	How she has become a desolation, 
ZEP.2.15	a lair for wild animals! 
ZEP.2.15	Everyone who passes by her hisses and shakes his fist. 
ZEP.3.1	Woe to you, O rebellious and defiled one! 
ZEP.3.1	The oppressing city! 
ZEP.3.2	She listens to no voice; 
ZEP.3.2	she does not accept correction. 
ZEP.3.2	In Yahweh she does not trust; 
ZEP.3.2	to her God she does not draw near. 
ZEP.3.3	Her officials in her midst are roaring lions; 
ZEP.3.3	her judges are evening wolves; 
ZEP.3.3	they leave nothing until the morning. 
ZEP.3.4	Her prophets are arrogant men of treachery; 
ZEP.3.4	her priests have defiled that which is holy; 
ZEP.3.4	they do violence to the law. 
ZEP.3.5	Yahweh is righteous in her midst; 
ZEP.3.5	he does not do wickedness. 
ZEP.3.5	Morning by morning
ZEP.3.5	at dawn he does not fail, 
ZEP.3.5	but an evil one knows no shame. 
ZEP.3.6	“I have cut off nations; 
ZEP.3.6	their strongholds are deserted. 
ZEP.3.6	I have laid waste their streets, 
ZEP.3.6	so that none pass through. 
ZEP.3.6	Their cities have been destroyed 
ZEP.3.6	and are without a man, without an inhabitant. 
ZEP.3.7	I have said, ‘Surely she will fear me; 
ZEP.3.7	she will accept discipline. 
ZEP.3.7	Then her dwelling place will not be cut down, 
ZEP.3.7	nor all that I have brought upon her.’ 
ZEP.3.7	Surely they rise early; 
ZEP.3.7	they make all their deeds corrupt. 
ZEP.3.8	“Therefore, wait for me”—a declaration of Yahweh— 
ZEP.3.8	“for the day of my rising as a witness. 
ZEP.3.8	For my decision is to gather nations, 
ZEP.3.8	to assemble
ZEP.3.8	to pour out my wrath upon them, all my burning anger. 
ZEP.3.8	For by the fire of my anger all the land shall be consumed. 
ZEP.3.9	Because then I will make the speech of the nations pure;
ZEP.3.9	that all of them might call on the name of Yahweh, 
ZEP.3.9	to serve him in unison.
ZEP.3.10	From beyond the rivers of Cush 
ZEP.3.10	my worshipers and the daughter of my scattered ones 
ZEP.3.10	shall bring my offering. 
ZEP.3.11	On that day you shall not be humiliated 
ZEP.3.11	on account of all your deeds 
ZEP.3.11	by which you have rebelled against me. 
ZEP.3.11	For then I shall remove from your midst 
ZEP.3.11	those exulting in your pride, 
ZEP.3.11	and you shall no longer be haughty 
ZEP.3.11	in my holy mountain.
ZEP.3.12	And I will leave in your midst 
ZEP.3.12	a people afflicted and poor, 
ZEP.3.12	and they shall take refuge 
ZEP.3.12	in the name of Yahweh. 
ZEP.3.13	The remnant of Israel 
ZEP.3.13	shall not do wickedness; 
ZEP.3.13	they shall not speak deception, 
ZEP.3.13	nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth. 
ZEP.3.13	For they shall graze and lie down, 
ZEP.3.13	and none shall frighten them.” 
ZEP.3.14	Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion! 
ZEP.3.14	Cry aloud, O Israel! 
ZEP.3.14	Rejoice and be jubilant with all your heart, 
ZEP.3.14	O daughter of Jerusalem! 
ZEP.3.15	Yahweh has annulled your judgments; 
ZEP.3.15	he has turned away your enemies. 
ZEP.3.15	The king of Israel, Yahweh, is in your midst; 
ZEP.3.15	you shall no longer fear misfortune. 
ZEP.3.16	On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, 
ZEP.3.16	“Fear not, O Zion; 
ZEP.3.16	your hands shall not hang limp. 
ZEP.3.17	Yahweh your God is in your midst; 
ZEP.3.17	a mighty warrior who saves. 
ZEP.3.17	He shall rejoice over you with joy; 
ZEP.3.17	he renews
ZEP.3.17	he will exult over you with singing. 
ZEP.3.18	I will gather those of you grieving on account of the feast; 
ZEP.3.18	they were raising against her a reproach. 
ZEP.3.19	Behold, at that time I will deal with all your oppressors; 
ZEP.3.19	I will save the lame and gather the outcast. 
ZEP.3.19	I will change
ZEP.3.19	to glory and renown
ZEP.3.20	At that time I will bring you in; 
ZEP.3.20	at the time of my gathering you together. 
ZEP.3.20	For I will make you renowned
ZEP.3.20	among all the nations of the earth 
ZEP.3.20	when I restore your fortunes before your eyes,” 
ZEP.3.20	says Yahweh. 
HAG.1.1	In the second year of King Darius, in the sixth month, on the first day, the word of Yahweh came through
HAG.1.2	“Thus says Yahweh of hosts: ‘This people says, “The time has not come to rebuild the temple of Yahweh.’ ” 
HAG.1.3	And the word of Yahweh came through
HAG.1.4	“Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your houses that have been paneled while this house
HAG.1.5	And so then, thus says Yahweh of hosts: ‘Consider your ways!
HAG.1.6	You have sown much but have harvested little. You have eaten without being satisfied; you have drunk without being satiated;
HAG.1.7	Thus says Yahweh of hosts: ‘Consider your ways!
HAG.1.8	Go up the mountain and bring wood and build the house
HAG.1.9	‘You have looked for much, and look! It came to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why?’ declares
HAG.1.10	Therefore, because of you the heavens have withheld the dew and the earth has withheld its produce. 
HAG.1.11	I have called for a drought on the land and the hills,
HAG.1.12	Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people gave heed to the voice of Yahweh their God and to the words of Haggai the prophet, as Yahweh their God had sent him, and the people feared Yahweh.
HAG.1.13	And Haggai the messenger of Yahweh spoke to the people with the message of Yahweh, saying, “ ‘I am with you’ declares
HAG.1.14	And Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and did the work on the house of Yahweh of hosts, their God, 
HAG.1.15	on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of King Darius. 
HAG.2.1	In the seventh month on the twenty-first day, the word of Yahweh came through
HAG.2.2	“Speak now to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 
HAG.2.3	‘Who among you is left that saw this house in its former glory? And how do you see it now? Does it seem like nothing to you?
HAG.2.4	‘But now take courage,
HAG.2.5	‘according to the promise
HAG.2.6	For thus says Yahweh of hosts: ‘Once again, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and dry land. 
HAG.2.7	I will shake all the nations so that the treasure of all the nations will come, and I will fill this house
HAG.2.8	‘The silver is mine and the gold is mine,’ declares
HAG.2.9	‘The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,’ says Yahweh of hosts, ‘and in this place I will give peace’ declares
HAG.2.10	On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh came to the prophet Haggai, saying, 
HAG.2.11	“Thus says Yahweh of hosts: ‘Ask now the priests for a ruling:
HAG.2.12	If a man carries
HAG.2.13	Then Haggai said, “If one who is unclean from contact with a corpse touches any of these, will it become unclean?” The priests answered, “Yes, it will be become unclean.” 
HAG.2.14	And Haggai answered and said, “ ‘So it is with this people, and with this nation before me,’ declares
HAG.2.15	But now, please consider
HAG.2.16	from that time when
HAG.2.17	I struck you with blight, and with plant mildew, and hail, all the work of your hands. But you did not come back to me,’
HAG.2.18	‘Please consider
HAG.2.19	Is there still seed in the store chamber? Do the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree still produce nothing? From this day forward I will bless you.’ ” 
HAG.2.20	And the word of Yahweh came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month saying, 
HAG.2.21	“Say to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah: I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, 
HAG.2.22	and I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the military strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow chariots and their drivers; horses and their riders will fall, every one by the sword of another! 
HAG.2.23	‘On that day,’ declares
ZEC.1.1	 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh came
ZEC.1.2	“Yahweh was very angry with your ancestors.
ZEC.1.3	You must say to them: ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts: “Return to me,” declares
ZEC.1.4	“Do not be like your ancestors,
ZEC.1.5	“Your ancestors,
ZEC.1.6	However, did not my words and my regulations which I commanded my servants the prophets overtake your ancestors?
ZEC.1.7	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the prophet, son of Berekiah, son of Iddo, saying, 
ZEC.1.8	I had a vision in the night,
ZEC.1.9	And I asked, “What are these, my lord?” And the angel who was talking with me said, “I will show you what these are.” 
ZEC.1.10	And the man standing between the myrtle shrubs answered and said, “These are those whom Yahweh has sent to patrol
ZEC.1.11	And they answered the angel of Yahweh who was standing between the myrtle shrubs, and they said, “We have patrolled
ZEC.1.12	The angel of Yahweh answered and said, “O Yahweh of hosts, how long
ZEC.1.13	With gracious
ZEC.1.14	And the angel who was talking with me said to me, “Proclaim, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts: “I am very jealous
ZEC.1.15	And I am extremely angry
ZEC.1.16	Therefore, thus says Yahweh: “I have returned to Jerusalem with compassion. My temple
ZEC.1.17	Proclaim again, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts: “My cities shall again overflow from prosperity, and Yahweh will comfort Zion again, and he will choose Jerusalem again.” ’ ” 
ZEC.1.18	 And I looked up
ZEC.1.19	And I said to the angel who was talking with me, “What are these?” And he said to me, “These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.” 
ZEC.1.20	Then Yahweh showed me four skilled craftsmen, 
ZEC.1.21	and I asked, “What are these coming to do?” And he answered, saying, “These are the horns that scattered Judah, so that no man
ZEC.2.1	And I looked up
ZEC.2.2	And I asked, “Where are you going?” And he answered me, “To measure Jerusalem to see what is its width and what is its length.” 
ZEC.2.3	And look, the angel who was talking to me was coming forward, and another angel was coming forward to meet him. 
ZEC.2.4	And he said to him, “Run, say to that young man, ‘Jerusalem shall be inhabited like villages without walls
ZEC.2.5	And I will be for it a wall of fire all around,’ declares
ZEC.2.6	“Woe! Woe! Flee from the land of the north,” declares
ZEC.2.7	“Woe, Zion! Escape, you inhabitants of the daughter of Babylon!” 
ZEC.2.8	For thus said Yahweh of hosts, after glory
ZEC.2.9	“Yes, look! I am going to wave my hand against them, and they will become plunder for their servants, and you will know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me. 
ZEC.2.10	Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for look, I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,” declares
ZEC.2.11	“Many nations will join themselves to Yahweh on that day, and they will be my people, and I will dwell in your midst. And you will know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me to you. 
ZEC.2.12	And Yahweh will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land,
ZEC.2.13	Be silent, all people,
ZEC.3.1	And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before
ZEC.3.2	But Yahweh said to Satan,
ZEC.3.3	And Joshua was clothed in filthy garments and was standing before
ZEC.3.4	And he answered and said to the ones standing before
ZEC.3.5	And I said, “Let them put a clean headband
ZEC.3.6	And the angel of Yahweh assured Joshua, saying, 
ZEC.3.7	“Thus says Yahweh of hosts: ‘If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my requirements, then you will judge
ZEC.3.8	Listen, please, O Joshua the high priest, you and your companions
ZEC.3.9	For consider, the stone that I set before
ZEC.3.10	On that day,’ declares
ZEC.4.1	And the angel who was talking with me returned, and he wakened me as one who is wakened from his sleep. 
ZEC.4.2	And he said to me, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see, and look, a lampstand all of gold,
ZEC.4.3	And there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.” 
ZEC.4.4	And I answered and said to the angel who was talking to me, “What are these, my lord?” 
ZEC.4.5	And the angel who was talking with me answered and said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” And I said, “No, my lord.” 
ZEC.4.6	And he answered and said to me, “This is the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel, saying, ‘Not by strength and not by power, but only by my Spirit,’ says Yahweh of hosts. 
ZEC.4.7	‘Who are you O great mountain? Before
ZEC.4.8	And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

ZEC.10.6	and the house of Joseph I will save. 
ZEC.10.6	And I will bring them back, because I have compassion on them, 
ZEC.10.6	and they will be as if I had not rejected them,

ZEC.11.7	And I shepherded the flock
ZEC.11.8	And I got rid of three shepherds in one month, for I grew impatient
ZEC.11.9	So I said, “I will not shepherd you! The one dying will die, and the one to be destroyed will be destroyed. And the ones remaining, let them devour the flesh of each other.”
ZEC.11.10	And I took my staff Kindness and broke it, to break my covenant that I had made
ZEC.11.11	And it was broken on that day. Then the afflicted

MAT.1.9	and Uzziah became the father of Jotham, and Jotham became the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah, 
MAT.1.10	and Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh became the father of Amon,
MAT.1.11	and Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon. 
MAT.1.12	And after the deportation to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel,
MAT.1.13	and Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud, and Abiud became the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim became the father of Azor, 
MAT.1.14	and Azor became the father of Zadok, and Zadok became the father of Achim, and Achim became the father of Eliud, 
MAT.1.15	and Eliud became the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar became the father of Matthan, and Matthan became the father of Jacob, 
MAT.1.16	and Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary by whom
MAT.1.17	Therefore all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ are fourteen generations. 
MAT.1.18	Now the birth of Jesus Christ occurred in this way. His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant
MAT.1.19	So Joseph her husband, being righteous and not wanting to disgrace her, intended to divorce her secretly. 
MAT.1.20	But as
MAT.1.21	And she will give birth to a son, and you will call his name ‘Jesus,’ because he will save his people from their sins.” 
MAT.1.22	Now all this happened in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled, saying, 
MAT.1.23	“Behold, the virgin will become pregnant
MAT.1.23	and they will call his name Emmanuel,”
MAT.1.23	which is translated, “God with us.”
MAT.1.24	And Joseph, when he
MAT.1.25	and did not have sexual relations with
MAT.2.1	 Now after
MAT.2.2	saying, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star at its rising
MAT.2.3	And when
MAT.2.4	and after
MAT.2.5	So they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet, 
MAT.2.6	‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, 
MAT.2.6	are by no means least among the rulers of Judah, 
MAT.2.6	for from you will go out a ruler 
MAT.2.6	who will shepherd my people Israel.’ ”
MAT.2.7	Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and
MAT.2.8	And he sent them to Bethlehem and
MAT.2.9	After
MAT.2.10	Now when they
MAT.2.11	And when they
MAT.2.12	And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country by another route. 
MAT.2.13	Now after they had gone away, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him.” 
MAT.2.14	So he got up and
MAT.2.15	And he was there until the death of Herod, in order that what was said by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled, saying, 
MAT.2.15	“Out of Egypt I called my son.” 
MAT.2.16	Then Herod, when he
MAT.2.17	Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, saying, 
MAT.2.18	“A voice was heard in Ramah, 
MAT.2.18	weeping and great mourning, 
MAT.2.18	Rachel weeping for her children, 
MAT.2.18	and she did not want to be comforted, 
MAT.2.18	because they exist no longer
MAT.2.19	Now after
MAT.2.20	saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the life of the child are dead.” 
MAT.2.21	So he got up and
MAT.2.22	But when he
MAT.2.23	And he came and
MAT.3.1	 Now in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the Judean wilderness 
MAT.3.2	and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near!” 
MAT.3.3	For this is the one who was spoken about by the prophet Isaiah, saying, 
MAT.3.3	“The voice of one crying out in the wilderness, 
MAT.3.3	‘Prepare the way of the Lord, 
MAT.3.3	make his paths straight.’ ”
MAT.3.4	Now John himself had his clothing made from camel’s hair and a belt made of leather around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. 
MAT.3.5	Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the district around the Jordan were going out to him, 
MAT.3.6	and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River as they
MAT.3.7	But when he
MAT.3.8	Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance! 
MAT.3.9	And do not think to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones! 
MAT.3.10	Already now the ax is positioned at the root of the trees; therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 
MAT.3.11	I baptize you with water for repentance, but the one who comes after me is more powerful than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 
MAT.3.12	His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will clean out his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” 
MAT.3.13	Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John in order to be baptized by him. 
MAT.3.14	But John tried to prevent
MAT.3.15	But Jesus answered and
MAT.3.16	Now after he
MAT.3.17	And behold, there was
MAT.4.1	 Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil, 
MAT.4.2	and after he
MAT.4.3	And the tempter approached and
MAT.4.4	But he answered and
MAT.4.5	Then the devil took him to the holy city
MAT.4.6	and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down! For it is written, 
MAT.4.6	‘He will command his angels concerning you,’
MAT.4.6	and 
MAT.4.6	‘On their hands they will lift you up, 
MAT.4.6	lest you strike your foot against a stone.’ ”
MAT.4.7	Jesus said to him, “On the other hand it is written, ‘You are not to put the Lord your God to the test.’ ”
MAT.4.8	Again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, 
MAT.4.9	and he said to him, “I will give to you all these things, if you will fall down and
MAT.4.10	Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan, for it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’ ”
MAT.4.11	Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and began ministering to him. 
MAT.4.12	Now when he
MAT.4.13	And leaving Nazareth, he went and
MAT.4.14	in order that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said, 
MAT.4.15	“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, 
MAT.4.15	toward the sea,
MAT.4.15	Galilee of the Gentiles
MAT.4.16	the people who sit in darkness 
MAT.4.16	have seen a great light, 
MAT.4.16	and the ones who sit in the land and shadow of death, 
MAT.4.16	a light has dawned on them.”
MAT.4.17	From that time on, Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven is near.” 
MAT.4.18	Now as he
MAT.4.19	And he said to them, “Follow me
MAT.4.20	And immediately they left their nets and
MAT.4.21	And going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them. 
MAT.4.22	And immediately they left the boat and their father and
MAT.4.23	And he went around through all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. 
MAT.4.24	And a report about him went out throughout
MAT.4.25	And large crowds followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from the other side of the Jordan. 
MAT.5.1	 Now when he
MAT.5.2	And opening his mouth he began to teach them, saying, 
MAT.5.3	“Blessed are the poor in spirit, 
MAT.5.3	because theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.5.4	Blessed are the ones who mourn, 
MAT.5.4	because they will be comforted. 
MAT.5.5	Blessed are the meek, 
MAT.5.5	because they will inherit the earth. 
MAT.5.6	Blessed are the ones who hunger and thirst for righteousness, 
MAT.5.6	because they will be satisfied. 
MAT.5.7	Blessed are the merciful, 
MAT.5.7	because they will be shown mercy. 
MAT.5.8	Blessed are the pure in heart, 
MAT.5.8	because they will see God. 
MAT.5.9	Blessed are the peacemakers, 
MAT.5.9	because they will be called sons of God. 
MAT.5.10	Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, 
MAT.5.10	because theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.5.11	Blessed are you 
MAT.5.11	when they insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things against you, lying on account of me. 
MAT.5.12	Rejoice and be glad, because your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you. 
MAT.5.13	“You are the salt of the earth. But if salt becomes tasteless, by what will it be made salty? It is good for nothing any longer except to be thrown outside and
MAT.5.14	You are the light of the world. A city located on top of a hill cannot be hidden, 
MAT.5.15	nor do they light a lamp and place it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it shines on all those in the house. 
MAT.5.16	In the same way let your light shine before people, so that they can see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven. 
MAT.5.17	“Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy them but to fulfill them. 
MAT.5.18	For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one tiny letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all takes place. 
MAT.5.19	Therefore whoever abolishes one of the least of these commandments and teaches people to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever keeps them and teaches them, this person will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.5.20	For I say to you that unless your righteousness greatly surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.5.21	“You have heard that it was said to the people of old,
MAT.5.22	But I say to you that everyone who is angry at his brother will be subject to judgment, and whoever says to his brother, ‘Stupid fool!’
MAT.5.23	Therefore if you present your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, 
MAT.5.24	leave your gift there before the altar and first go be reconciled to your brother, and then come and
MAT.5.25	Settle the case quickly with your accuser
MAT.5.26	Truly I say to you, you will never come out of there until you have paid back the last penny! 
MAT.5.27	“You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’
MAT.5.28	But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 
MAT.5.29	And if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it from you! For it is better for you that one of your members be destroyed than your whole body be thrown into hell. 
MAT.5.30	And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it from you! For it is better for you that one of your limbs be destroyed than your whole body go into hell. 
MAT.5.31	“And it was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’
MAT.5.32	But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for a matter of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. 
MAT.5.33	“Again you have heard that it was said to the people of old,
MAT.5.34	But I say to you, do not swear at all, either by heaven, because it is the throne of God, 
MAT.5.35	or by the earth, because it is the footstool of his feet, or by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great king. 
MAT.5.36	And do not swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black. 
MAT.5.37	But let your statement be ‘Yes, yes; no, no,’ and anything beyond these is from the evil one.
MAT.5.38	“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’
MAT.5.39	But I say to you, do not resist the evildoer, but whoever strikes you on the right cheek,
MAT.5.40	And the one who wants to go to court with you and take your tunic, let him have
MAT.5.41	And whoever forces you to go one mile,
MAT.5.42	Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. 
MAT.5.43	“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor’
MAT.5.44	But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 
MAT.5.45	in order that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven, because he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust. 
MAT.5.46	For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not the tax collectors also do the same? 
MAT.5.47	And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing that is remarkable? Do not the Gentiles also do the same? 
MAT.5.48	Therefore you be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect. 
MAT.6.1	 “And take care not to practice your righteousness before people to be seen by them; otherwise
MAT.6.2	Therefore whenever you practice charitable giving, do not sound a trumpet in front of you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, in order that they may be praised by people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward in full! 
MAT.6.3	But you, when you
MAT.6.4	in order that your charitable giving may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. 
MAT.6.5	And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to stand and
MAT.6.6	But whenever you pray, enter into your inner room and shut your door and
MAT.6.7	“But when you
MAT.6.8	Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need
MAT.6.9	Therefore you pray in this way: 
MAT.6.9	“Our Father who is in heaven, 
MAT.6.9	may your name be treated as holy. 
MAT.6.10	May your kingdom come, 
MAT.6.10	may your will be done 
MAT.6.10	on earth as it is in heaven. 
MAT.6.11	Give us today our daily bread, 
MAT.6.12	and forgive us our debts, 
MAT.6.12	as we also have forgiven our debtors. 
MAT.6.13	And do not bring us into temptation, 
MAT.6.13	but deliver us from the evil one.
MAT.6.14	For if you forgive people their sins, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 
MAT.6.15	But if you do not forgive people, neither will your Father forgive your sins. 
MAT.6.16	“Whenever you fast, do not be sullen like the hypocrites, for they make their faces unrecognizable in order that they may be seen fasting by people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward in full! 
MAT.6.17	But when
MAT.6.18	so that you will not be seen by people as fasting, but to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. 
MAT.6.19	“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and consuming insect
MAT.6.20	but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor consuming insect
MAT.6.21	For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. 
MAT.6.22	“The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore if your eye is sincere, your whole body will be full of light. 
MAT.6.23	But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. Therefore if the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! 
MAT.6.24	“No one is able to serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You are not able to serve God and money.
MAT.6.25	“For this reason I say to you, do not be anxious for your life, what you will eat,
MAT.6.26	Consider the birds of the sky, that they do not sow or reap or gather produce into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are? 
MAT.6.27	And who among you, by
MAT.6.28	And why are you anxious about clothing? Observe the lilies of the field, how they grow: they do not toil or spin, 
MAT.6.29	but I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these. 
MAT.6.30	But if God dresses the grass of the field in this way, although it
MAT.6.31	Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?,’ 
MAT.6.32	for the pagans seek after all these things. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 
MAT.6.33	But seek first his kingdom and righteousness,
MAT.6.34	Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, because tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
MAT.7.1	 “Do not judge, so that you will not be judged. 
MAT.7.2	For by what judgment you judge, you will be judged, and by what measure you measure out, it will be measured out to you. 
MAT.7.3	And why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the beam of wood in your own eye? 
MAT.7.4	Or how will you say to your brother, ‘Allow me to remove the speck from your eye,’ and behold, the beam of wood is in your own eye? 
MAT.7.5	Hypocrite! First remove the beam of wood from your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye! 
MAT.7.6	“Do not give what is holy to dogs, or throw your pearls in front of pigs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn around and
MAT.7.7	“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened for you. 
MAT.7.8	For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. 
MAT.7.9	Or what man is there among you, if his son will ask him for bread, will give him a stone? 
MAT.7.10	Or also if he will ask for a fish, will give him a snake? 
MAT.7.11	Therefore if you, although you
MAT.7.12	Therefore in all things, whatever you want that people should do to you, thus also you do to them. For this is the law and the prophets. 
MAT.7.13	“Enter through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it, 
MAT.7.14	because narrow
MAT.7.15	“Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inside are ravenous wolves. 
MAT.7.16	You will recognize them by their fruits: they do not gather grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles, do they?
MAT.7.17	In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit. 
MAT.7.18	A good tree is not able to produce bad fruit, nor a bad tree to produce good fruit. 
MAT.7.19	Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 
MAT.7.20	As a result, you will recognize them by their fruits. 
MAT.7.21	“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 
MAT.7.22	On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many miracles in your name?’ 
MAT.7.23	And then I will say to them plainly,
MAT.7.24	“Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 
MAT.7.25	And the rain came down and the rivers came and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it did not collapse, because its foundation was laid on the rock. 
MAT.7.26	And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 
MAT.7.27	And the rain came down and the rivers came and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it collapsed, and its fall was great.” 
MAT.7.28	And it happened when Jesus finished these words the crowds were amazed at his teaching, 
MAT.7.29	because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like their scribes. 
MAT.8.1	 And when
MAT.8.2	And behold, a leper approached and
MAT.8.3	And extending his hand he touched him, saying, “I am willing, be clean.” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 
MAT.8.4	And Jesus said to him, “See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.” 
MAT.8.5	Now when
MAT.8.6	and saying, “Lord, my slave
MAT.8.7	And he said to him, “I will come and
MAT.8.8	And the centurion answered and
MAT.8.9	For I also am a man under authority who has soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another one, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it
MAT.8.10	Now when
MAT.8.11	But I say to you that many will come from east and west and be seated at the banquet
MAT.8.12	But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!” 
MAT.8.13	And Jesus said to the centurion, “Go, as you have believed it will be done for you.” And the slave
MAT.8.14	And when
MAT.8.15	And he touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve him. 
MAT.8.16	Now when it
MAT.8.17	in order that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said, 
MAT.8.17	“He himself took away our sicknesses, 
MAT.8.17	and carried away our diseases.”
MAT.8.18	Now when
MAT.8.19	And a scribe approached and
MAT.8.20	And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.” 
MAT.8.21	And another of the disciples
MAT.8.22	But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead!” 
MAT.8.23	And as
MAT.8.24	And behold, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being inundated by the waves, but he himself was asleep. 
MAT.8.25	And they came and
MAT.8.26	And he said to them, “Why are you fearful, you of little faith?” Then he got up and
MAT.8.27	And the men were astonished, saying, “What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?” 
MAT.8.28	And when
MAT.8.29	And behold, they cried out, saying, “What do you have to do with us,
MAT.8.30	Now a long way from them a large herd of pigs was feeding. 
MAT.8.31	So the demons implored him, saying, “If you are going to expel us, send us into the herd of pigs.” 
MAT.8.32	And he said to them, “Go!” So they departed and
MAT.8.33	Now the herdsmen fled and went into the town and
MAT.8.34	And behold, the whole town came out to meet Jesus, and when they
MAT.9.1	 And getting into a boat, he crossed over and came to his own town.
MAT.9.2	And behold, they brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher, and when
MAT.9.3	And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!” 
MAT.9.4	And knowing
MAT.9.5	For which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’? 
MAT.9.6	But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” then he said to the paralytic, “Get up, pick up your stretcher and go to your home.” 
MAT.9.7	And he got up and
MAT.9.8	But when
MAT.9.9	And as
MAT.9.10	And it happened as
MAT.9.11	And when they
MAT.9.12	And when he
MAT.9.13	But go and
MAT.9.14	Then the disciples of John
MAT.9.15	And Jesus said to them, “The bridegroom’s attendants
MAT.9.16	But no one puts a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment, for its patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear becomes worse. 
MAT.9.17	Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise
MAT.9.18	As
MAT.9.19	And Jesus and his disciples got up and
MAT.9.20	And behold, a woman who had been suffering with a hemorrhage twelve years approached from behind and
MAT.9.21	for she said to herself, “If only I touch his cloak I will be healed.” 
MAT.9.22	But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, “Have courage, daughter! Your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed from that hour. 
MAT.9.23	And when
MAT.9.24	he said, “Go away, because the girl is not dead, but is sleeping.” And they ridiculed him. 
MAT.9.25	But when the crowd had been sent out, he entered and
MAT.9.26	And this report went out into that whole region. 
MAT.9.27	And as
MAT.9.28	And when he
MAT.9.29	Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith let it be done for you.” 
MAT.9.30	And their eyes were opened, and Jesus sternly warned them, saying, “See that no one finds out.” 
MAT.9.31	But they went out and
MAT.9.32	Now as
MAT.9.33	And after
MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees were saying,
MAT.9.35	And Jesus was going around all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every
MAT.9.36	And when he
MAT.9.37	Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. 
MAT.9.38	Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest that he send out workers into his harvest.” 
MAT.10.1	 And summoning his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could expel them
MAT.10.2	Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, James
MAT.10.3	Philip, and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, 
MAT.10.4	Simon the Zealot,
MAT.10.5	Jesus sent out these twelve, instructing them saying, “Do not go on the road to the Gentiles, and do not enter into a city of the Samaritans, 
MAT.10.6	but go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
MAT.10.7	And as you
MAT.10.8	Heal those who are sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, expel demons. Freely you have received; freely give. 
MAT.10.9	Do not procure gold or silver or copper for your belts. 
MAT.10.10	Do not take a traveler’s bag for the road, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff, for the worker is deserving of his provisions. 
MAT.10.11	And into whatever town or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you depart. 
MAT.10.12	And when you
MAT.10.13	And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. 
MAT.10.14	And whoever does not welcome you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you
MAT.10.15	Truly I say to you, it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town! 
MAT.10.16	“Behold, I am sending you out like sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. 
MAT.10.17	But beware of people, because they will hand you over to councils, and they will flog you in their synagogues. 
MAT.10.18	And you will be brought before both governors and kings because of me, for a witness to them and to the Gentiles. 
MAT.10.19	But whenever they hand you over, do not be anxious how to speak
MAT.10.20	For you are not the ones who are speaking, but the Spirit of your Father who is speaking through you. 
MAT.10.21	“And brother will hand over brother to death, and a father his children, and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death, 
MAT.10.22	and you will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the one who endures to the end—this one will be saved. 
MAT.10.23	And whenever they persecute you in this town, flee to another, for truly I say to you, you will never finish going through the towns of Israel until the Son of Man comes. 
MAT.10.24	“A disciple is not superior to his teacher, nor a slave superior to his master. 
MAT.10.25	It is enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household? 
MAT.10.26	“Therefore do not be afraid of them, because nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not become known. 
MAT.10.27	What I say to you in the dark, tell in the light, and what you hear in your ear, proclaim on the housetops. 
MAT.10.28	And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul, but instead be afraid of the one who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 
MAT.10.29	Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
MAT.10.30	And even the hairs of your head are all numbered! 
MAT.10.31	Therefore do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. 
MAT.10.32	“Therefore everyone who acknowledges me before people, I also will acknowledge him before my Father who is in heaven. 
MAT.10.33	But whoever denies me before people, I also will deny him before my Father who is in heaven. 
MAT.10.34	“Do not think that I have come to bring peace on the earth! I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. 
MAT.10.35	For I have come to turn a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. 
MAT.10.36	And the enemies of a man will be the members of his household.
MAT.10.37	The one who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and the one who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 
MAT.10.38	And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 
MAT.10.39	The one who finds his life will lose it, and the one who loses his life because of me will find it. 
MAT.10.40	“The one who receives you receives me, and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me. 
MAT.10.41	The one who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and the one who receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward. 
MAT.10.42	And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he will never lose his reward.” 
MAT.11.1	 And it happened that when Jesus had finished giving orders to his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and to preach in their towns. 
MAT.11.2	Now when
MAT.11.3	and
MAT.11.4	And Jesus answered and
MAT.11.5	the blind receive sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and the poor have good news announced to them.
MAT.11.6	And whoever is not offended by me is blessed.” 
MAT.11.7	Now as
MAT.11.8	But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings. 
MAT.11.9	But why did you go out? To see a prophet?
MAT.11.10	It is this man about whom it is written: 
MAT.11.10	‘Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, 
MAT.11.10	who will prepare your way before you.’
MAT.11.11	Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist. But the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 
MAT.11.12	But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven is treated violently, and the violent claim
MAT.11.13	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John, 
MAT.11.14	and if you are willing to accept it,
MAT.11.15	The one who has ears, let him hear! 
MAT.11.16	“But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to one another, 
MAT.11.17	saying, 
MAT.11.17	‘We played the flute for you and you did not dance; 
MAT.11.17	we sang a lament and you did not mourn.’ 
MAT.11.18	For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’ 
MAT.11.19	The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a man who is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.”
MAT.11.20	Then he began to reproach the towns in which the majority of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent: 
MAT.11.21	“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 
MAT.11.22	Nevertheless I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and for Sidon on the day of judgment than for you! 
MAT.11.23	And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today. 
MAT.11.24	Nevertheless I tell you that it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you!” 
MAT.11.25	At that time Jesus answered and
MAT.11.26	Yes, Father, for to do so was your gracious will.
MAT.11.27	All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom
MAT.11.28	Come to me, all of you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest. 
MAT.11.29	Take my yoke on you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 
MAT.11.30	For my yoke is easy to carry and my burden is light.” 
MAT.12.1	 At that time Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath. And his disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck off heads of grain and eat them.
MAT.12.2	But when
MAT.12.3	So he said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those with him, 
MAT.12.4	how he entered into the house of God and ate the bread of the presentation, which it was not permitted for him or for those with him to eat, but only for the priests? 
MAT.12.5	Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the sanctity of the Sabbath and are guiltless? 
MAT.12.6	But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here! 
MAT.12.7	And if you had known what it means,
MAT.12.8	For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.” 
MAT.12.9	And going on from there he came into their synagogue. 
MAT.12.10	And behold, there was a man who had a withered hand, and they asked him, saying, “Is it permitted to heal on the Sabbath?” in order that they could accuse him. 
MAT.12.11	But he said to them, “What man will there be among you who will have one sheep and if this one fell into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it
MAT.12.12	Then to what degree is a man worth more than a sheep? So then, it is permitted to do good on the Sabbath.” 
MAT.12.13	Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand,” and he stretched it
MAT.12.14	But the Pharisees went out and plotted
MAT.12.15	Now Jesus, when he
MAT.12.16	And he warned them that they should not reveal his identity,
MAT.12.17	in order that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said, 
MAT.12.18	“Behold my servant whom I have chosen, 
MAT.12.18	my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased. 
MAT.12.18	I will put my Spirit on him, 
MAT.12.18	and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles. 
MAT.12.19	He will not quarrel or cry out, 
MAT.12.19	nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets. 
MAT.12.20	A crushed reed he will not break, 
MAT.12.20	and a smoldering wick he will not extinguish, 
MAT.12.20	until he brings justice to victory. 
MAT.12.21	And in his name the Gentiles
MAT.12.22	Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to him. And he healed him so that the man who was mute could speak and see. 
MAT.12.23	And all the crowds were amazed and began saying, “Perhaps this one is the Son of David!” 
MAT.12.24	But the Pharisees, when they
MAT.12.25	But knowing their thoughts, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. 
MAT.12.26	And if Satan expels Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? 
MAT.12.27	And if I expel demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons expel them?
MAT.12.28	But if I expel demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you! 
MAT.12.29	Or how can someone enter into the house of a strong man and steal his property, unless he first ties up the strong man? And then he can thoroughly plunder his house. 
MAT.12.30	The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters. 
MAT.12.31	For this reason I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven! 
MAT.12.32	And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him either in this age or in the coming one! 
MAT.12.33	“Either make the tree good and its fruit is good, or make the tree bad and its fruit is bad, for the tree is known by its fruit. 
MAT.12.34	Offspring of vipers! How are you able to say good things when you
MAT.12.35	The good person from his
MAT.12.36	But I tell you that every worthless word that they speak, people will give an account for it on the day of judgment! 
MAT.12.37	For by your words you will be vindicated, and by your words you will be condemned.” 
MAT.12.38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him saying, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you!” 
MAT.12.39	But he answered and
MAT.12.40	For just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. 
MAT.12.41	The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah, and behold, something
MAT.12.42	The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something
MAT.12.43	“Now whenever an unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it travels through waterless places searching for rest, and does not find it.
MAT.12.44	Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came out.’ And when it
MAT.12.45	Then it goes and brings along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and
MAT.12.46	And
MAT.12.47	And someone told him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers are standing there outside desiring to speak to you.” 
MAT.12.48	But he answered and
MAT.12.49	And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, “Behold my mother and my brothers! 
MAT.12.50	For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother.” 
MAT.13.1	 On that day Jesus went out of the house and
MAT.13.2	And large crowds gathered close around him, so that he got into a boat to sit down, and all the crowd was standing on the shore. 
MAT.13.3	And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, “Behold, the sower went out to sow, 
MAT.13.4	and while he was sowing, some seed
MAT.13.5	And other seed fell on the rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up at once because it did not have any depth of soil. 
MAT.13.6	But when
MAT.13.7	And other seed fell among the thorn plants, and the thorn plants came up and choked it. 
MAT.13.8	But other seed fell on the good soil and produced grain,
MAT.13.9	The one who has ears, let him hear!” 
MAT.13.10	And the disciples came up and
MAT.13.11	And he answered and
MAT.13.12	For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. 
MAT.13.13	For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand, 
MAT.13.14	and with reference to them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says, 
MAT.13.14	“You will listen carefully
MAT.13.14	and you will look closely
MAT.13.15	For the heart of this people has become dull, 
MAT.13.15	and with their ears they hear with difficulty, 
MAT.13.15	and they have shut their eyes, 
MAT.13.15	so that they would not see with their eyes 
MAT.13.15	and hear with their ears 
MAT.13.15	and understand with their heart 
MAT.13.15	and turn, and I would heal them.”
MAT.13.16	But your eyes are blessed because they see, and your ears because they hear. 
MAT.13.17	For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it,
MAT.13.18	“You, therefore, listen to the parable of the sower: 
MAT.13.19	When
MAT.13.20	And what was sown on the rocky ground—this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy. 
MAT.13.21	But he does not have a root in himself, but lasts only a little while,
MAT.13.22	And what was sown into the thorn plants—this is the one who hears the word, and the anxiety of this world
MAT.13.23	But what was sown on the good soil—this is the one who hears the word and understands it,
MAT.13.24	He put before them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field. 
MAT.13.25	But while his
MAT.13.26	So when the wheat
MAT.13.27	So the slaves of the master of the house came and
MAT.13.28	And he said to them, ‘An enemy has done this!’ So the slaves said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and
MAT.13.29	But he said, “No, lest when you
MAT.13.30	Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the season of the harvest I will tell the reapers, “First gather the darnel and tie it into bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my storehouse.” ’ ” 
MAT.13.31	He put before them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and
MAT.13.32	It
MAT.13.33	He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and
MAT.13.34	Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables, and he was saying nothing to them without a parable, 
MAT.13.35	in order that what was spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled, who said, 
MAT.13.35	“I will open my mouth in parables; 
MAT.13.35	I will proclaim what has been hidden since the creation.”
MAT.13.36	Then he left the crowds and
MAT.13.37	So he answered and
MAT.13.38	and the field is the world. And the good seed—these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil one. 
MAT.13.39	And the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. 
MAT.13.40	Thus just as the darnel is gathered and burned
MAT.13.41	The Son of Man will send out his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all the causes of sin and those who do lawless deeds, 
MAT.13.42	and throw them into the fiery furnace.
MAT.13.43	Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.
MAT.13.44	“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, that a man found and
MAT.13.45	“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls. 
MAT.13.46	And when he
MAT.13.47	“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish
MAT.13.48	which when it was filled they pulled to shore and sat down and
MAT.13.49	Thus it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go out and separate the evil from among the righteous 
MAT.13.50	and throw them into the fiery furnace.
MAT.13.51	“Have you understood all these things?” They said to him, “Yes.” 
MAT.13.52	And he said to them, “For this reason every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of the house who brings out of his storeroom new things and old things.” 
MAT.13.53	And it happened that when Jesus had finished these parables he went away from there. 
MAT.13.54	And he came to his hometown and
MAT.13.55	Is not this one the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? 
MAT.13.56	And are not all his sisters with us? From where then did this man get all these things?” 
MAT.13.57	And they were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own hometown and in his own household.” 
MAT.13.58	And he did not perform many miracles in that place because of their unbelief. 
MAT.14.1	 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus 
MAT.14.2	and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist! He has been raised from the dead, and for this reason miraculous powers are at work in him.” 
MAT.14.3	For Herod, after
MAT.14.4	because John had been saying to him, “It is not permitted for you to have her.” 
MAT.14.5	And although he
MAT.14.6	But when
MAT.14.7	Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. 
MAT.14.8	And coached by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter!” 
MAT.14.9	And although
MAT.14.10	And he sent orders
MAT.14.11	and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it
MAT.14.12	And his disciples came and
MAT.14.13	Now when
MAT.14.14	And as he
MAT.14.15	Now when it
MAT.14.16	But Jesus said to them, “They do not need
MAT.14.17	And they said to him, “We do not have anything
MAT.14.18	So he said, “Bring them here to me.” 
MAT.14.19	And he commanded the crowds to recline for a meal on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and
MAT.14.20	And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full. 
MAT.14.21	Now those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children. 
MAT.14.22	And immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent away the crowds. 
MAT.14.23	And after he
MAT.14.24	But the boat was already many stadia distant from the land, being beaten by the waves, because the wind was against it. 
MAT.14.25	And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. 
MAT.14.26	But the disciples, when they
MAT.14.27	But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Have courage, I am he! Do not be afraid!” 
MAT.14.28	And Peter answered him and
MAT.14.29	So he said, “Come!” And getting out of the boat, Peter walked on the water and came toward Jesus. 
MAT.14.30	But when he
MAT.14.31	And immediately Jesus extended his
MAT.14.32	And when
MAT.14.33	So those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God!” 
MAT.14.34	And after they
MAT.14.35	And when
MAT.14.36	And they were imploring him that they might only touch the edge
MAT.15.1	 Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying, 
MAT.15.2	“Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat a meal.”
MAT.15.3	So he answered and
MAT.15.4	For God said, ‘Honor your
MAT.15.5	But you say, ‘Whoever says to his
MAT.15.6	need not honor his father,’
MAT.15.7	Hypocrites! Isaiah correctly prophesied about you saying, 
MAT.15.8	‘This people honors me with their
MAT.15.8	but their heart is far, far away from me, 
MAT.15.9	and they worship me in vain, 
MAT.15.9	teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’ ”
MAT.15.10	And summoning the crowd, he said to them, “Hear and understand: 
MAT.15.11	It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth—this defiles a person.” 
MAT.15.12	Then the disciples came and
MAT.15.13	And he answered and
MAT.15.14	Let
MAT.15.15	But Peter answered and
MAT.15.16	But he said, “Are you also still without understanding? 
MAT.15.17	Do you not understand that everything that enters into the mouth goes into the stomach and is evacuated into the latrine? 
MAT.15.18	But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these defile the person. 
MAT.15.19	For from the heart come evil plans, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, abusive speech. 
MAT.15.20	These are the things that defile a person. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person!” 
MAT.15.21	And departing from there, Jesus went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 
MAT.15.22	And behold, a Canaanite woman from that district came and cried out, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!” 
MAT.15.23	But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came up and
MAT.15.24	But he answered and
MAT.15.25	But she came and
MAT.15.26	And he answered and
MAT.15.27	So she said, “Yes, Lord, for even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.” 
MAT.15.28	Then Jesus answered and said to her, “O woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you want.” And her daughter was healed from that hour. 
MAT.15.29	And departing from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee, and he went up on the mountain and
MAT.15.30	And large crowds came to him, having with them the mute, blind, lame, crippled,
MAT.15.31	So then the crowd was astonished when they
MAT.15.32	And Jesus summoned his disciples and
MAT.15.33	And the disciples said to him, “Where in this desolate place can we get
MAT.15.34	And Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” So they said, “Seven, and a few little fish.” 
MAT.15.35	And commanding the crowd to recline for a meal on the ground, 
MAT.15.36	he took the seven loaves and the fish and after he
MAT.15.37	And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full. 
MAT.15.38	Now those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children. 
MAT.15.39	And after he
MAT.16.1	 And when
MAT.16.2	So he answered and
MAT.16.3	and early in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy weather, because the sky is red and
MAT.16.4	An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, and a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah!” And he left them and
MAT.16.5	And when
MAT.16.6	And Jesus said to them, “Watch out for and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!” 
MAT.16.7	So they were discussing this
MAT.16.8	But knowing this,
MAT.16.9	Do you not yet understand or do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up? 
MAT.16.10	Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you took up? 
MAT.16.11	How do you not understand that I did not speak to you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!” 
MAT.16.12	Then they understood that he did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 
MAT.16.13	Now when
MAT.16.14	And they said, Some
MAT.16.15	He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” 
MAT.16.16	And Simon Peter answered and
MAT.16.17	And Jesus answered and
MAT.16.18	And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it! 
MAT.16.19	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound
MAT.16.20	Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was the Christ. 
MAT.16.21	From that time on Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day. 
MAT.16.22	And Peter took him aside and
MAT.16.23	But he turned around and
MAT.16.24	Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. 
MAT.16.25	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of me will find it. 
MAT.16.26	For what will a person be benefited if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? Or what will a person give in exchange for his life? 
MAT.16.27	For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and at that time he will reward each one according to what he has done.
MAT.16.28	Truly I say to you, that there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.” 
MAT.17.1	 And after six days Jesus took along Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves. 
MAT.17.2	And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothing became bright as the light. 
MAT.17.3	And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him. 
MAT.17.4	So Peter answered and
MAT.17.5	While
MAT.17.6	And when
MAT.17.7	And Jesus came and touched them and
MAT.17.8	And when they
MAT.17.9	And as
MAT.17.10	And the disciples asked him, saying, “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” 
MAT.17.11	And he answered and
MAT.17.12	But I say to you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did with him whatever they wanted. In the same way also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.” 
MAT.17.13	Then the disciples understood that he had spoken to them about John the Baptist. 
MAT.17.14	And when they
MAT.17.15	and saying, “Lord, have mercy on my son, because he has seizures and suffers severely, for often he falls into the fire and often into the water. 
MAT.17.16	And I brought him to your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.” 
MAT.17.17	And Jesus answered and
MAT.17.18	And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him and the boy was healed from that hour. 
MAT.17.19	Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and
MAT.17.20	And he said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly I say to you, if you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.”
MAT.17.22	Now as
MAT.17.23	and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised.” And they were extremely distressed. 
MAT.17.24	Now when
MAT.17.25	He said, “Yes.” And when he
MAT.17.26	And when he
MAT.17.27	But so that we do not give offense to them, go out to the sea, cast a line with
MAT.18.1	 At that time the disciples came up to Jesus, saying, “Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” 
MAT.18.2	And calling a child to himself, he had him stand in their midst 
MAT.18.3	and said, “Truly I say to you, unless you turn around and become like young children, you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven! 
MAT.18.4	Therefore whoever humbles himself like this child, this person is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, 
MAT.18.5	and whoever welcomes one child such as this in my name welcomes me. 
MAT.18.6	But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him that a large millstone
MAT.18.7	Woe to the world because of causes for stumbling, for it is a necessity that causes for stumbling come; nevertheless, woe to the person through whom the cause for stumbling comes. 
MAT.18.8	And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it
MAT.18.9	And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it
MAT.18.10	“See to it that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven constantly see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
MAT.18.12	What do you think? If a certain man has
MAT.18.13	And if he happens to find it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not wander away. 
MAT.18.14	In the same way it is not the will of
MAT.18.15	“Now if your brother sins against you, go correct him between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. 
MAT.18.16	But if he does not listen, take with you in addition one or two others, so that by the testimony
MAT.18.17	And if he refuses to listen to them, tell it
MAT.18.18	“Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven. 
MAT.18.19	Again, truly I say to you that if two of you agree on earth about any matter that they ask, it will be done for them from my Father who is in heaven. 
MAT.18.20	For where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there in the midst of them.” 
MAT.18.21	Then Peter came up to him and
MAT.18.22	Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven!
MAT.18.23	“For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man—a king—who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves. 
MAT.18.24	And when
MAT.18.25	And because
MAT.18.26	Then the slave threw himself to the ground and
MAT.18.27	So the master of that slave, because he
MAT.18.28	But that slave went out and
MAT.18.29	Then his fellow slave threw himself to the ground and
MAT.18.30	But he did not want to, but rather he went and
MAT.18.31	So when
MAT.18.32	Then his master summoned him and
MAT.18.33	Should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave as I also showed mercy to you?’ 
MAT.18.34	And because he
MAT.18.35	So also my heavenly Father will do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from your hearts!” 
MAT.19.1	 And it happened that when Jesus had finished these statements, he went away from Galilee and came into the region of Judea on the other side of the Jordan. 
MAT.19.2	And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. 
MAT.19.3	And Pharisees came up to him in order to
MAT.19.4	And he answered and
MAT.19.5	and said, ‘On account of this a man will leave his
MAT.19.6	So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, man must not separate.” 
MAT.19.7	They said to him, “Why then did Moses command us
MAT.19.8	He said to them, “Moses, with reference to your hardness of heart, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not like this. 
MAT.19.9	Now I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the basis of sexual immorality, and marries another commits adultery, and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery.”
MAT.19.10	The disciples
MAT.19.11	But he said to them, “Not everyone can accept this saying but those to whom it has been given. 
MAT.19.12	For there are eunuchs who were born as such from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by people, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs
MAT.19.13	Then children were brought to him so that he could lay his
MAT.19.14	But Jesus said, “Allow the children, and do not forbid them to come to me, for to such belongs
MAT.19.15	And he laid his
MAT.19.16	And behold, someone came up to him and
MAT.19.17	And he said to him, “Why are you asking me about what is good? There is one who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments!” 
MAT.19.18	He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “Do not commit murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, 
MAT.19.19	honor your
MAT.19.20	The young man said to him, “All these I have observed. What do I still lack?” 
MAT.19.21	Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give the proceeds
MAT.19.22	But when
MAT.19.23	And Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I say to you that with difficulty a rich person will enter into the kingdom of heaven! 
MAT.19.24	And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich person into
MAT.19.25	So when
MAT.19.26	But Jesus looked at them
MAT.19.27	Then Peter answered and
MAT.19.28	And Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that in the renewal of the world,
MAT.19.29	And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife
MAT.19.30	But many who are first will be last, and the last first. 
MAT.20.1	 “For the kingdom of heaven is like a man—the master of the house—who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. 
MAT.20.2	And after
MAT.20.3	And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace. 
MAT.20.4	And to those people he said, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and I will give you whatever is right.’ 
MAT.20.5	So they went. Going out
MAT.20.6	And about the eleventh hour he went out and
MAT.20.7	They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go also into the vineyard.’ 
MAT.20.8	And when
MAT.20.9	And when the ones hired about the eleventh hour came, they received a denarius apiece. 
MAT.20.10	And when
MAT.20.11	And when they
MAT.20.12	saying, ‘These last people worked one hour and you made them equal to us who have endured the burden of the day and the burning heat!’ 
MAT.20.13	But he answered one of them and
MAT.20.14	Take what is yours and go! But I want to give to this last person the same as I gave
MAT.20.15	Is it not
MAT.20.16	Thus the last will be first and the first last.” 
MAT.20.17	And as
MAT.20.18	“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, 
MAT.20.19	and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock him
MAT.20.20	Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons, and
MAT.20.21	And he said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Say that these two sons of mine may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your kingdom.” 
MAT.20.22	But Jesus answered and
MAT.20.23	He said to them, “You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine
MAT.20.24	And when
MAT.20.25	But Jesus called them to himself and
MAT.20.26	It will not be like this among you! But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 
MAT.20.27	and whoever wants to be most prominent among you must be your slave—
MAT.20.28	just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” 
MAT.20.29	And as
MAT.20.30	And behold, there were two blind men sitting beside the road. When they
MAT.20.31	And the crowd rebuked them so that they would be quiet. But they called out all the more, saying, “Lord, have mercy on us,
MAT.20.32	And Jesus stopped,
MAT.20.33	They said to him, “Lord, that our eyes be opened!” 
MAT.20.34	And having compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed him. 
MAT.21.1	 And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, 
MAT.21.2	saying to them, “Go into the village before you, and right away you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her. Untie them
MAT.21.3	And if anyone says anything to you, you will say, ‘The Lord needs them,’
MAT.21.4	Now this took place so that what was spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled, saying, 
MAT.21.5	“Say to the daughter of Zion, 
MAT.21.5	‘Behold, your king is coming to you, 
MAT.21.5	humble and mounted on a donkey, 
MAT.21.5	and
MAT.21.6	So the disciples went
MAT.21.7	and
MAT.21.8	And a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them
MAT.21.9	And the crowds who went ahead of him and the ones who followed were shouting, saying, 
MAT.21.9	“Hosanna to the Son of David! 
MAT.21.9	Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!
MAT.21.9	Hosanna in the highest heaven!”
MAT.21.10	And when
MAT.21.11	And the crowds were saying, “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee!” 
MAT.21.12	And Jesus entered the temple courts
MAT.21.13	And he said to them, “It is written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’
MAT.21.14	And the blind and the lame came up to him in the temple courts
MAT.21.15	But when
MAT.21.16	And they said to him, “Do you hear what these children
MAT.21.17	And leaving them, he went outside of the city to Bethany and spent the night there. 
MAT.21.18	Now early in the morning, as he
MAT.21.19	And seeing a single fig tree by the road, he went to it and found nothing on it except leaves only. And he said to it, “May there be no more fruit from you forever,
MAT.21.20	And when they
MAT.21.21	And Jesus answered and
MAT.21.22	And whatever you ask in prayer, if you
MAT.21.23	And after
MAT.21.24	And Jesus answered and
MAT.21.25	From where was the baptism of John—from heaven or from men?” And they began to discuss
MAT.21.26	But if we say, ‘From men,’ we are afraid of the crowd, because they all look upon John as a prophet.” 
MAT.21.27	And they answered and
MAT.21.28	“Now what do you think? A man had two sons. He approached
MAT.21.29	And he answered and
MAT.21.30	And he approached the second
MAT.21.31	Which of the two did the will of his
MAT.21.32	For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did believe him. And when
MAT.21.33	“Listen to another parable: There was a man—a master of a house—who planted a vineyard, and put a fence around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower, and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey. 
MAT.21.34	And when the season of fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the tenant farmers to collect his fruit. 
MAT.21.35	And the tenant farmers seized his slaves, one of whom they beat, and one of whom they killed, and one of whom they stoned. 
MAT.21.36	Again, he sent other slaves, more than the first ones, and they did the same thing to them. 
MAT.21.37	So finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ 
MAT.21.38	But when
MAT.21.39	And they seized him and
MAT.21.40	Now when the master of the vineyard arrives, what will he do to those tenant farmers?” 
MAT.21.41	They said to him, “He will destroy those evil men completely and lease the vineyard to other tenant farmers who will give him the fruits in their season.” 
MAT.21.42	Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the scriptures, 
MAT.21.42	‘The stone which the builders rejected, 
MAT.21.42	this has become the cornerstone.
MAT.21.42	This came about from the Lord, 
MAT.21.42	and it is marvelous in our eyes’?
MAT.21.43	For this reason, I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a people
MAT.21.44	And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls—it will crush him!” 
MAT.21.45	And when
MAT.21.46	and although they
MAT.22.1	 And continuing, Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying, 
MAT.22.2	“The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man—a king—who gave a wedding celebration for his son. 
MAT.22.3	And he sent his slaves to summon those who had been invited to the wedding celebration, and they did not want to come. 
MAT.22.4	Again he sent other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding celebration!” ’ 
MAT.22.5	But they paid no attention and
MAT.22.6	And the others, seizing his slaves, mistreated them
MAT.22.7	And the king was angry and sent his troops and
MAT.22.8	Then he said to his slaves, ‘The wedding celebration is ready, but those who had been invited were not worthy. 
MAT.22.9	Therefore, go out to the places where the roads exit the city and invite to the wedding celebration as many people as you find.’ 
MAT.22.10	And those slaves went out into the roads and
MAT.22.11	But when
MAT.22.12	And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here, not having wedding clothes?’ But he could say nothing.
MAT.22.13	Then the king said to the servants, ‘Tie him up hand and foot
MAT.22.14	For many are called but few are chosen.” 
MAT.22.15	Then the Pharisees went and consulted
MAT.22.16	And they sent their disciples to him with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not care what anyone thinks,
MAT.22.17	Therefore tell us what you think. Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” 
MAT.22.18	But because he
MAT.22.19	Show me the coin for the tax!” So they brought him a denarius. 
MAT.22.20	And he said to them, “Whose image and inscription is this?” 
MAT.22.21	They said to him, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!” 
MAT.22.22	And when they
MAT.22.23	On that day Sadducees—who say there is no resurrection—came up to him and asked him, 
MAT.22.24	saying, “Teacher, Moses said if someone dies without having children, his brother is to marry his wife and father
MAT.22.25	Now there were seven brothers with us. And the first died after
MAT.22.26	So also the second and the third, up to the seventh. 
MAT.22.27	And last of all the woman died. 
MAT.22.28	In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her as wife.”
MAT.22.29	But Jesus answered and
MAT.22.30	For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God
MAT.22.31	Now concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, who said, 
MAT.22.32	“I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob”?
MAT.22.33	And when
MAT.22.34	Now when
MAT.22.35	And one of them, a legal expert, put a question to him
MAT.22.36	“Teacher, which commandment is greatest in the law?” 
MAT.22.37	And he said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’
MAT.22.38	This is the greatest and first commandment. 
MAT.22.39	And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’
MAT.22.40	On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.” 
MAT.22.41	Now while
MAT.22.42	saying, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “David’s.” 
MAT.22.43	He said to them, “How then does David, by the Spirit, call him ‘Lord,’ saying, 
MAT.22.44	‘The Lord said to my Lord, 
MAT.22.44	“Sit at my right hand 
MAT.22.44	until I put your enemies 
MAT.22.44	under your feet” ’?
MAT.22.45	If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how is he his son?” 
MAT.22.46	And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask him any more questions.
MAT.23.1	 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples, 
MAT.23.2	saying, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on the seat of Moses. 
MAT.23.3	Therefore do and observe everything that they tell you, but do not do as they do,
MAT.23.4	And they tie up heavy burdens
MAT.23.5	And they do all their deeds in order to be seen by people, for they make their phylacteries broad and make their
MAT.23.6	And they love the place of honor at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues 
MAT.23.7	and the greetings in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by people. 
MAT.23.8	But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ because one is your teacher, and you are all brothers, 
MAT.23.9	And do not call anyone
MAT.23.10	And do not be called teachers, because one is your teacher, the Christ. 
MAT.23.11	And the greatest among you will be your servant. 
MAT.23.12	And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. 
MAT.23.13	“But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you shut the kingdom of heaven before people! For you do not enter, nor permit those wanting to go in
MAT.23.15	“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you travel around the sea and the dry land to make one convert, and when he becomes one,
MAT.23.16	“Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing! But whoever swears by the gold of the temple is bound by his oath.’
MAT.23.17	Fools and blind people! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy? 
MAT.23.18	And, ‘Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing! But whoever swears by the gift that is on it is bound by his oath.’
MAT.23.19	Blind people! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy? 
MAT.23.20	Therefore the one who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything that is on it. 
MAT.23.21	And the one who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it. 
MAT.23.22	And the one who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by the one who sits on it. 
MAT.23.23	“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you pay a tenth of mint and dill and cumin, and neglect the more important matters of the law—justice and mercy and faithfulness! It was necessary
MAT.23.24	Blind guides who filter out a gnat and swallow a camel! 
MAT.23.25	“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence! 
MAT.23.26	Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish,
MAT.23.27	“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and of everything unclean! 
MAT.23.28	In the same way, on the outside you also appear righteous to people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. 
MAT.23.29	“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous, 
MAT.23.30	and you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in the blood of the prophets!’ 
MAT.23.31	Thus you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets! 
MAT.23.32	And you—fill up the measure of your fathers! 
MAT.23.33	Serpents! Offspring of vipers! How will you escape from the condemnation to hell? 
MAT.23.34	For this reason, behold, I am sending to you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and will pursue from town to town, 
MAT.23.35	so that upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on the earth from the blood of righteous Abel up to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. 
MAT.23.36	Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation! 
MAT.23.37	“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How many times I wanted to gather your children together the way
MAT.23.38	Behold, your house has been left to you desolate! 
MAT.23.39	For I tell you, you will never see me from now on until you say, 
MAT.23.39	‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!’ ”
MAT.24.1	 And as Jesus went out of the temple courts
MAT.24.2	But he answered and
MAT.24.3	And as
MAT.24.4	And Jesus answered and
MAT.24.5	For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will deceive many. 
MAT.24.6	And you are going to hear about wars and rumors of wars. See to it that you are not alarmed, for this must happen, but the end is not yet. 
MAT.24.7	For nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
MAT.24.8	But all these things are the beginning of birth pains. 
MAT.24.9	“Then they will hand you over to persecution and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations
MAT.24.10	And then many will be led into sin and will betray one another and will hate one another, 
MAT.24.11	and many false prophets will appear and will deceive many, 
MAT.24.12	and because lawlessness will increase, the love of many will grow cold. 
MAT.24.13	But the one who endures to the end—this person will be saved. 
MAT.24.14	And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations,
MAT.24.15	“So when you see the abomination of desolation
MAT.24.16	“then those in Judea must flee to the mountains! 
MAT.24.17	The one who is on his
MAT.24.18	and the one who is in the field must not turn back to pick up his cloak. 
MAT.24.19	And woe to those who are pregnant
MAT.24.20	But pray that your flight may not happen in winter or on a Sabbath. 
MAT.24.21	For at that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not happened from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will happen. 
MAT.24.22	And unless those days had been shortened, no human being would be saved.
MAT.24.23	“At that time if anyone should say to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or ‘Here he is,’ do not believe him!
MAT.24.24	For false messiahs and false prophets will appear, and will produce great signs and wonders in order to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 
MAT.24.25	Behold, I have told you ahead of time! 
MAT.24.26	Therefore if they say to you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out, or
MAT.24.27	For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so the coming of the Son of Man will be. 
MAT.24.28	Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather. 
MAT.24.29	“And immediately after the tribulation of those days, 
MAT.24.29	‘the sun will be darkened 
MAT.24.29	and the moon will not give its light, 
MAT.24.29	and the stars will fall from heaven, 
MAT.24.29	and the powers of heaven will be shaken.’
MAT.24.30	And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven,
MAT.24.31	And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect together from the four winds, from one end of heaven
MAT.24.32	“Now learn the parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch has already become tender and puts forth its
MAT.24.33	So also you, when you see all these things, know
MAT.24.34	Truly I say to you that this generation will never pass away until all these things take place! 
MAT.24.35	Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. 
MAT.24.36	“But concerning that day and hour no one knows—not even the angels of heaven nor the Son—except the Father alone. 
MAT.24.37	For just as the days of Noah were, so the coming of the Son of Man will be. 
MAT.24.38	For as in the days
MAT.24.39	And they did not know anything
MAT.24.40	Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one left. 
MAT.24.41	Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left. 
MAT.24.42	Therefore be on the alert, because you do not know what day your Lord is coming! 
MAT.24.43	But understand this: that if the master of the house had known what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. 
MAT.24.44	For this reason you also must be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think he will come.
MAT.24.45	“Who then is the faithful and wise slave whom the master has put in charge of his household slaves to give them their
MAT.24.46	Blessed is that slave whom his master will find so doing when he
MAT.24.47	Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions. 
MAT.24.48	But if that evil slave should say to himself,
MAT.24.49	and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with drunkards, 
MAT.24.50	the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know, 
MAT.24.51	and will cut him in two and assign his place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth! 
MAT.25.1	 “Then the kingdom of heaven may be compared to ten virgins who took their lamps and
MAT.25.2	Now five of them were foolish and five were wise. 
MAT.25.3	For when
MAT.25.4	But the wise ones took olive oil in flasks with their lamps. 
MAT.25.5	And when
MAT.25.6	But in the middle of the night there was a shout, ‘Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’ 
MAT.25.7	Then all those virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. 
MAT.25.8	And the foolish ones said to the wise ones, ‘Give us some of your olive oil, because our lamps are going out!’ 
MAT.25.9	But the wise ones answered saying, “Certainly there will never be enough for us and for you! Go instead to those who sell olive oil
MAT.25.10	But while
MAT.25.11	And later the other virgins came also, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open the door
MAT.25.12	But he answered and
MAT.25.13	Therefore be on the alert, because you do not know the day or the hour! 
MAT.25.14	For it is like a man going on a journey. He summoned his own slaves and handed over his property to them. 
MAT.25.15	And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each one according to his own ability, and he went on a journey immediately. 
MAT.25.16	The one who had received the five talents went out and
MAT.25.17	In the same way the one who had the two gained two more. 
MAT.25.18	But the one who had received the one went away and
MAT.25.19	Now after a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them. 
MAT.25.20	And the one who had received the five talents came up and
MAT.25.21	His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things; I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’ 
MAT.25.22	And the one who had the two talents also came up and
MAT.25.23	His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things; I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’ 
MAT.25.24	And the one who had received the one talent came up also and
MAT.25.25	And because I
MAT.25.26	But his master answered and
MAT.25.27	Then you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and when I
MAT.25.28	Therefore take the talent from him and give it
MAT.25.29	For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. 
MAT.25.30	And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness—in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!’ 
MAT.25.31	Now when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. 
MAT.25.32	And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them from one another like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 
MAT.25.33	And he will place the sheep on his right and the goats on the left. 
MAT.25.34	Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world! 
MAT.25.35	For I was hungry and you gave me something
MAT.25.36	I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you cared for me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ 
MAT.25.37	Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you,
MAT.25.38	And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you
MAT.25.39	And when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?’ 
MAT.25.40	And the king will answer and
MAT.25.41	Then he will also say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you accursed ones, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels! 
MAT.25.42	For I was hungry and you did not give me anything
MAT.25.43	I was a stranger and you did not welcome me as a guest, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not care for me.’ 
MAT.25.44	Then they will also answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and not serve you?’ 
MAT.25.45	Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly I say to you, in as much as you did not do it
MAT.25.46	And these will depart into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.” 
MAT.26.1	 And it happened that when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, 
MAT.26.2	“You know that after two days the Passover takes place, and the Son of Man will be handed over
MAT.26.3	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas, 
MAT.26.4	and plotted in order that they could arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.
MAT.26.5	But they were saying, “Not during the feast, so that there will not be an uproar among the people.” 
MAT.26.6	Now while
MAT.26.7	a woman came up to him holding an alabaster flask of very expensive perfumed oil, and poured it
MAT.26.8	And when
MAT.26.9	For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor!” 
MAT.26.10	But Jesus, knowing this,
MAT.26.11	For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me. 
MAT.26.12	For when
MAT.26.13	Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her.” 
MAT.26.14	Then one of the twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 
MAT.26.15	and
MAT.26.16	And from that time on, he began seeking a favorable opportunity in order that he could betray him. 
MAT.26.17	Now on the first day
MAT.26.18	And he said, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I am celebrating the Passover with you with my disciples.” ’ 
MAT.26.19	And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and they prepared the Passover. 
MAT.26.20	And when it
MAT.26.21	And while
MAT.26.22	And greatly distressed, each one began to say to him, “Surely I am not he, am I,
MAT.26.23	And he answered and
MAT.26.24	The Son of Man is going just as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if that man had not been born.” 
MAT.26.25	And Judas, the one who was betraying him, answered and
MAT.26.26	Now while
MAT.26.27	And after
MAT.26.28	for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. 
MAT.26.29	But I tell you, from now on I will never drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.” 
MAT.26.30	And after they
MAT.26.31	Then Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away because of me during this night, for it is written, 
MAT.26.31	‘I will strike the shepherd 
MAT.26.31	and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’
MAT.26.32	But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” 
MAT.26.33	But Peter answered and
MAT.26.34	Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you that during this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times!” 
MAT.26.35	Peter said to him, “Even if it is necessary for me to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the disciples said the same thing. 
MAT.26.36	Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and
MAT.26.37	And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be distressed and troubled. 
MAT.26.38	Then he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.” 
MAT.26.39	And going forward a little he fell down on his face, praying and saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”
MAT.26.40	And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “So, were you not able to stay awake with me one hour? 
MAT.26.41	Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak!” 
MAT.26.42	Again for the second time he went away and
MAT.26.43	And he came again and
MAT.26.44	And leaving them again, he went away and
MAT.26.45	Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
MAT.26.46	Get up, let us go! Behold, the one who is betraying me is approaching!” 
MAT.26.47	And while
MAT.26.48	Now the one who was betraying him had given them a sign, saying, “The one whom I kiss—he is the one.
MAT.26.49	And he came up to Jesus immediately and
MAT.26.50	And Jesus said to him, “Friend, do that
MAT.26.51	And behold, one of those with Jesus extended his
MAT.26.52	Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place! For all who take up the sword will die by the sword. 
MAT.26.53	Or do you think that I cannot call upon my Father, and he would put at my disposal at once more than twelve legions of angels? 
MAT.26.54	How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must happen in this way?” 
MAT.26.55	At that time Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber, to arrest me? Every day in the temple courts
MAT.26.56	But all this has happened in order that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then the disciples all abandoned him and
MAT.26.57	Now those who had arrested Jesus led him
MAT.26.58	But Peter was following him from a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And he went inside and
MAT.26.59	Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order that they could put him to death. 
MAT.26.60	And they did not find it,
MAT.26.61	and
MAT.26.62	And the high priest stood up and
MAT.26.63	But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, “I put you under oath by the living God, that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!” 
MAT.26.64	Jesus said to him, “You have said it.
MAT.26.65	Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have just now heard the blasphemy! 
MAT.26.66	What do you think?” And they answered and
MAT.26.67	Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists, and they slapped him,
MAT.26.68	saying, “Prophesy for us, you Christ! Who is it who hit you?” 
MAT.26.69	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a female slave came up to him and
MAT.26.70	But he denied it
MAT.26.71	And when he
MAT.26.72	And again he denied it
MAT.26.73	And after a little while those who were standing there came up and
MAT.26.74	Then he began to curse and to swear with an oath, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed. 
MAT.26.75	And Peter remembered the statement Jesus had said, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times,” and he went outside and
MAT.27.1	 Now when it
MAT.27.2	And after
MAT.27.3	Then when
MAT.27.4	saying, “I have sinned by
MAT.27.5	And throwing the silver coins into the temple he departed. And he went away and
MAT.27.6	But the chief priests took the silver coins and
MAT.27.7	And after
MAT.27.8	(For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood until today.) 
MAT.27.9	Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, who said, “And they took the thirty silver coins, the price of the one who had been priced, on whom a price had been set by the sons of Israel, 
MAT.27.10	and they gave them for the potter’s field, just as the Lord directed me.”
MAT.27.11	So Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the king of the Jews?” And Jesus said, “You say so.” 
MAT.27.12	And when he was being accused
MAT.27.13	Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?” 
MAT.27.14	And he did not reply to him, not even with reference to one statement, so that the governor was very astonished. 
MAT.27.15	Now at each feast, the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd—the one whom they wanted. 
MAT.27.16	And at that time they had a notorious prisoner named Jesus
MAT.27.17	So after
MAT.27.18	(For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy. 
MAT.27.19	And while
MAT.27.20	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas and put Jesus to death. 
MAT.27.21	So the governor answered and
MAT.27.22	Pilate said to them, “What then should I do with Jesus, the one who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified!” 
MAT.27.23	And he said, “Why? What wrong has he done?” But they began to shout
MAT.27.24	So Pilate, when he
MAT.27.25	And all the people answered and
MAT.27.26	Then he released Barabbas for them, but after
MAT.27.27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s residence and
MAT.27.28	And they stripped him and
MAT.27.29	and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it
MAT.27.30	And they spat on him and
MAT.27.31	And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the military cloak and put his own clothes on him, and led him away in order to crucify him.
MAT.27.32	And as they
MAT.27.33	And when they
MAT.27.34	they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink, and when he
MAT.27.35	And when they
MAT.27.36	And they sat down and
MAT.27.37	And they put above his head the charge against him in writing:
MAT.27.38	Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. 
MAT.27.39	And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads 
MAT.27.40	and saying, “The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild it
MAT.27.41	In the same way also the chief priests, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking him,
MAT.27.42	“He saved others; he is not able to save himself! He is the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him! 
MAT.27.43	He trusts in God; let him deliver him now if he wants to,
MAT.27.44	And in the same way even the robbers who were crucified with him were reviling him. 
MAT.27.45	Now from the sixth hour, darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour. 
MAT.27.46	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “
MAT.27.47	And some of those who were standing there, when they
MAT.27.48	And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it
MAT.27.49	But the others said, “Leave him
MAT.27.50	And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and
MAT.27.51	And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth shook and the rocks were split. 
MAT.27.52	And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, 
MAT.27.53	and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many. 
MAT.27.54	Now the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus, when they
MAT.27.55	And there were many women there, observing from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him, 
MAT.27.56	among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. 
MAT.27.57	Now when it was evening, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who also was a disciple of Jesus himself. 
MAT.27.58	This man approached Pilate and
MAT.27.59	And Joseph took the body and
MAT.27.60	and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a large stone to the entrance of the tomb and
MAT.27.61	Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb. 
MAT.27.62	Now on the next day, which is after the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate, 
MAT.27.63	saying, “Sir, we remember that while
MAT.27.64	Therefore give orders that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come and
MAT.27.65	Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it
MAT.27.66	So they went with the guard of soldiers and
MAT.28.1	 Now after the Sabbath, at the dawning on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to view the tomb. 
MAT.28.2	And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came up and
MAT.28.3	Now his appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow. 
MAT.28.4	And the guards trembled from the fear of him and became like dead men. 
MAT.28.5	But the angel answered and
MAT.28.6	He is not here, for he has been raised, just as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying. 
MAT.28.7	And go quickly, tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead, and behold, he is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there.’ Behold, I have told you.” 
MAT.28.8	And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and
MAT.28.9	And behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Greetings!” And they came up and
MAT.28.10	Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid! Go tell my brothers that they should go to Galilee, and there they will see me.” 
MAT.28.11	And while
MAT.28.12	And after they
MAT.28.13	telling them,
MAT.28.14	And if this matter is heard before the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”
MAT.28.15	So they took the money and
MAT.28.16	So the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated for them. 
MAT.28.17	And when they
MAT.28.18	And Jesus approached and
MAT.28.19	Therefore, go
MAT.28.20	teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the age.” 
MRK.1.1	 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
MRK.1.2	Just as it is written in the prophet Isaiah, 
MRK.1.2	“Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, 
MRK.1.2	who will prepare your way, 
MRK.1.3	the voice of one shouting in the wilderness, 
MRK.1.3	‘Prepare the way of the Lord, 
MRK.1.3	make straight his paths!’ ”
MRK.1.4	John was there baptizing in the wilderness, proclaiming
MRK.1.5	And all the Judean region and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. 
MRK.1.6	And John was dressed in camel’s hair and a belt made of leather around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. 
MRK.1.7	And he was preaching, saying, “One who is more powerful than I is coming after me, of whom I am not worthy to bend down and
MRK.1.8	I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” 
MRK.1.9	And it happened that in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John. 
MRK.1.10	And immediately as he
MRK.1.11	And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.” 
MRK.1.12	And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness. 
MRK.1.13	And he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him. 
MRK.1.14	And after
MRK.1.15	and saying, “The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the gospel!” 
MRK.1.16	And as he
MRK.1.17	And Jesus said to them, “Follow
MRK.1.18	And immediately they left their nets and
MRK.1.19	And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, and they were in the boat mending the nets. 
MRK.1.20	And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and
MRK.1.21	And they went into Capernaum and immediately on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue.
MRK.1.22	And they were amazed at his teaching, because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like the scribes. 
MRK.1.23	And so then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, 
MRK.1.24	saying, “Leave us alone,
MRK.1.25	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” 
MRK.1.26	And after
MRK.1.27	And they were all amazed, so that they began to discuss with one another, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him.” 
MRK.1.28	And the report about him then went out everywhere in the whole surrounding region of Galilee. 
MRK.1.29	And so then he departed from the synagogue and
MRK.1.30	Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down, suffering with a fever, and at once they told him about her. 
MRK.1.31	And he came and
MRK.1.32	Now when it
MRK.1.33	And the whole town was gathered together at the door. 
MRK.1.34	And he healed many who were sick
MRK.1.35	And getting up early in the morning while it was very dark, he departed and went to a deserted place, and there he was praying. 
MRK.1.36	And Simon and those who were with him searched diligently for him. 
MRK.1.37	And they found him and said to him, “Everyone is looking for you!” 
MRK.1.38	And he said to them, “Let us go elsewhere, into the neighboring rural towns, so that I can preach there also, because I have come out for this very reason.” 
MRK.1.39	And he went into all Galilee preaching in their synagogues and expelling demons. 
MRK.1.40	And a leper came to him, entreating him and kneeling down, saying
MRK.1.41	And becoming angry,
MRK.1.42	And immediately the leprosy went away from him and he was made clean. 
MRK.1.43	And warning him sternly, he sent him away at once. 
MRK.1.44	And he said to him, “See to it that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and bring for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. 
MRK.1.45	But he went out and
MRK.2.1	 And when he
MRK.2.2	And many had gathered, so that there was no longer room, not even at the door, and he was speaking the word to them. 
MRK.2.3	And they came bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them. 
MRK.2.4	And when
MRK.2.5	And when
MRK.2.6	Now some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 
MRK.2.7	“Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?” 
MRK.2.8	And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they were reasoning like this within themselves, said to them, “Why are you considering these things in your hearts? 
MRK.2.9	Which is easier to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk’? 
MRK.2.10	But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”—he said to the paralytic—
MRK.2.11	“I say to you, get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.” 
MRK.2.12	And he got up and immediately picked up his
MRK.2.13	And he went out again beside the sea,
MRK.2.14	And as he
MRK.2.15	And it happened that he was dining
MRK.2.16	And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they
MRK.2.17	And when
MRK.2.18	And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and said to him, “Why
MRK.2.19	And Jesus said to them, “The bridegroom’s attendants
MRK.2.20	But days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day. 
MRK.2.21	No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment. Otherwise
MRK.2.22	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise
MRK.2.23	And it happened that he was going through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and his disciples began to make their way while
MRK.2.24	And the Pharisees began to say
MRK.2.25	And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he had need and he and those who were with him were hungry—
MRK.2.26	how he entered into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the presentation, which it is not permitted to eat (except the priests) and also gave it
MRK.2.27	And he said to them, “The Sabbath was established for people, and not people for the Sabbath. 
MRK.2.28	So then, the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.” 
MRK.3.1	 And he entered into the synagogue again, and a man who had a withered hand was there. 
MRK.3.2	And they were watching him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, in order that they could accuse him. 
MRK.3.3	And he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come into the middle.” 
MRK.3.4	And he said to them, “Is it permitted on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent. 
MRK.3.5	And looking around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your
MRK.3.6	And the Pharisees went out immediately with the Herodians and began to conspire
MRK.3.7	And Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea,
MRK.3.8	and from Jerusalem and from Idumea and the other side of the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon a great crowd came to him because they
MRK.3.9	And he told his disciples that a small boat should stand ready for him because of the crowd, so that they would not press upon him. 
MRK.3.10	For he had healed many, so that all those who were suffering from diseases
MRK.3.11	And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, were falling down before him and crying out, saying, “You are the Son of God!” 
MRK.3.12	And he warned them strictly that they should not make him known. 
MRK.3.13	And he went up on the mountain and summoned those whom he wanted, and they came to him. 
MRK.3.14	And he appointed twelve,
MRK.3.15	and to have authority to expel demons. 
MRK.3.16	And he appointed the twelve.
MRK.3.17	and James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (and he gave to them the name Boanerges, that is, “Sons of Thunder”), 
MRK.3.18	and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot,
MRK.3.19	and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. 
MRK.3.20	And he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they were not even able to eat a meal. 
MRK.3.21	And when
MRK.3.22	And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul!” and “By the ruler of the demons he expels the demons!” 
MRK.3.23	And he called them to himself and
MRK.3.24	And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand. 
MRK.3.25	And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. 
MRK.3.26	And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand, but is at an end! 
MRK.3.27	But no one is able to enter into the house of a strong man and
MRK.3.28	“Truly I say to you that all the sins and the blasphemies will be forgiven the sons of men, however much they blaspheme. 
MRK.3.29	But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit does not have forgiveness forever,
MRK.3.30	because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.” 
MRK.3.31	And his mother and his brothers arrived, and standing outside, they sent word to him to summon him. 
MRK.3.32	And a crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers
MRK.3.33	And he answered them and
MRK.3.34	And looking around at those who were sitting around him in a circle, he said, “Behold, my mother and my brothers! 
MRK.3.35	For whoever does the will of God, this person is my brother and sister and mother.” 
MRK.4.1	 And again he began to teach beside the sea,
MRK.4.2	And he began to teach
MRK.4.3	“Listen! Behold, the sower went out to sow. 
MRK.4.4	And it happened that while he was sowing, some seed
MRK.4.5	And other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up at once, because it did not have any depth of soil. 
MRK.4.6	And when the sun rose it was scorched, and because it did not have enough root, it withered. 
MRK.4.7	And other seed fell among the thorn plants, and the thorn plants came up and choked it, and it did not produce grain.
MRK.4.8	And other seed fell on the good soil, and produced grain,
MRK.4.9	And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!” 
MRK.4.10	And when he was alone, those around him together with the twelve began asking
MRK.4.11	And he said to them, “To you has been granted the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside everything is in parables, 
MRK.4.12	so that 
MRK.4.12	‘they may look closely
MRK.4.12	and they may listen carefully
MRK.4.12	lest they turn and it be forgiven them.’ ”
MRK.4.13	And he said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? And how will you understand all the parables? 
MRK.4.14	The sower sows the word. 
MRK.4.15	And these are the ones beside the path where the word is sown, and whenever they hear it,
MRK.4.16	And these are like
MRK.4.17	And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Then when
MRK.4.18	And others are the ones sown among the thorn plants—these are the ones who hear the word, 
MRK.4.19	and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and
MRK.4.20	And those are the ones sown on the good soil, who hear the word and receive it
MRK.4.21	And he said to them, “Surely a lamp is not brought so that it may be put under a bushel basket or under a bed, is it?
MRK.4.22	For nothing is secret except so that it may be revealed, nor has become hidden except so that it will come to light. 
MRK.4.23	If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!” 
MRK.4.24	And he said to them, “Take care what you hear! With the measure by which you measure out, it will be measured out to you, and will be added to you. 
MRK.4.25	For whoever has, more will be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.” 
MRK.4.26	And he said, “The kingdom of God is like this: like a man scatters seed on the ground. 
MRK.4.27	And he sleeps and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows—he does not know how.
MRK.4.28	By itself the soil produces a crop: first the grass, then the head of grain, then the full grain in the head. 
MRK.4.29	But when the crop permits, he sends in the sickle right away, because the harvest has come.” 
MRK.4.30	And he said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or by what parable can we present it? 
MRK.4.31	It is like a mustard seed that when sown on the ground, although it
MRK.4.32	but when it is sown it grows up and becomes the largest of all the garden herbs, and sends out large branches so that the birds of the sky are able to nest in its shade.” 
MRK.4.33	And with many parables such as these he was speaking the word to them, as they were able to hear it.
MRK.4.34	And he did not speak to them without a parable, but in private he explained everything to his own disciples. 
MRK.4.35	And on that day, when it
MRK.4.36	And leaving the crowd, they took him along, as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him. 
MRK.4.37	And a great storm of wind developed, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already being filled with water.
MRK.4.38	And he was in the stern sleeping on the cushion, and they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, is it not a concern to you that we are perishing?” 
MRK.4.39	And he woke up and
MRK.4.40	And he said to them, “Why are you fearful? Do you not yet have faith?” 
MRK.4.41	And they were terribly frightened
MRK.5.1	 And they came to the other side of the sea,
MRK.5.2	And as
MRK.5.3	who lived
MRK.5.4	because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles had been shattered. And no one was strong enough to subdue him. 
MRK.5.5	And during every night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones. 
MRK.5.6	And when he
MRK.5.7	And crying out with a loud voice he said, “What have I to do with you
MRK.5.8	(For he was saying to him, “Come out of the man, unclean spirit!”) 
MRK.5.9	And he was asking him “What is your name?”
MRK.5.10	And he was imploring him many times that he would not send them out of the region. 
MRK.5.11	Now a large herd of pigs was there at the hill feeding, 
MRK.5.12	and they implored him, saying, “Send us to the pigs so that we may enter into them.” 
MRK.5.13	And he permitted them. And the unclean spirits came out and
MRK.5.14	And their herdsmen fled and reported it
MRK.5.15	And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there clothed and in his right mind—the one who had had the legion—and they were afraid. 
MRK.5.16	And those who had seen it
MRK.5.17	And they began to urge him to depart from their region. 
MRK.5.18	And as
MRK.5.19	And he did not permit him, but said to him, “Go to your home to your people and tell them all that the Lord has done for you, and that he has had mercy on you.” 
MRK.5.20	And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him, and they were all astonished. 
MRK.5.21	And after
MRK.5.22	And one of the rulers of the synagogue came—Jairus by name—and when he
MRK.5.23	And he was imploring him many times, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death!
MRK.5.24	And he went with him, and a large crowd was following him and pressing around him. 
MRK.5.25	And there was a woman who was suffering from hemorrhages
MRK.5.26	And she had endured many things under many physicians, and had spent all that she had
MRK.5.27	When she
MRK.5.28	for she was saying, “If I touch just his clothing, I will be healed!” 
MRK.5.29	And immediately her hemorrhage stopped
MRK.5.30	And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from himself, turned around in the crowd and
MRK.5.31	And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing upon you, and you say ‘Who touched me?’ ” 
MRK.5.32	And he was looking around to see the one who had done this. 
MRK.5.33	So the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. 
MRK.5.34	But he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be well from your suffering.” 
MRK.5.35	While
MRK.5.36	But Jesus, ignoring
MRK.5.37	And he did not allow anyone to follow along with him except Peter and James and John, the brother of James. 
MRK.5.38	And they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and saw a commotion, and people weeping and wailing loudly. 
MRK.5.39	And when he
MRK.5.40	And they began laughing
MRK.5.41	And taking hold of the child’s hand, he said to her, “
MRK.5.42	and immediately the girl stood up and began walking around
MRK.5.43	And he commanded them strictly that no one should learn of this, and said to give her something
MRK.6.1	 And he went out from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him. 
MRK.6.2	And when
MRK.6.3	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” And they were offended by him. 
MRK.6.4	And Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, and among his relatives, and in his own household.” 
MRK.6.5	And he was not able to do any miracle in that place except to lay his
MRK.6.6	And he was astonished because of their unbelief. 
MRK.6.6	And he was going around among the villages teaching. 
MRK.6.7	And he summoned the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. 
MRK.6.8	And he commanded them that they take along nothing for the journey except only a staff—no bread, no traveler’s bag, no money in their
MRK.6.9	but to put on sandals and not to wear two tunics. 
MRK.6.10	And he said to them, “Whenever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there. 
MRK.6.11	And whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, as you
MRK.6.12	And they went out and
MRK.6.13	And they were expelling many demons and anointing many sick people with olive oil and healing them.
MRK.6.14	And King Herod heard it,
MRK.6.15	But others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and others were saying, “He is a prophet like one of the prophets.” 
MRK.6.16	But when
MRK.6.17	For Herod himself had sent and
MRK.6.18	For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not permitted for you to have your brother’s wife.” 
MRK.6.19	So Herodias held a grudge against him and was wanting to kill him, and was not able to do so. 
MRK.6.20	For Herod was afraid of John, because he
MRK.6.21	And a suitable day came when Herod, on his birthday, gave a banquet for his courtiers and military tribunes and the most prominent men of Galilee. 
MRK.6.22	And when
MRK.6.23	And he swore to her,
MRK.6.24	And she went out and
MRK.6.25	And she came in immediately with haste to the king and
MRK.6.26	And although he
MRK.6.27	And immediately the king sent an executioner and
MRK.6.28	And he brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	And when
MRK.6.30	And the apostles regathered to Jesus and reported to him everything that they had done and that they had taught. 
MRK.6.31	And he said to them, “You yourselves come privately to an isolated place and rest for a short time.” For those who were coming and going were many, and they did not even have time to eat. 
MRK.6.32	And they went away in the boat to an isolated place by themselves. 
MRK.6.33	And many people saw them leaving and recognized them,
MRK.6.34	And getting out of the boat
MRK.6.35	And the hour had already become late when
MRK.6.36	Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding farms and villages and
MRK.6.37	But he answered and
MRK.6.38	And he said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go look!” And when they
MRK.6.39	And he ordered them all to recline in groups on the green grass. 
MRK.6.40	And they reclined in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. 
MRK.6.41	And taking the five loaves and the two fish and
MRK.6.42	And they all ate and were satisfied. 
MRK.6.43	And they picked up the broken pieces, twelve baskets full, and of the fish. 
MRK.6.44	And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men. 
MRK.6.45	And immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself dismissed the crowd. 
MRK.6.46	And after he
MRK.6.47	And when
MRK.6.48	And he saw them being beaten in their rowing
MRK.6.49	But when
MRK.6.50	For they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke with them and said to them, “Have courage, I am he! Do not be afraid!” 
MRK.6.51	And he went up with them into the boat, and the wind abated. And they were extraordinarily
MRK.6.52	because they did not understand concerning the loaves, but their hearts were hardened. 
MRK.6.53	And after they
MRK.6.54	And as they were getting out of the boat, people
MRK.6.55	They ran about through that whole region and began to carry around those who were sick
MRK.6.56	And wherever he would go, into villages or into towns or to farms, they would put those who were sick in the marketplaces and would implore him that if they could touch even the edge of his cloak. And all those who touched it were healed. 
MRK.7.1	 And the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered to him. 
MRK.7.2	And they saw that some of his disciples were eating their
MRK.7.3	(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands ritually,
MRK.7.4	And when they come
MRK.7.5	And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their
MRK.7.6	So he said to them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written, 
MRK.7.6	‘This people honors me with their
MRK.7.6	but their heart is far, far away from me. 
MRK.7.7	And they worship me in vain, 
MRK.7.7	teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’
MRK.7.8	Abandoning the commandment of God, you hold fast to the tradition of men.” 
MRK.7.9	And he said to them, “You splendidly ignore the commandment of God so that you can keep
MRK.7.10	For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’
MRK.7.11	But you say, ‘If a man says to his
MRK.7.12	you no longer permit him to do anything for his
MRK.7.13	thus
MRK.7.14	And summoning the crowd again, he said to them, “Listen to me, all of you, and understand: 
MRK.7.15	There is nothing outside of a person that is able to defile him by
MRK.7.17	And when he entered into the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable. 
MRK.7.18	And he said to them, “So are you also without understanding? Do you not understand that everything that is outside that goes into a person is not able to defile him? 
MRK.7.19	For it does not enter into his heart but into his
MRK.7.20	And he said, “What comes out of a person, that defiles a person. 
MRK.7.21	For from within, from the heart of people, come evil plans, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders, 
MRK.7.22	adulteries, acts of greed, malicious deeds, deceit, licentiousness, envy,
MRK.7.23	All these evil things come from within and defile a person.” 
MRK.7.24	And from there he set out and
MRK.7.25	But immediately a woman whose young daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, when she
MRK.7.26	Now the woman was a Greek—a Syrophoenician by nationality—and she was asking him that he would expel the demon from her daughter. 
MRK.7.27	And he said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it
MRK.7.28	But she answered and said to him, “Lord, even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” 
MRK.7.29	And he said to her, “Because of this statement, go! The demon has gone out of your daughter.” 
MRK.7.30	And when she
MRK.7.31	And again he went away from the region of Tyre and
MRK.7.32	And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they were imploring him that he would place his
MRK.7.33	And he took him away from the crowd by himself and
MRK.7.34	And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, “
MRK.7.35	And
MRK.7.36	And he ordered them that they should say nothing, but as much as he ordered them not to, they proclaimed it
MRK.7.37	And they were amazed beyond all measure, saying, “He has done all things well! He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak!” 
MRK.8.1	 In those days there was
MRK.8.2	“I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat. 
MRK.8.3	And if I send them away hungry to their homes they will give out on the way, and some of them have come from far away.” 
MRK.8.4	And his disciples answered him, “Where is anyone able to feed these people with bread here in the desert?” 
MRK.8.5	And he asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” So they said, “Seven.” 
MRK.8.6	And he commanded the crowd to recline for a meal on the ground, and taking the seven loaves, after he
MRK.8.7	And they had a few small fish, and after
MRK.8.8	And they ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces that were left, seven baskets full. 
MRK.8.9	Now there were about four thousand. And he sent them away. 
MRK.8.10	And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and
MRK.8.11	And the Pharisees came and began to argue with him, demanding from him a sign from heaven in order to
MRK.8.12	And sighing deeply in his spirit, he said, “Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation!” 
MRK.8.13	And he left them, got into the boat
MRK.8.14	And they had forgotten to take bread, and except for one loaf, they did not have any
MRK.8.15	And he ordered them, saying, “Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod!” 
MRK.8.16	And they began to discuss with one another that they had no bread. 
MRK.8.17	And knowing this,
MRK.8.18	Although you
MRK.8.19	When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?” They said to him, “Twelve.” 
MRK.8.20	“When I also
MRK.8.21	And he said to them, “Do you not yet understand?” 
MRK.8.22	And they came to Bethsaida. And they brought to him a blind man and implored him that he would touch him. 
MRK.8.23	And he took hold of the blind man’s hand and
MRK.8.24	And looking up he said, “I see people, for I see them
MRK.8.25	Then he placed his
MRK.8.26	And he sent him to his home, saying, “Do not even go into the village.” 
MRK.8.27	And Jesus and his disciples went out to the villages of Caesarea Philippi, and on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, “Who do people say that I am?” 
MRK.8.28	And they told him, saying, “John the Baptist, and others Elijah, and others that you are one of the prophets.” 
MRK.8.29	And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered and
MRK.8.30	And he warned them that they should tell no one about him. 
MRK.8.31	And he began to teach them that it was necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise. 
MRK.8.32	And he was speaking openly about the subject, and Peter took him aside and
MRK.8.33	But turning around and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan, because you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but the things of people!” 
MRK.8.34	And summoning the crowd together with his disciples, he said to them, “If anyone wants to come
MRK.8.35	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of me and of the gospel will save it. 
MRK.8.36	For what does it benefit a person to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? 
MRK.8.37	For what can a person give in exchange for his life? 
MRK.8.38	For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.” 
MRK.9.1	 And he said to them, “Truly I say to you, that there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the kingdom of God having come with power.” 
MRK.9.2	And after six days, Jesus took along Peter and James and John, and led them to a high mountain by themselves alone. And he was transfigured before them, 
MRK.9.3	and his clothing became radiant—extremely white, like no cloth refiner on earth can make so white.
MRK.9.4	And Elijah appeared to them together with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. 
MRK.9.5	And Peter answered and
MRK.9.6	(For he did not know what he should answer, because they were terrified.) 
MRK.9.7	And a cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came from the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!” 
MRK.9.8	And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus alone. 
MRK.9.9	And as
MRK.9.10	And they kept the matter to themselves, discussing what this rising from the dead meant.
MRK.9.11	And they asked him, saying, “Why do
MRK.9.12	And he said to them, “Elijah indeed does come first and
MRK.9.13	But I tell you that indeed Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.” 
MRK.9.14	And when they
MRK.9.15	And immediately the whole crowd, when they
MRK.9.16	And he asked them, “What are you arguing about with them?” 
MRK.9.17	And one individual from the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought to you my son who has a spirit that makes him mute.
MRK.9.18	And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down and he foams at the mouth and grinds his
MRK.9.19	And he answered them and
MRK.9.20	And they brought him to him. And when he
MRK.9.21	And he asked his father how long it was since this had been happening to him. And he said, “From childhood. 
MRK.9.22	And often it has thrown him both into fire and into water, in order that it could destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have compassion on us and
MRK.9.23	But Jesus said to him, “If you are able! All things are possible for the one who believes!” 
MRK.9.24	Immediately the father of the child cried out and
MRK.9.25	Now when
MRK.9.26	And it came out, screaming and convulsing him
MRK.9.27	But Jesus took hold of his hand and
MRK.9.28	And after
MRK.9.29	And he said to them, “This kind can come out by nothing except by prayer.”
MRK.9.30	And from there they went out and
MRK.9.31	for he was teaching his disciples and was telling them, “The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he
MRK.9.32	But they did not understand the statement, and they were afraid to ask him. 
MRK.9.33	And they came to Capernaum. And after he
MRK.9.34	But they were silent, because they had argued with one another on the way about who was greatest. 
MRK.9.35	And he sat down and
MRK.9.36	And he took a young child and
MRK.9.37	“Whoever welcomes one of the young children such as these in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me, but the one who sent me.” 
MRK.9.38	John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone expelling demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us.” 
MRK.9.39	But Jesus said, “Do not prevent him, because there is no one who does a miracle in my name and will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me. 
MRK.9.40	For whoever is not against us is for us. 
MRK.9.41	For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name because you are Christ’s, truly I say to you that he will never lose his reward. 
MRK.9.42	“And whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it is better for him if instead a large millstone
MRK.9.43	And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life crippled than, having two hands, to go into hell—into the unquenchable fire!
MRK.9.45	And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life lame than, having two feet, to be thrown into hell!
MRK.9.47	And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out! It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than, having two eyes, to be thrown into hell, 
MRK.9.48	‘where their worm does not die and the fire is not extinguished.’
MRK.9.49	For everyone will be salted with fire. 
MRK.9.50	Salt is good, but if the salt becomes deprived of its salt content, by what can you make it salty? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with one another.” 
MRK.10.1	 And from there he set out and
MRK.10.2	And they asked
MRK.10.3	And he answered and
MRK.10.4	So they said, “Moses permitted a man
MRK.10.5	But Jesus said to them, “He wrote this commandment for you because of your hardness of heart. 
MRK.10.6	But from the beginning of creation ‘he made them male and female.
MRK.10.7	Because of this a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife,
MRK.10.8	and the two will become one flesh,’
MRK.10.9	Therefore what God has joined together, man must not separate.” 
MRK.10.10	And in the house again the disciples began to ask
MRK.10.11	And he said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her. 
MRK.10.12	And if she divorces her husband and
MRK.10.13	And they were bringing young children to him so that he could touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. 
MRK.10.14	But when
MRK.10.15	Truly I say to you, whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a young child will never enter into it.” 
MRK.10.16	And after
MRK.10.17	And as
MRK.10.18	So Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. 
MRK.10.19	You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.’ ”
MRK.10.20	And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth.” 
MRK.10.21	And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: Go, sell all that you have, and give the proceeds
MRK.10.22	But he looked gloomy at the statement and
MRK.10.23	And Jesus looked around and
MRK.10.24	And the disciples were astounded at his words. But Jesus answered and
MRK.10.25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God.” 
MRK.10.26	And they were very astounded, saying to one another, “And who can be saved?” 
MRK.10.27	Jesus looked at them and
MRK.10.28	Peter began to say to him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed you.” 
MRK.10.29	Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields on account of me and on account of the gospel 
MRK.10.30	who will not
MRK.10.31	But many who are first will be last, and the last first.” 
MRK.10.32	Now they were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going on ahead of them. And they were astounded, but those who were following him
MRK.10.33	“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles. 
MRK.10.34	And they will mock him and spit on him and flog him and kill him,
MRK.10.35	And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and
MRK.10.36	And he said to them, “What do you want that I do
MRK.10.37	So they said to him, “Grant to us that we may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your glory.” 
MRK.10.38	But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?” 
MRK.10.39	And they said to him, “We are able.” So Jesus said to them, “You will drink the cup that I drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, 
MRK.10.40	but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but is for those for whom it has been prepared.” 
MRK.10.41	And when they
MRK.10.42	And Jesus called them to himself and
MRK.10.43	But it is not like this among you! But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 
MRK.10.44	and whoever wants to be most prominent among you must be the slave of all. 
MRK.10.45	For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” 
MRK.10.46	And they came to Jericho. And as
MRK.10.47	And when he
MRK.10.48	And many people warned him that he should be quiet. But he was crying out even more loudly,
MRK.10.49	And Jesus stopped and
MRK.10.50	And he threw off his cloak, jumped up, and
MRK.10.51	And Jesus answered him and
MRK.10.52	And Jesus said to him, “Go, your faith has healed you.” And immediately he regained his sight and began to follow
MRK.11.1	 And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples 
MRK.11.2	and said to them, “Go into the village before you, and right away as you
MRK.11.3	And if anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say
MRK.11.4	And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it. 
MRK.11.5	And some of those who were standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” 
MRK.11.6	So they told them, just as Jesus had said, and they allowed them to take it.
MRK.11.7	And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, and he sat on it. 
MRK.11.8	And many people spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread
MRK.11.9	And those who went ahead and those who were following were shouting, 
MRK.11.9	“Hosanna! 
MRK.11.9	Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!
MRK.11.10	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! 
MRK.11.10	Hosanna in the highest heaven!”
MRK.11.11	And he went into Jerusalem to the temple, and after
MRK.11.12	And on the next day as
MRK.11.13	And when he
MRK.11.14	And he responded and
MRK.11.15	And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered into the temple courts
MRK.11.16	And he did not permit anyone to carry objects
MRK.11.17	And he began to teach
MRK.11.17	‘My house will be called a house of prayer 
MRK.11.17	for all the nations,’
MRK.11.17	but you have made it a cave of robbers!” 
MRK.11.18	And the chief priests and the scribes heard it,
MRK.11.19	And when evening came they went out of the city. 
MRK.11.20	And as they
MRK.11.21	And Peter remembered and
MRK.11.22	And Jesus answered and
MRK.11.23	Truly I say to you that whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea!’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. 
MRK.11.24	For this reason I say to you, whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received it,
MRK.11.25	And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him,
MRK.11.27	And they came again to Jerusalem. And as
MRK.11.28	and said to him, “By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority that you do these things?” 
MRK.11.29	So Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question. Answer me and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. 
MRK.11.30	The baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men? Answer me!” 
MRK.11.31	And they began to discuss
MRK.11.32	But if we say, ‘From men’ ”—they were afraid of the crowd, because they all looked upon John as truly a prophet.
MRK.11.33	And they replied to Jesus saying, “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.” 
MRK.12.1	 And he began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard, and put a fence around it, and dug a trough for the winepress, and built a watchtower, and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey. 
MRK.12.2	And he sent a slave to the tenant farmers at the proper time, so that he could collect some of the fruit of the vineyard from the tenant farmers. 
MRK.12.3	And they seized him and
MRK.12.4	And again he sent to them another slave, and that one they struck on the head and dishonored. 
MRK.12.5	And he sent another, and that one they killed. And he sent
MRK.12.6	He had one more, a beloved son. Last of all he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ 
MRK.12.7	But those tenant farmers said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours!’ 
MRK.12.8	And they seized and
MRK.12.9	What
MRK.12.10	Have you not read this scripture: 
MRK.12.10	‘The stone which the builders rejected, 
MRK.12.10	this has become the cornerstone.
MRK.12.11	This came about from the Lord, 
MRK.12.11	and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”
MRK.12.12	And they were seeking to arrest him, and they were afraid of the crowd, because they knew that he had told the parable with reference to them. And they left him and
MRK.12.13	And they sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him so that they could catch him unawares in a statement. 
MRK.12.14	And when they
MRK.12.15	But because he
MRK.12.16	So they brought one.
MRK.12.17	And Jesus said to them, “Give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!” And they were utterly amazed at him. 
MRK.12.18	And Sadducees—who say there is no resurrection—came up to him and began to ask
MRK.12.19	“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if someone’s brother dies and he leaves behind a wife and does not leave a child, that his brother should take the wife and father
MRK.12.20	There were seven brothers, and the first took a wife. And when he
MRK.12.21	And the second took her, and he died without leaving descendants. And the third likewise. 
MRK.12.22	And the seven did not leave descendants. Last of all the woman also died. 
MRK.12.23	In the resurrection, when they rise, whose
MRK.12.24	Jesus said to them, “Are you not deceived because of this, because you
MRK.12.25	For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. 
MRK.12.26	Now concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses in the passage about the bush
MRK.12.27	He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You are very much mistaken!” 
MRK.12.28	And one of the scribes came up and
MRK.12.29	Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Listen, Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one. 
MRK.12.30	And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.’
MRK.12.31	The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’
MRK.12.32	And the scribe said to him, “That is true, Teacher. You have said correctly
MRK.12.33	And to love him from your
MRK.12.34	And Jesus, when he
MRK.12.35	And continuing, Jesus said while
MRK.12.36	David himself said by the Holy Spirit, 
MRK.12.36	‘The Lord said to my Lord, 
MRK.12.36	“Sit at my right hand, 
MRK.12.36	until I put your enemies 
MRK.12.36	under your feet.” ’
MRK.12.37	David himself calls him ‘Lord,’ and how is he his son?” And the large crowd was listening to him gladly. 
MRK.12.38	And in his teaching he said, “Beware of the scribes, who like walking around in long robes and greetings in the marketplaces 
MRK.12.39	and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets, 
MRK.12.40	who devour the houses of widows and pray lengthy prayers for the sake of appearance. These will receive more severe condemnation!” 
MRK.12.41	And he sat down opposite the contribution box and
MRK.12.42	And one poor widow came and
MRK.12.43	And summoning his disciples, he said to them, “Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all those who put offerings
MRK.12.44	For they all contributed
MRK.13.1	 And as
MRK.13.2	And Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left here on another stone that will not be thrown down!” 
MRK.13.3	And as
MRK.13.4	“Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?” 
MRK.13.5	So Jesus began to say to them, “Watch out that no one deceives you! 
MRK.13.6	Many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and they will deceive many. 
MRK.13.7	And when you hear about wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. This must happen, but the end is not yet. 
MRK.13.8	For nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines. These things are the beginning of birth pains. 
MRK.13.9	“But you, watch out for yourselves! They will hand you over to councils and you will be beaten in the synagogues and will have to stand before governors and kings because of me, for a witness to them. 
MRK.13.10	And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations.
MRK.13.11	And when they arrest you and
MRK.13.12	And brother will hand over brother to death, and a father his
MRK.13.13	And you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end—this one will be saved. 
MRK.13.14	“But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be” (let the one who reads understand), “then those in Judea must flee to the mountains! 
MRK.13.15	The one
MRK.13.16	and the one who is in the field must not turn back to pick up his cloak. 
MRK.13.17	And woe to those who are pregnant
MRK.13.18	But pray that it will not happen in winter. 
MRK.13.19	For in those days there will be tribulation of such a kind as has not happened from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, and never will happen. 
MRK.13.20	And if the Lord had not shortened the days, no human being would be saved.
MRK.13.21	“And at that time if anyone should say to you, “Behold, here is the Christ,’ ‘Behold, there he is,’ do not believe him!
MRK.13.22	For false messiahs and false prophets will appear, and will produce signs and wonders in order to mislead, if possible, the elect. 
MRK.13.23	But you, watch out! I have told you everything ahead of time! 
MRK.13.24	“But in those days, after that tribulation, 
MRK.13.24	‘the sun will be darkened 
MRK.13.24	and the moon will not give its light, 
MRK.13.25	and the stars will be falling from heaven, 
MRK.13.25	and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.’
MRK.13.26	And then they will see the Son of Man arriving in the clouds with great power and glory. 
MRK.13.27	And then he will send out the angels, and will gather the
MRK.13.28	“Now learn the parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch has already become tender and puts forth its
MRK.13.29	So also you, when you see these things happening, know
MRK.13.30	Truly I say to you that this generation will never pass away until all these things take place! 
MRK.13.31	Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. 
MRK.13.32	“But concerning that day or hour no one knows—not even the angels in heaven nor the Son—except the Father. 
MRK.13.33	Watch out! Be alert, because you do not know when the time is! 
MRK.13.34	It is like a man away on a journey, who left his house and gave his slaves authority—to each one his work—and to the doorkeeper he gave orders that he should be on the alert. 
MRK.13.35	Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming—whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or early in the morning—
MRK.13.36	lest he arrive suddenly and
MRK.13.37	And what I say to you, I say to everyone: Be on the alert!” 
MRK.14.1	 Now after two days it was the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread, and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how, after
MRK.14.2	For they said, “Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar by the people.” 
MRK.14.3	And while
MRK.14.4	But some were expressing indignation to one another:
MRK.14.5	For this perfumed oil could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor!” And they began to scold
MRK.14.6	But Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why do you cause trouble for her? She has done a good deed to me. 
MRK.14.7	For the poor you always have with you, and you can do good for them whenever you want, but you do not always have me. 
MRK.14.8	She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand
MRK.14.9	And truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her. 
MRK.14.10	And Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them. 
MRK.14.11	And when
MRK.14.12	And on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, “Where do you want us to go and
MRK.14.13	And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him, 
MRK.14.14	and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’ 
MRK.14.15	And he will show you a large upstairs room furnished
MRK.14.16	And the disciples went out and came into the city and found everything
MRK.14.17	And when it
MRK.14.18	And while
MRK.14.19	They began to be distressed and to say to him one by one, “Surely not I?”
MRK.14.20	But he said to them, “It is one of the twelve—the one who is dipping bread
MRK.14.21	For the Son of Man is going just as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if that man had not been born.” 
MRK.14.22	And while
MRK.14.23	And after
MRK.14.24	And he said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many. 
MRK.14.25	Truly I say to you that I will never drink of the fruit of the vine any longer until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.” 
MRK.14.26	And after they
MRK.14.27	And Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away, because it is written, 
MRK.14.27	‘I will strike the shepherd 
MRK.14.27	and the sheep will be scattered.’
MRK.14.28	But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” 
MRK.14.29	But Peter said to him, “Even if they all fall away, certainly I will not!” 
MRK.14.30	And Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you that today—this night—before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times!” 
MRK.14.31	But he kept saying emphatically, “If it is necessary for me to die with you, I will never deny you!” And they all were saying the same thing also. 
MRK.14.32	And they came to a place named
MRK.14.33	And he took along Peter and James and John with him, and he began to be distressed and troubled. 
MRK.14.34	And he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake.” 
MRK.14.35	And going forward a little he fell to the ground and began to pray
MRK.14.36	And he said, “Abba,
MRK.14.37	And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “Simon, are you sleeping? Were you not able to stay awake one hour? 
MRK.14.38	Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak!” 
MRK.14.39	And again he went away and
MRK.14.40	And again he came and
MRK.14.41	And he came the third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough! The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
MRK.14.42	Get up, let us go! Behold, the one who is betraying me is approaching!” 
MRK.14.43	And immediately, while
MRK.14.44	Now the one who was betraying him had given them a sign, saying, “The one whom I kiss—he is the one.
MRK.14.45	And when he
MRK.14.46	So they laid hands on him and arrested him. 
MRK.14.47	But a certain one of the bystanders, drawing his
MRK.14.48	And Jesus answered and
MRK.14.49	Every day I was with you in the temple courts
MRK.14.50	And they all abandoned him and
MRK.14.51	And a certain young man was following him, clothed only in a linen cloth on his naked body. And they attempted to seize
MRK.14.52	but he left behind the linen cloth and
MRK.14.53	And they led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together. 
MRK.14.54	And Peter followed him from a distance, right inside, into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with the officers and warming himself by the fire. 
MRK.14.55	Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, and they did not find it.
MRK.14.56	For many gave false testimony against him, and their
MRK.14.57	And some stood up and
MRK.14.58	“We heard him saying, ‘I will destroy this temple made by hands, and within three days I will build another not made by hands.” 
MRK.14.59	And their testimony was not even consistent about this. 
MRK.14.60	And the high priest stood up in the midst of them and
MRK.14.61	But he was silent and did not reply anything. Again the high priest asked him and said to him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” 
MRK.14.62	And Jesus said, “I am, and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power
MRK.14.63	And the high priest tore his clothes and
MRK.14.64	You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?”
MRK.14.65	And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him with their fists, and to say to him “Prophesy!” And the officers received him with slaps in the face.
MRK.14.66	And while
MRK.14.67	And when
MRK.14.68	But he denied it,
MRK.14.69	And the female slave, when she
MRK.14.70	But he denied it
MRK.14.71	And he began to curse and to swear with an oath, “I do not know this man whom you are talking about!” 
MRK.14.72	And immediately a rooster crowed for the second time. And Peter remembered the statement, how Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times,” and throwing himself down, he began to weep.
MRK.15.1	 And as soon as morning came, after
MRK.15.2	And Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” And he answered him and
MRK.15.3	And the chief priests began to accuse
MRK.15.4	So Pilate asked him again, saying, “Do you not answer anything? See how many charges
MRK.15.5	But Jesus did not answer anything further, so that Pilate was astonished. 
MRK.15.6	Now at each feast he customarily released
MRK.15.7	And the one named Barabbas
MRK.15.8	And the crowd came up and
MRK.15.9	So Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?” 
MRK.15.10	(For he realized that the chief priests had handed him over because of envy.) 
MRK.15.11	But the chief priests incited the crowd so that he would release for them Barabbas
MRK.15.12	So Pilate answered and said to them again, “Then what do you want me to do with the one whom you call the king of the Jews?” 
MRK.15.13	And they shouted again, “Crucify him!” 
MRK.15.14	And Pilate said to them, “Why? What evil has he done?” But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!” 
MRK.15.15	So Pilate, because he
MRK.15.16	So the soldiers led him away into the palace (that is, the governor’s residence) and called together the whole cohort. 
MRK.15.17	And they put a purple cloak on him, and after
MRK.15.18	And they began to greet him, “Hail, king of the Jews!” 
MRK.15.19	And they repeatedly struck
MRK.15.20	And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes
MRK.15.21	And they forced a certain man who was passing by, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), who was coming from the country, to carry his cross. 
MRK.15.22	And they brought him to the place 
MRK.15.23	And they attempted to give
MRK.15.24	And they crucified him and divided his clothes among themselves
MRK.15.25	Now it was the third hour when they crucified him. 
MRK.15.26	And the inscription of the charge against him was written, “The king of the Jews.” 
MRK.15.27	And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.
MRK.15.29	And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild it
MRK.15.30	save yourself by
MRK.15.31	In the same way also the chief priests, along with the scribes, were mocking him
MRK.15.32	Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe! Even those who were crucified with him were reviling him. 
MRK.15.33	And when
MRK.15.34	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “
MRK.15.35	And some of the bystanders, when they
MRK.15.36	And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it
MRK.15.37	But Jesus uttered a loud cry and
MRK.15.38	And the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 
MRK.15.39	And when
MRK.15.40	And there were also women observing from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger
MRK.15.41	who used to follow
MRK.15.42	And when it
MRK.15.43	Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the council who was also himself looking forward to
MRK.15.44	And Pilate was surprised that he was already dead, and summoning the centurion, asked him whether he had died already. 
MRK.15.45	And when he
MRK.15.46	And after
MRK.15.47	Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was placed. 
MRK.16.1	 And when
MRK.16.2	And very early in the morning on the first day of the week they came to the tomb after
MRK.16.3	And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?” 
MRK.16.4	And when they
MRK.16.5	And as they
MRK.16.6	But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified. He has been raised, he is not here! See the place where they laid him! 
MRK.16.7	But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.” 
MRK.16.8	And they went out and
MRK.16.8	〚So they promptly reported all the things they had been commanded to those around Peter. And after these things, Jesus himself also sent out through them from the east even as far as the west the holy and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation. Amen.〛 
MRK.16.8	〚
MRK.16.9	Now early on the first day of the week, after he
MRK.16.10	She went out and
MRK.16.11	And those, when they
MRK.16.12	And after these things, he appeared in a different form to two of them as they
MRK.16.13	And these went and
MRK.16.14	And later, while
MRK.16.15	And he said to them, “Go
MRK.16.16	The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who refuses to believe will be condemned. 
MRK.16.17	And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will expel demons, they will speak in new tongues, 
MRK.16.18	they will pick up
MRK.16.19	Then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. 
MRK.16.20	And they went out and
LUK.1.1	 Since many have attempted to compile an account concerning the events that have been fulfilled among us, 
LUK.1.2	just as those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning passed on to us, 
LUK.1.3	it seemed best to me also—because I
LUK.1.4	so that you may know the certainty concerning the things about which you were taught. 
LUK.1.5	It happened that in the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest, Zechariah by name, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife
LUK.1.6	And they were both righteous in the sight of God, living blamelessly in all the commandments and regulations of the Lord. 
LUK.1.7	And they did not have
LUK.1.8	And it happened that while
LUK.1.9	according to the custom of the priesthood he was chosen by lot to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense. 
LUK.1.10	And the whole crowd of the people were praying outside at the hour of the incense offering. 
LUK.1.11	And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 
LUK.1.12	And Zechariah was terrified when he
LUK.1.13	But the angel said to him, 
LUK.1.13	“Do not be afraid, Zechariah, 
LUK.1.13	because your prayer has been heard, 
LUK.1.13	and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, 
LUK.1.13	and you will call his name John. 
LUK.1.14	And you will experience joy and exultation,
LUK.1.14	and many will rejoice at his birth. 
LUK.1.15	For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, 
LUK.1.15	and he must never drink wine or beer, 
LUK.1.15	and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit 
LUK.1.15	while he is
LUK.1.16	And he will turn many of the sons of Israel 
LUK.1.16	to the Lord their God. 
LUK.1.17	And he will go on before him 
LUK.1.17	in the spirit and power of Elijah, 
LUK.1.17	to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, 
LUK.1.17	and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, 
LUK.1.17	to prepare for the Lord a people made ready.” 
LUK.1.18	And Zechariah said to the angel, “By what will I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years!”
LUK.1.19	And the angel answered and
LUK.1.20	And behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because
LUK.1.21	And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and began to wonder
LUK.1.22	And when he
LUK.1.23	And it happened that when the days of his service came to an end, he went away to his home. 
LUK.1.24	Now after these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she kept herself in seclusion for five months, saying, 
LUK.1.25	“Thus the Lord has done for me in the days in which he has concerned himself with me,
LUK.1.26	Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee named
LUK.1.27	to a virgin legally promised in marriage to a man named
LUK.1.28	And he came to her and
LUK.1.29	But she was greatly perplexed at the statement, and was pondering what sort of greeting this might be. 
LUK.1.30	And the angel said to her, 
LUK.1.30	“Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 
LUK.1.31	And behold, you will conceive in the womb and will give birth to a son, 
LUK.1.31	and you will call his name Jesus. 
LUK.1.32	This one will be great, and he will be called the Son of the Most High, 
LUK.1.32	and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David. 
LUK.1.33	And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever,
LUK.1.33	and of his kingdom there will be no end. 
LUK.1.34	And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I have not had sexual relations with a man?” 
LUK.1.35	And the angel answered and
LUK.1.35	“The Holy Spirit will come upon you, 
LUK.1.35	and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. 
LUK.1.35	Therefore also the one to be born will be called holy, the Son of God. 
LUK.1.36	And behold, your relative Elizabeth—she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren. 
LUK.1.37	For nothing will be impossible with God.”
LUK.1.38	So Mary said, “Behold, the Lord’s female slave! May it happen to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her. 
LUK.1.39	Now in those days Mary set out and
LUK.1.40	and entered into the house of Zechariah, and greeted Elizabeth. 
LUK.1.41	And it happened that when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby in her womb leaped and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 
LUK.1.42	And she cried out with a loud shout and said, 
LUK.1.42	“Blessed are you among women, 
LUK.1.42	and blessed is the fruit of your womb! 
LUK.1.43	And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
LUK.1.44	For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy! 
LUK.1.45	And blessed is she who believed that there will be a fulfillment to what was spoken to her from the Lord!” 
LUK.1.46	And Mary said, 
LUK.1.46	“My soul exalts the Lord, 
LUK.1.47	and my spirit has rejoiced greatly in God my Savior, 
LUK.1.48	because he has looked upon the humble state of his female slave, 
LUK.1.48	for behold, from now on all generations will consider me blessed, 
LUK.1.49	because the Mighty One has done great things for me, 
LUK.1.49	and holy is his name. 
LUK.1.50	And his mercy is for generation after generation 
LUK.1.50	to those who fear him. 
LUK.1.51	He has done a mighty deed with his arm; 
LUK.1.51	he has dispersed the proud in the thoughts of their hearts. 
LUK.1.52	He has brought down rulers from their thrones, 
LUK.1.52	and has exalted the lowly. 
LUK.1.53	He has filled those who are hungry with good things, 
LUK.1.53	and those who are rich he has sent away empty-handed. 
LUK.1.54	He has helped Israel his servant, 
LUK.1.54	remembering his mercy, 
LUK.1.55	just as he spoke to our fathers, 
LUK.1.55	to Abraham and to his descendants forever.”
LUK.1.56	And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her home. 
LUK.1.57	Now the time came for Elizabeth that she should give birth, and she gave birth to a son. 
LUK.1.58	And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her,
LUK.1.59	And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were wanting to name him after
LUK.1.60	And his mother answered and
LUK.1.61	And they said to her, “There is no one of your relatives who is called by this name.” 
LUK.1.62	So they made signs to his father asking what he wanted him to be named, 
LUK.1.63	and he asked for a writing tablet and
LUK.1.64	And his mouth and his tongue were opened immediately, and he began to speak,
LUK.1.65	And fear came on all those who lived near them, and in all the hill country of Judea all these events were discussed. 
LUK.1.66	And all those who heard kept these things
LUK.1.67	And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying, 
LUK.1.68	“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, 
LUK.1.68	because he has visited to help and has redeemed
LUK.1.69	and has raised up a horn of salvation for us 
LUK.1.69	in the house of his servant David, 
LUK.1.70	just as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times— 
LUK.1.71	salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those who hate us, 
LUK.1.72	to show mercy to our fathers 
LUK.1.72	and to remember his holy covenant, 
LUK.1.73	the oath that he swore to Abraham our father, 
LUK.1.73	to grant us 
LUK.1.74	that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies, 
LUK.1.74	could serve him without fear 
LUK.1.75	in holiness and righteousness 
LUK.1.75	before him all our days. 
LUK.1.76	And so you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High, 
LUK.1.76	for you will go on before the Lord to prepare his ways, 
LUK.1.77	to give knowledge of salvation to his people 
LUK.1.77	by the forgiveness of their sins, 
LUK.1.78	because of the merciful compassion
LUK.1.78	by which the dawn will visit to help us from on high, 
LUK.1.79	to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, 
LUK.1.79	to direct our feet into the way of peace.” 
LUK.1.80	And the child kept growing and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel. 
LUK.2.1	 Now it happened that in those days a decree went out from Caesar
LUK.2.2	(This first registration took place when
LUK.2.3	And everyone went to be registered, each one to his own town. 
LUK.2.4	So Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family line of David, 
LUK.2.5	to be registered together with Mary, who was legally promised in marriage to him and
LUK.2.6	And it happened that while they were there, the time came
LUK.2.7	And she gave birth to her firstborn son, and wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn. 
LUK.2.8	And there were shepherds in the same region, living out of doors and keeping watch, guarding over their flock by night. 
LUK.2.9	And an angel of the Lord stood near them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terribly frightened.
LUK.2.10	And the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring good news to you of great joy which will be for all the people: 
LUK.2.11	that today a Savior, who is Christ the Lord, was born for you in the city of David. 
LUK.2.12	And this will be the sign for you: you will find the baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.” 
LUK.2.13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying, 
LUK.2.14	“Glory to God in the highest, 
LUK.2.14	and on earth peace 
LUK.2.14	among people with whom he is pleased!”
LUK.2.15	And it happened that when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds began to say
LUK.2.16	And they went hurrying and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby who was lying in the manger. 
LUK.2.17	And when they
LUK.2.18	And all who heard it
LUK.2.19	But Mary treasured up all these words, pondering them
LUK.2.20	And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them. 
LUK.2.21	And when eight days were completed so that he could be circumcised,
LUK.2.22	And when the days of their purification were completed according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him
LUK.2.23	(just as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male that opens the womb will be called holy to the Lord”)
LUK.2.24	and to offer a sacrifice according to what was stated in the law of the Lord, “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”
LUK.2.25	And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was
LUK.2.26	And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he would see the Lord’s Christ.
LUK.2.27	And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus so that they could do for him according to what was customary under the law, 
LUK.2.28	he took him in his
LUK.2.29	“Now dismiss your slave in peace, Lord, 
LUK.2.29	according to your word. 
LUK.2.30	For my eyes have seen your salvation 
LUK.2.31	that you have prepared in the presence of all the peoples, 
LUK.2.32	a light for revelation to the Gentiles, 
LUK.2.32	and glory to your people Israel.” 
LUK.2.33	And his father and mother were astonished at what was said about him. 
LUK.2.34	And Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, “Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed
LUK.2.35	and a sword will pierce your own soul also, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed!” 
LUK.2.36	And there was a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher (she was advanced in years,
LUK.2.37	and herself as a widow up to eighty-four years)
LUK.2.38	And at that same hour she approached and
LUK.2.39	And when they had completed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. 
LUK.2.40	And the child was growing and becoming strong, filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon him. 
LUK.2.41	And his parents went every year to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover. 
LUK.2.42	And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the feast. 
LUK.2.43	And after
LUK.2.44	but believing him to be in the group of travelers, they went a day’s journey. And they began searching for
LUK.2.45	and when they
LUK.2.46	And it happened that after three days they found him in the temple courts,
LUK.2.47	And all who heard him were amazed at his insight and his
LUK.2.48	And when they
LUK.2.49	And he said to them, “Why
LUK.2.50	And they did not understand the statement that he spoke to them. 
LUK.2.51	And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was submitting to them. And his mother treasured all these things in her heart. 
LUK.2.52	And Jesus was advancing in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and with people. 
LUK.3.1	 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
LUK.3.2	in the time of the high priest Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness. 
LUK.3.3	And he went into all the surrounding region of the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, 
LUK.3.4	as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah, 
LUK.3.4	“The voice of one crying out in the wilderness, 
LUK.3.4	‘Prepare the way of the Lord, 
LUK.3.4	make his paths straight! 
LUK.3.5	Every valley will be filled, 
LUK.3.5	and every mountain and hill will be leveled, 
LUK.3.5	and the crooked will become straight, 
LUK.3.5	and the rough road will become
LUK.3.6	and all flesh will see the salvation of God.’ ”
LUK.3.7	Therefore he was saying to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, “Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
LUK.3.8	Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance! And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones! 
LUK.3.9	And even now the ax is positioned at the root of the trees; therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.” 
LUK.3.10	And the crowds were asking him, saying, “What then should we do?” 
LUK.3.11	And he answered and
LUK.3.12	And tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what should we do?” 
LUK.3.13	And he said to them, “Collect no more than what you are ordered to.”
LUK.3.14	And those who served in the army were also asking him, saying, “What should we also do?” And he said to them, “Extort from no one, and do not blackmail anyone,
LUK.3.15	And while
LUK.3.16	John answered them all, saying, “I baptize you with water, but the one who is more powerful than I am is coming, of whom I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 
LUK.3.17	His winnowing shovel is in his hand, to clean out his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” 
LUK.3.18	So with many other exhortations also he proclaimed good news to the people. 
LUK.3.19	But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him concerning Herodias, his brother’s wife, and concerning all the evil deeds that Herod had done, 
LUK.3.20	added this also to them all: he also locked up John in prison. 
LUK.3.21	Now it happened that when all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized, and while he
LUK.3.22	and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.” 
LUK.3.23	And Jesus, when he
LUK.3.24	the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, 
LUK.3.25	the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, 
LUK.3.26	the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, 
LUK.3.27	the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, 
LUK.3.28	the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, 
LUK.3.29	the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, 
LUK.3.30	the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, 
LUK.3.31	the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, 
LUK.3.32	the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Sala, the son of Nahshon, 
LUK.3.33	the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, 
LUK.3.34	the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, 
LUK.3.35	the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,
LUK.3.36	the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, 
LUK.3.37	the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, 
LUK.3.38	the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God. 
LUK.4.1	 And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness 
LUK.4.2	forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days, and when
LUK.4.3	So the devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, order this stone that it become bread!” 
LUK.4.4	And Jesus replied to him, “It is written, ‘Man will not live on bread alone.’ ”
LUK.4.5	And he led him up and
LUK.4.6	And the devil said to him, “I will give you all this domain and their glory, because it has been handed over to me, and I can give it to whomever I want. 
LUK.4.7	So if you will worship before me, all this will be yours.” 
LUK.4.8	And Jesus answered and
LUK.4.9	And he brought him to Jerusalem, and had him stand on the highest point of the temple and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, 
LUK.4.10	for it is written, 
LUK.4.10	‘He will command his angels concerning you, 
LUK.4.10	to protect you,’
LUK.4.11	and 
LUK.4.11	‘on their hands they will lift you up, 
LUK.4.11	lest you strike your foot against a stone.’ ”
LUK.4.12	And Jesus answered and
LUK.4.13	And when
LUK.4.14	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news about him went out throughout all the surrounding region. 
LUK.4.15	And he began to teach
LUK.4.16	And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up,
LUK.4.17	And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him, and unrolling the scroll he found the place where it was written, 
LUK.4.18	“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, 
LUK.4.18	because of which he has anointed me 
LUK.4.18	to proclaim good news to the poor. 
LUK.4.18	He has sent me 
LUK.4.18	to proclaim release to the captives, 
LUK.4.18	and recovery of sight to the blind, 
LUK.4.18	to send out in freedom those who are oppressed, 
LUK.4.19	to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord.”
LUK.4.20	And he rolled up the scroll and
LUK.4.21	And he began to say to them, “Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.” 
LUK.4.22	And they were all speaking well of him, and were astonished at the gracious words that were coming out of his mouth. And they were saying, “Is this man not the son of Joseph?” 
LUK.4.23	And he said to them, “Doubtless you will tell me this parable: ‘Physician, heal yourself!’ Whatever we have heard that took place in Capernaum, do here in your hometown also!” 
LUK.4.24	And he said, “Truly I say to you that no prophet is acceptable in his own hometown. 
LUK.4.25	But in truth I say to you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut for three years and six months while a great famine took place over all the land. 
LUK.4.26	And Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath in the region of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. 
LUK.4.27	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was made clean except Naaman the Syrian.” 
LUK.4.28	And all those in the synagogue were filled with anger when they
LUK.4.29	And they stood up and
LUK.4.30	But he passed through their midst and
LUK.4.31	And he came down to Capernaum, a town of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbath. 
LUK.4.32	And they were astounded at his teaching, because he spoke
LUK.4.33	And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon,
LUK.4.34	“Ha! Leave us alone,
LUK.4.35	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent and come out of him!” And after
LUK.4.36	And amazement came upon them all, and they began to talk
LUK.4.37	And news about him went out into every place of the surrounding region. 
LUK.4.38	And after he
LUK.4.39	And he stood over her and
LUK.4.40	Now as
LUK.4.41	And demons also were coming out of many, crying out and saying, “You are the Son of God!” And he rebuked them
LUK.4.42	And when it
LUK.4.43	But he said to them, “It is necessary for me to proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because I was sent for this purpose. 
LUK.4.44	And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea. 
LUK.5.1	 Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around him and hearing the word of God, he was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret,
LUK.5.2	and he saw two boats there beside the lake, but the fishermen had gotten out of them and
LUK.5.3	And he got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and
LUK.5.4	And when he stopped speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.” 
LUK.5.5	And Simon answered and
LUK.5.6	And when they
LUK.5.7	And they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and
LUK.5.8	And when he
LUK.5.9	For amazement had seized him and all those who were with him at the catch of fish that they had caught, 
LUK.5.10	and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were business partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid! From now on you will be catching people!” 
LUK.5.11	And after they
LUK.5.12	And it happened that while he was in one of the towns, there was
LUK.5.13	And extending his
LUK.5.14	And he ordered him, “Tell no one, but go and
LUK.5.15	But the report about him spread even more, and large crowds were gathering to hear him
LUK.5.16	But he himself was withdrawing in the wilderness and praying. 
LUK.5.17	And it happened that on one of the days as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there who had come
LUK.5.18	And behold, men came carrying on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and place him
LUK.5.19	And when they
LUK.5.20	And when he
LUK.5.21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this man who speaks blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?” 
LUK.5.22	But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered and
LUK.5.23	Which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’ 
LUK.5.24	But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” he said to the one who was paralyzed, “I say to you, ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and
LUK.5.25	And immediately he stood up before them, picked up what he had been lying on, and
LUK.5.26	And amazement seized them all, and they began to glorify
LUK.5.27	And after these things, he went out and saw a tax collector named
LUK.5.28	And leaving everything behind, he got up and
LUK.5.29	And Levi gave a great banquet for him in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining for the meal with them. 
LUK.5.30	And the Pharisees and their scribes began to complain
LUK.5.31	And Jesus answered and
LUK.5.32	I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.” 
LUK.5.33	And they said to him, “The disciples of John fast often and make prayers—likewise also the disciples
LUK.5.34	So he
LUK.5.35	But days will come, and when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.” 
LUK.5.36	And he also told a parable to them: “No one tears a patch from a new garment and
LUK.5.37	And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be spilled and the wineskins will be destroyed. 
LUK.5.38	But new wine must be put into new wineskins. 
LUK.5.39	And no one after
LUK.6.1	 Now it happened that on a Sabbath he went through the grain fields, and his disciples were picking and eating the heads of grain, rubbing them
LUK.6.2	But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath? 
LUK.6.3	And Jesus answered and
LUK.6.4	how he entered into the house of God and took the bread of the presentation, which it is not permitted to eat (except the priests alone), and
LUK.6.5	And he said to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.” 
LUK.6.6	Now it happened that on another Sabbath he entered into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there, and his right hand was withered. 
LUK.6.7	So the scribes and the Pharisees were watching closely
LUK.6.8	But he knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand, “Get up and stand in the middle,” and he got up and
LUK.6.9	And Jesus said to them, “I ask you whether it is permitted on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save a life or to destroy it?”
LUK.6.10	And after
LUK.6.11	But they were filled with fury, and began discussing
LUK.6.12	Now it happened that in these days he went away to the mountain to pray, and was spending the whole night in prayer to God. 
LUK.6.13	And when day came, he summoned his disciples and chose from them twelve, whom he also named apostles: 
LUK.6.14	Simon (whom he also named Peter) and his brother Andrew, and James, and John, and Philip, and Bartholomew, 
LUK.6.15	and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot, 
LUK.6.16	and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. 
LUK.6.17	And he came down with them and
LUK.6.18	who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases, and those who were troubled by unclean spirits were cured. 
LUK.6.19	And the whole crowd was seeking to touch him, because power was going out from him and healing them all. 
LUK.6.20	And he lifted up his eyes to his disciples and
LUK.6.20	“Blessed are the poor, 
LUK.6.20	because yours is the kingdom of God. 
LUK.6.21	Blessed are those who are hungry now, 
LUK.6.21	because you will be satisfied. 
LUK.6.21	Blessed are those who weep now, 
LUK.6.21	Because you will laugh. 
LUK.6.22	Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil on account of the Son of Man. 
LUK.6.23	Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For their fathers used to do the same things to the prophets. 
LUK.6.24	“But woe to you who are rich, 
LUK.6.24	because you have received your comfort. 
LUK.6.25	Woe to you who are satisfied now, 
LUK.6.25	because you will be hungry. 
LUK.6.25	Woe, you who laugh now, 
LUK.6.25	because you will mourn and weep. 
LUK.6.26	Woe whenever all people speak well of you, 
LUK.6.26	for their fathers used to do the same things to the false prophets. 
LUK.6.27	“But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 
LUK.6.28	bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. 
LUK.6.29	To the one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also, and from the one who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic also. 
LUK.6.30	Give to everyone who asks you, and from the one who takes away your things, do not ask for them back.
LUK.6.31	And just as you want people to do
LUK.6.32	“And if you love those who love you, what kind of credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them! 
LUK.6.33	And if
LUK.6.34	And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive back, what kind of credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, so that they may get back an equal amount! 
LUK.6.35	But love your enemies, and do good, and lend expecting back nothing, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. 
LUK.6.36	Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful!
LUK.6.37	“And do not judge, and you will never be judged. And do not condemn, and you will never be condemned. Pardon, and you will be pardoned. 
LUK.6.38	Give, and it will be given to you, a good measure—pressed down, shaken, overflowing—they will pour out into your lap. For with the measure by which you measure out, it will be measured out to you in return.” 
LUK.6.39	And he also told them a parable: “Surely a blind person cannot lead the blind, can he?
LUK.6.40	A disciple is not superior to his
LUK.6.41	And why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the beam of wood that is in your own eye? 
LUK.6.42	How are you able to say to your brother, “Brother, allow me to remove the speck that is in your eye,” while
LUK.6.43	“For there is no good tree that produces bad fruit, nor on the other hand a bad tree that produces good fruit, 
LUK.6.44	for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorn plants, nor are grapes harvested from thorn bushes. 
LUK.6.45	The good person out of the good treasury of his heart brings forth good, and the evil person out of his
LUK.6.46	“And why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I tell you?
LUK.6.47	“Everyone who comes to me and listens to my words and does them—I will show you what he is like: 
LUK.6.48	he is like a man building a house, who dug and went down deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when
LUK.6.49	But the one who hears my words
LUK.7.1	 After he had finished all his statements in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum. 
LUK.7.2	Now a certain centurion’s slave, who was esteemed by him, was sick
LUK.7.3	So when he
LUK.7.4	And when they
LUK.7.5	because he loves our nation and he himself built the synagogue for us.” 
LUK.7.6	So Jesus went with them. Now by this time he was not far away from the house, and
LUK.7.7	For this reason neither did I consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word and my slave must be healed. 
LUK.7.8	For I also am a man placed under authority, who has soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another one, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”
LUK.7.9	And when
LUK.7.10	And when they
LUK.7.11	And it happened that on the next day he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went with him. 
LUK.7.12	And as he approached the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, his mother’s only son, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. 
LUK.7.13	And when
LUK.7.14	And he came up and
LUK.7.15	And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and he gave him to his mother. 
LUK.7.16	And fear seized them all, and they began to glorify
LUK.7.17	And this report about him went out in the whole of Judea and in all the surrounding region. 
LUK.7.18	And his disciples reported to John about all these things. And summoning a certain two of his disciples, John 
LUK.7.19	sent them
LUK.7.20	And when
LUK.7.21	In that hour he healed many people of diseases and suffering and evil spirits, and he granted sight to many blind people. 
LUK.7.22	And he answered and
LUK.7.23	And whoever is not offended by me is blessed.” 
LUK.7.24	And when
LUK.7.25	But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are in splendid clothing and luxury are in the royal palaces. 
LUK.7.26	But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet! 
LUK.7.27	It is this man about whom it is written: 
LUK.7.27	‘Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, 
LUK.7.27	who will prepare your way before you.’
LUK.7.28	I tell you, there is no one greater among those born of women than John, but the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. 
LUK.7.29	(And all the people, when they
LUK.7.30	but the Pharisees and the legal experts rejected the purpose of God for themselves, because they
LUK.7.31	“To what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like? 
LUK.7.32	They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another, who say, 
LUK.7.32	‘We played the flute for you and you did not dance; 
LUK.7.32	we sang a lament and you did not weep.’ 
LUK.7.33	For John the Baptist has come not eating bread or drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’ 
LUK.7.34	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a man who is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ 
LUK.7.35	And wisdom is vindicated by all her children.” 
LUK.7.36	Now one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he entered into the house of the Pharisee and
LUK.7.37	And behold, a woman in the town who was a sinner, when she
LUK.7.38	and standing behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and was wiping them
LUK.7.39	Now when
LUK.7.40	And Jesus answered and
LUK.7.41	“There were two debtors who owed a certain creditor. One owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty. 
LUK.7.42	When
LUK.7.43	Simon answered and
LUK.7.44	And turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house. You did not give me water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them
LUK.7.45	You did not give me a kiss, but from the time I entered, she has not stopped kissing my feet. 
LUK.7.46	You did not anoint my head with olive oil, but she anointed my feet with perfumed oil. 
LUK.7.47	For this reason
LUK.7.48	And he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” 
LUK.7.49	And those who were reclining at the table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” 
LUK.7.50	And he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.” 
LUK.8.1	 And it happened that afterward
LUK.8.2	and some women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (who was called Magdalene), from whom seven demons had gone out, 
LUK.8.3	and Joanna the wife of Chuza (Herod’s household manager), and Susanna, and many others who were helping to support them from their possessions. 
LUK.8.4	And while
LUK.8.5	“The sower went out to sow his seed, and while he was sowing, some seed
LUK.8.6	And other seed fell on the rock, and when it
LUK.8.7	And other seed fell in the midst of the thorn plants, and the thorn plants grew up with it
LUK.8.8	And other seed fell on the good soil, and when it
LUK.8.9	And his disciples asked him what this parable meant. 
LUK.8.10	And he said, “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest they are in parables, so that 
LUK.8.10	‘Seeing they may not see, 
LUK.8.10	and hearing they may not understand.’
LUK.8.11	Now the parable means this: the seed is the word of God, 
LUK.8.12	and those beside the path are the ones who have heard. Then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and
LUK.8.13	And those on the rock are those who receive the word with joy when they hear it,
LUK.8.14	And the seed that fell into the thorn plants—these are the ones who hear and as they
LUK.8.15	But the seed on the good soil—these are the ones who, after
LUK.8.16	“And no one, after
LUK.8.17	For nothing is secret that will not become evident, and nothing hidden that will never be known and come to light. 
LUK.8.18	Therefore consider how you listen, for whoever has, to him more will be given, and whoever does not have, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away from him.” 
LUK.8.19	Now his mother and brothers came to him, and they were not able to meet with him because of the crowd. 
LUK.8.20	And it was reported to him, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you.” 
LUK.8.21	But he answered and
LUK.8.22	Now it happened that on one of the days both he and his disciples got into a boat, and he said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side of the lake.” And they set sail, 
LUK.8.23	and as
LUK.8.24	And they came and
LUK.8.25	And he said to them, “Where is your faith?” But they were afraid and
LUK.8.26	And they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. 
LUK.8.27	And as
LUK.8.28	And when he
LUK.8.29	For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For it had seized him many times, and he was bound with chains and shackles and
LUK.8.30	So Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Legion,” because many demons had entered into him. 
LUK.8.31	And they began imploring
LUK.8.32	Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding there on the hill, and they implored him that he would permit them to enter into those pigs. And he permitted them. 
LUK.8.33	So the demons came out of the man and
LUK.8.34	And when
LUK.8.35	So they went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting there clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus, and they were afraid. 
LUK.8.36	And those who had seen it
LUK.8.37	And all the people of the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, because they had been seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and
LUK.8.38	And the man from who the demons had gone out was begging him to stay with him, but he sent him away, saying, 
LUK.8.39	“Return to your home and tell all that God has done for you.” And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole town all that Jesus had done for him. 
LUK.8.40	Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, because they were all waiting for him. 
LUK.8.41	And behold, a man who was named
LUK.8.42	because he had
LUK.8.42	Now as he was going, the crowds were pressing against him. 
LUK.8.43	And a woman who was suffering from hemorrhages
LUK.8.44	came up behind him and
LUK.8.45	And Jesus said, “Who is the one who touched me?” And when they
LUK.8.46	But Jesus said, “Someone touched me, because I know power has gone out from me.” 
LUK.8.47	And when
LUK.8.48	And he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has saved you. Go in peace.” 
LUK.8.49	While
LUK.8.50	But Jesus, when he
LUK.8.51	Now when he
LUK.8.52	And they were all weeping and mourning for her, but he said, “Do not weep! For she is not dead, but is sleeping.” 
LUK.8.53	And they began laughing
LUK.8.54	But he took her hand and
LUK.8.55	And her spirit returned, and she got up immediately, and he ordered something
LUK.8.56	And her parents were astonished, but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened. 
LUK.9.1	 And summoning the twelve, he gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases, 
LUK.9.2	and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. 
LUK.9.3	And he said to them, “Take along nothing for the journey—neither a staff, nor a traveler’s bag, nor bread, nor money, nor to have two tunics apiece. 
LUK.9.4	And into whatever house you enter, stay there and depart from there. 
LUK.9.5	And as for all those who do not welcome you—when you
LUK.9.6	So they departed and
LUK.9.7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John has been raised from the dead, 
LUK.9.8	and by some that Elijah had appeared, and others that some prophet of ancient times had risen. 
LUK.9.9	And Herod said, “John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” And he was wanting to see him. 
LUK.9.10	And when they
LUK.9.11	But when
LUK.9.12	Now the day began to be far spent, and the twelve came up and
LUK.9.13	But he said to them, “You give them something to eat!” And they said, “We have no
LUK.9.14	(For there were about five thousand men.) So he said to his disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.” 
LUK.9.15	And they did so, and had them all sit down. 
LUK.9.16	And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and
LUK.9.17	And they all ate and were satisfied, and what was left over was picked up by them—twelve baskets of broken pieces. 
LUK.9.18	And it happened that while he was praying alone, the disciples were with him. And he asked them, saying, “Who do the crowds say that I am?” 
LUK.9.19	And they answered and
LUK.9.20	And he said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” And Peter answered and
LUK.9.21	But he warned and
LUK.9.22	saying, “It is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised on the third day. 
LUK.9.23	And he said to them all, “If anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross every day and follow me. 
LUK.9.24	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of me, this person will save it. 
LUK.9.25	For what is a person benefited if he
LUK.9.26	For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of this person when he comes in his glory and the glory
LUK.9.27	But I tell you truly, there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the kingdom of God.” 
LUK.9.28	Now it happened that about eight days after these words, he took along Peter and John and James and
LUK.9.29	And as he was praying, the appearance of his face became different, and his clothing became white, gleaming like lightning.
LUK.9.30	And behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah, 
LUK.9.31	who appeared in glory and
LUK.9.32	Now Peter and those with him were very sleepy,
LUK.9.33	And it happened that as they were going away from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he was saying. 
LUK.9.34	And while
LUK.9.35	And a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen One. Listen to him!” 
LUK.9.36	And after the voice had occurred, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen. 
LUK.9.37	Now it happened that on the next day, when
LUK.9.38	And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look with concern on my son, because he is my only son! 
LUK.9.39	And behold, a spirit seizes him and suddenly he screams, and it convulses him with foam and rarely withdraws from him, battering him severely. 
LUK.9.40	And I begged your disciples that they would expel it, and they were not able to do so.” 
LUK.9.41	So Jesus answered and
LUK.9.42	And while
LUK.9.43	And they were all astounded at the impressiveness of God. 
LUK.9.43	But while they
LUK.9.44	“You take these words to heart,
LUK.9.45	But they did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they could not understand it. And they were afraid to ask him about this statement. 
LUK.9.46	And an argument developed among them as to who of them might be greatest. 
LUK.9.47	But Jesus, because he
LUK.9.48	and said to them, “Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For the one who is least among you all—this one is great.” 
LUK.9.49	And John answered and
LUK.9.50	But Jesus said to him, “Do not prevent him,
LUK.9.51	Now it happened that when the days were approaching for him to be taken up,
LUK.9.52	And he sent messengers before him,
LUK.9.53	And they did not welcome him because he was determined to go
LUK.9.54	Now when
LUK.9.55	But he turned around and
LUK.9.56	and they proceeded to another village. 
LUK.9.57	And as
LUK.9.58	And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his
LUK.9.59	And he said to another, “Follow me!” But he said, “Lord, first allow me to go and
LUK.9.60	But he said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead! But you go and
LUK.9.61	And another person also said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say farewell to those in my house.” 
LUK.9.62	But Jesus said,
LUK.10.1	 And after these things, the Lord also
LUK.10.2	And he said to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest that he send out workers into his harvest. 
LUK.10.3	Go! Behold, I am sending you out like lambs in the midst of wolves! 
LUK.10.4	Do not carry a money bag or a traveler’s bag or sandals, and greet no one along the road. 
LUK.10.5	And into whatever house you enter, first say, “Peace be to this household!” 
LUK.10.6	And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him. But if not, it will return to you. 
LUK.10.7	And remain in the same house, eating and drinking whatever they provide,
LUK.10.8	And into whatever town you enter and they welcome you, eat whatever is
LUK.10.9	and heal the sick in it, and say to them, “The kingdom of God has come near to you.” 
LUK.10.10	But into whatever town you enter and they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and
LUK.10.11	“Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you! Nevertheless know this: that the kingdom of God has come near!”
LUK.10.12	I tell you that it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town! 
LUK.10.13	Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes! 
LUK.10.14	But it will be more bearable for Tyre and for Sidon in the judgment than for you! 
LUK.10.15	And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to Hades! 
LUK.10.16	The one who listens to you listens to me, and the one who rejects you rejects me. But the one who rejects me rejects the one who sent me.” 
LUK.10.17	And the seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!” 
LUK.10.18	So he said to them, “I saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven. 
LUK.10.19	Behold, I have given you the authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will ever harm you. 
LUK.10.20	Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are inscribed in heaven.” 
LUK.10.21	At that same time he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to young children. Yes, Father, for this was pleasing before you. 
LUK.10.22	All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father and who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wants to reveal him.”
LUK.10.23	And turning to the disciples, he said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see the things which you see! 
LUK.10.24	For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and did not see them,
LUK.10.25	And behold, a certain legal expert stood up to test him, saying, “Teacher, what must I do so that I will inherit eternal life?” 
LUK.10.26	And he said to him, “What is written in the law? How do you read it?”
LUK.10.27	And he answered and
LUK.10.28	And he said to him, “You have answered correctly. Do this and you will live.” 
LUK.10.29	But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” 
LUK.10.30	And
LUK.10.31	Now by coincidence a certain priest was going down on that road, and when he
LUK.10.32	And in the same way also a Levite, when he
LUK.10.33	But a certain Samaritan who was traveling came up to him and, when he
LUK.10.34	And he came up and
LUK.10.35	And on the next day, he took out two denarii and
LUK.10.36	Which of these three do you suppose became a neighbor of the man who fell among the robbers?” 
LUK.10.37	So he said, “The one who showed mercy to him.” And Jesus said to him, “You go and do likewise.” 
LUK.10.38	Now as they traveled along, he entered into a certain village. And a certain woman named
LUK.10.39	And she had
LUK.10.40	But Martha was distracted with much preparation, so she approached and
LUK.10.41	But the Lord answered and
LUK.10.42	But few things are necessary, or only one thing,
LUK.11.1	 And it happened that while he was in a certain place praying, when he stopped a certain one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.” 
LUK.11.2	And he said to them, “When you pray, say, 
LUK.11.2	“Father, 
LUK.11.2	may your name be treated as holy. 
LUK.11.2	May your kingdom come. 
LUK.11.3	Give us each day our daily bread. 
LUK.11.4	And forgive us our sins, 
LUK.11.4	for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. 
LUK.11.4	And do not lead us into temptation.” 
LUK.11.5	And he said to them, “Who of you will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves, 
LUK.11.6	because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey, and I do not have anything to set before him.’ 
LUK.11.7	And that one will answer from inside and
LUK.11.8	I tell you, even if he does not give him anything
LUK.11.9	And I tell you, ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened for you. 
LUK.11.10	For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. 
LUK.11.11	But what father from among you, if his
LUK.11.12	Or also, if he will ask for an egg, will give him a scorpion? 
LUK.11.13	Therefore if you, although you
LUK.11.14	And he was expelling a mute demon.
LUK.11.15	But some of them said, “By Beelzebul the ruler of demons he expels demons!” 
LUK.11.16	And others, in order to
LUK.11.17	But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household
LUK.11.18	So if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I expel demons by Beelzebul. 
LUK.11.19	But if I expel demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons expel them?
LUK.11.20	But if I expel demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you! 
LUK.11.21	When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his possessions are safe.
LUK.11.22	But when a stronger man attacks him and
LUK.11.23	The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters. 
LUK.11.24	“Whenever an unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it travels through waterless places searching for rest, and does not find it.
LUK.11.25	And when it
LUK.11.26	Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and
LUK.11.27	Now it happened that as he said these things, a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and
LUK.11.28	But he said, “On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God and follow it!”
LUK.11.29	And as
LUK.11.30	For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation. 
LUK.11.31	The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something
LUK.11.32	The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah, and behold, something
LUK.11.33	“No one after
LUK.11.34	Your eye is the lamp of the body. When your eye is sincere, your whole body is full of light also. But when it is evil, your body is dark also. 
LUK.11.35	Therefore pay careful attention that the light in you is not darkness! 
LUK.11.36	If therefore your whole body is full of light, not having any part dark, it will be completely full of light, as when the lamp with its light gives light to you.” 
LUK.11.37	And as he was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to have a meal
LUK.11.38	And the Pharisee, when he
LUK.11.39	But the Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but your inside is full of greediness and wickedness. 
LUK.11.40	Fools! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also? 
LUK.11.41	But give as charitable giving the things that are within, and behold, everything is clean for you. 
LUK.11.42	“But woe to you, Pharisees, because you pay a tenth of mint and rue and every garden herb, and neglect justice and love for God! But it was necessary to do these things without neglecting those things also. 
LUK.11.43	Woe to you, Pharisees, because you love the best seat in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces! 
LUK.11.44	Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, and the people who walk over them
LUK.11.45	And one of the legal experts answered and
LUK.11.46	So he said, “Woe to you also, legal experts, because you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers! 
LUK.11.47	Woe to you, because you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them! 
LUK.11.48	As a result you are witnesses, and you approve of the deeds of your fathers, because they killed them and you build their tombs!
LUK.11.49	For this reason also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute,’ 
LUK.11.50	so that the blood of all the prophets that has been shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation, 
LUK.11.51	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the temple building.
LUK.11.52	Woe to you, legal experts, because you have taken away the key to knowledge! You did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering!” 
LUK.11.53	And when
LUK.11.54	plotting to catch him with reference to something he might say.
LUK.12.1	 During this time
LUK.12.2	But nothing is concealed that will not be revealed, and secret that will not be made known. 
LUK.12.3	Therefore everything that you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered
LUK.12.4	“And I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after these things do not have anything more to do. 
LUK.12.5	But I will show you whom you should fear: fear the one who has authority, after the killing, to throw you
LUK.12.6	Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God. 
LUK.12.7	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered! Do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. 
LUK.12.8	“And I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before people, the Son of Man also will acknowledge him before the angels of God, 
LUK.12.9	but the one who denies me before people will be denied before the angels of God. 
LUK.12.10	And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him, but to the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven. 
LUK.12.11	But when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious how or what you should speak in your own defense or what you should say, 
LUK.12.12	for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what it is necessary to say.” 
LUK.12.13	Now someone from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me!” 
LUK.12.14	But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?” 
LUK.12.15	And he said to them, “Watch out and guard yourselves from all greediness, because not even when someone has an abundance does
LUK.12.16	And he told a parable to them, saying, “The land of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. 
LUK.12.17	And he reasoned to himself, saying, ‘What should I do? For I do not have anywhere I can gather in my crops.’ 
LUK.12.18	And he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and I will gather in there all my grain and possessions. 
LUK.12.19	And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have many possessions stored up for many years. Relax, eat, drink, celebrate!” ’ 
LUK.12.20	But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your life
LUK.12.21	So is the one who stores up treasure for himself, and who is not rich toward God!” 
LUK.12.22	And he said to his disciples, “For this reason I tell you, do not be anxious for your
LUK.12.23	For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. 
LUK.12.24	Consider the ravens, that they neither sow nor reap; to them there is neither storeroom nor barn, and God feeds them. How much more are you worth than the birds? 
LUK.12.25	And which of you by
LUK.12.26	If then you are not even able to do a very little thing, why are you anxious about the rest? 
LUK.12.27	Consider the lilies, how they grow: they do not toil or spin, but I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these. 
LUK.12.28	But if God clothes the grass in the field in this way, although it
LUK.12.29	And you, do not consider what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not be anxious. 
LUK.12.30	For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need these things. 
LUK.12.31	But seek his kingdom and these things will be added to you. 
LUK.12.32	“Do not be afraid, little flock, because your Father is well pleased to give you the kingdom. 
LUK.12.33	Sell your possessions and give charitable gifts. Make for yourselves money bags that do not wear out, an inexhaustible treasure in heaven
LUK.12.34	For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. 
LUK.12.35	“You must be prepared for action
LUK.12.36	And you, be like people who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast,
LUK.12.37	Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find on the alert when he returns! Truly I say to you that he will dress himself for service and have them recline at the table and will come by and
LUK.12.38	Even if he should come back in the second or in the third watch of the night and find them
LUK.12.39	But understand this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into. 
LUK.12.40	You also must be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think he will come.”
LUK.12.41	And Peter said, “Lord, are you telling this parable for us, or also for everyone?” 
LUK.12.42	And the Lord said, “Who then is the faithful wise manager whom the master will put in charge over his servants to give them
LUK.12.43	Blessed is that slave whom his master will find so doing when he
LUK.12.44	Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions. 
LUK.12.45	But if that slave should say to himself,
LUK.12.46	the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know, and will cut him in two and assign his place with the unbelievers. 
LUK.12.47	And that slave who knew the will of his master and did not prepare or do according to his will will be given a severe beating.
LUK.12.48	But the one who did not know and did things deserving blows will be given a light beating.
LUK.12.49	“I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish that it had been kindled already! 
LUK.12.50	But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am distressed until it is accomplished! 
LUK.12.51	Do you think that I have come to grant peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division! 
LUK.12.52	For from now on there will be five in one household, divided three against two and two against three. 
LUK.12.53	They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.” 
LUK.12.54	And he also said to the crowds, “When you see a cloud coming up in the west, you say at once, ‘A rainstorm is coming,’ and so it happens. 
LUK.12.55	And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, ‘There will be burning heat,’ and it happens. 
LUK.12.56	Hypocrites! You know how to evaluate the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it you do not know how to evaluate this present time? 
LUK.12.57	And why do you not also judge for yourselves what is right? 
LUK.12.58	For as you are going with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort to come to a settlement with him on the way, so that he will not drag you to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the bailiff, and the bailiff will throw you into prison. 
LUK.12.59	I tell you, you will never get out of there until you have paid back even the last cent!”
LUK.13.1	 Now at the same time some had come to tell him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 
LUK.13.2	And he answered and
LUK.13.3	No, I tell you, but unless you repent you will all perish as well! 
LUK.13.4	Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them—do you think that they were sinners worse than all the people who live in Jerusalem? 
LUK.13.5	No, I tell you, but unless you repent, you will all perish as well!” 
LUK.13.6	And he told this parable: “A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any.
LUK.13.7	So he said to the gardener, ‘Behold, for three years
LUK.13.8	But he answered and
LUK.13.9	And if indeed it produces fruit in the coming year, so much the better,
LUK.13.10	Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. 
LUK.13.11	And behold, a woman was there
LUK.13.12	And when he
LUK.13.13	And he placed his
LUK.13.14	But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, answered and
LUK.13.15	But the Lord answered and said to him, “Hypocrites! Does not each one of you untie his ox or his
LUK.13.16	And this woman, who is a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound eighteen
LUK.13.17	And when
LUK.13.18	Therefore he said, “What is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I compare it? 
LUK.13.19	It is like a mustard seed that a man took and
LUK.13.20	And again he said, “To what shall I compare the kingdom of God? 
LUK.13.21	It is like yeast that a woman took and
LUK.13.22	And he was going throughout towns and villages, teaching and making his journey toward Jerusalem. 
LUK.13.23	And someone said to him, “Lord, are there only
LUK.13.24	“Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able to, 
LUK.13.25	when once the master of the house has gotten up and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door, saying, ‘Lord, open the door
LUK.13.26	Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets!’ 
LUK.13.27	And he will reply, saying to you, ‘I do not know where you are from! Go away from me, all you evildoers!’
LUK.13.28	In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves thrown outside! 
LUK.13.29	And they will come from east and west, and from north and south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God. 
LUK.13.30	And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.” 
LUK.13.31	At that same hour some Pharisees came up and
LUK.13.32	And he said to them, “Go and
LUK.13.33	Nevertheless, it is necessary for me to be on the way today and tomorrow and on the next day, because it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside Jerusalem. 
LUK.13.34	“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How many times I wanted to gather your children together the way
LUK.13.35	Behold, your house has been left to you! And I tell you, you will never see me until the time
LUK.14.1	 And it happened that when he came to the house of a certain one of the leaders of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat a meal,
LUK.14.2	And behold, a certain man was in front of him, suffering from edema. 
LUK.14.3	And Jesus answered and
LUK.14.4	But they remained silent. And he took hold of him
LUK.14.5	And he said to them, “Who among you, if your
LUK.14.6	And they were not able to make a reply to these things. 
LUK.14.7	Now he told a parable to those who had been invited when he
LUK.14.8	“When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast,
LUK.14.9	and the one who invited you both
LUK.14.10	But when you are invited, go and
LUK.14.11	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” 
LUK.14.12	And he also said to the one who had invited him, “When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or wealthy neighbors, lest they also invite you in return, and repayment come to you. 
LUK.14.13	But whenever you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, 
LUK.14.14	and you will be blessed, because they are not able to repay you. For it will be paid back to you at the resurrection of the righteous.” 
LUK.14.15	Now when
LUK.14.16	But he said to him, “A certain man was giving a large banquet and invited many. 
LUK.14.17	And he sent his slave at the hour of the banquet to say to those who have been invited, ‘Come, because now it is ready!’ 
LUK.14.18	And they all alike
LUK.14.19	And another said, ‘I have purchased five yoke of oxen, and I am going to examine them. I ask you, consider me excused.’ 
LUK.14.20	And another said, ‘I have married a wife, and for this reason I am not able to come.’ 
LUK.14.21	And the slave came and
LUK.14.22	And the slave said, ‘Sir, what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.’ 
LUK.14.23	And the master said to the slave, ‘Go out into the highways and hedges and press them
LUK.14.24	For I say to you that none of those persons who were invited will taste my banquet!’ ” 
LUK.14.25	Now large crowds were going along with him, and he turned around and
LUK.14.26	“If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and furthermore, even his own life, he cannot be
LUK.14.27	Whoever does not carry his own cross and follow
LUK.14.28	For which of you, wanting to build a tower, does not first sit down and
LUK.14.29	Otherwise
LUK.14.30	saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish!’ 
LUK.14.31	Or what king, going out to engage another king in battle, does not sit down first and
LUK.14.32	But if not, while
LUK.14.33	In the same way, therefore, every one of you who does not renounce all his own possessions cannot be
LUK.14.34	“Now salt is good, but if salt becomes tasteless, with what will it be made salty? 
LUK.14.35	It is usable neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; they throw it out. The one who has ears to hear, let him hear!” 
LUK.15.1	 Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were drawing near to hear him. 
LUK.15.2	And both the Pharisees and the scribes were complaining, saying, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them!” 
LUK.15.3	So he told them this parable, saying, 
LUK.15.4	“What man of you, having a hundred sheep and losing one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the grassland and go after the one that was lost until he finds it? 
LUK.15.5	And when he
LUK.15.6	And when he
LUK.15.7	I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance. 
LUK.15.8	Or what woman who has ten drachmas, if she loses one drachma, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?
LUK.15.9	And when she
LUK.15.10	In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.” 
LUK.15.11	And he said, “A certain man had two sons. 
LUK.15.12	And the younger of them said to his
LUK.15.13	And after not many days, the younger son gathered everything and
LUK.15.14	And after
LUK.15.15	And he went and
LUK.15.16	And he was longing to fill his stomach with
LUK.15.17	“But when he
LUK.15.18	I will set out and
LUK.15.19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son! Make me like one of your hired workers.’ 
LUK.15.20	And he set out and
LUK.15.21	And his
LUK.15.22	But his
LUK.15.23	And bring the fattened calf—kill it
LUK.15.24	because this son of mine was dead, and is alive again! He was lost and is found!’ And they began to celebrate. 
LUK.15.25	“Now his older son was in the field, and when he came and
LUK.15.26	And he summoned one of the slaves and
LUK.15.27	And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has gotten him back healthy.’ 
LUK.15.28	But he became angry and did not want to go in. So his father came out and
LUK.15.29	But he answered and
LUK.15.30	But when this son of yours returned—who has consumed your assets with prostitutes—you killed the fattened calf for him!’ 
LUK.15.31	But he said to him, ‘Child, you are always with me, and everything I have belongs to you.
LUK.15.32	But it was necessary to celebrate and to rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead, and is alive, and was lost, and is found!’ ” 
LUK.16.1	 And he also said to the disciples, “A certain man was rich, who had a manager. And charges were brought to him that this person was squandering his possessions. 
LUK.16.2	And he summoned him and
LUK.16.3	And the manager said to himself, ‘What should I do, because my master is taking away the management from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg. 
LUK.16.4	I know what I should do, so that when I am removed from the management they will welcome me into their homes!’ 
LUK.16.5	And he summoned each one of his own master’s debtors and
LUK.16.6	And he said, ‘A hundred measures of olive oil.’ So he said to him, ‘Take your promissory note and sit down quickly and
LUK.16.7	Then he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ And he said, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your promissory note and write eighty.’ 
LUK.16.8	And the master praised the dishonest manager, because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of this age are shrewder than the sons of light with regard to their own generation.
LUK.16.9	And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it runs out they will welcome you into the eternal dwellings. 
LUK.16.10	“The one who is faithful in very little is also faithful in much, and the one who is dishonest in very little is also dishonest in much. 
LUK.16.11	If then you have not been faithful with unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?
LUK.16.12	And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you your own? 
LUK.16.13	No domestic slave is able to serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and will despise the other. You are not able to serve God and money.” 
LUK.16.14	Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him. 
LUK.16.15	And he said to them, “You are the ones who justify themselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts! For what is considered exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. 
LUK.16.16	“The law and the prophets were until John; from that time on the kingdom of God has been proclaimed, and everyone is urgently pressed
LUK.16.17	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the law to become invalid. 
LUK.16.18	“Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and the one who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery. 
LUK.16.19	“Now a certain man was rich, and dressed in purple cloth and fine linen, feasting sumptuously every day. 
LUK.16.20	And a certain poor man named
LUK.16.21	and was longing to be filled with what fell from the table of the rich man. But even the dogs came and
LUK.16.22	Now it happened that the poor man died, and he was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s side.
LUK.16.23	And in Hades he lifted up his eyes as he
LUK.16.24	And he called out and
LUK.16.25	But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that you received your good things during your life, and Lazarus likewise bad things. But now he is comforted here, but you are suffering pain. 
LUK.16.26	And in addition to all these things, a great chasm has been established between us and you, so that those who want to cross over from here to you are not able to do so,
LUK.16.27	So he said, ‘Then I ask you, father, that you send him to my father’s house, 
LUK.16.28	for I have five brothers, so that he could warn them, in order that they also should not come to this place of torment!’ 
LUK.16.29	But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; they must listen to them.’ 
LUK.16.30	And he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent!’ 
LUK.16.31	But he said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone rises from the dead.’ ” 
LUK.17.1	 And he said to his disciples, “It is impossible for causes for stumbling not to come, but woe to him through whom they come! 
LUK.17.2	It would be better for him if a millstone
LUK.17.3	“Be concerned about yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him. 
LUK.17.4	And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times he returns to you saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.” 
LUK.17.5	And the apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” 
LUK.17.6	So the Lord said, “If you have faith like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you. 
LUK.17.7	“And which of you who has a slave plowing or shepherding sheep
LUK.17.8	Will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare something that I may eat, and dress yourself to serve me while I eat and drink, and after these things you will eat and drink.’ 
LUK.17.9	He will not be grateful
LUK.17.10	Thus you also, when you have done all the things you were ordered to do,
LUK.17.11	And it happened that while traveling toward Jerusalem, he was passing through the region between
LUK.17.12	And as
LUK.17.13	And they raised their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!” 
LUK.17.14	And when he
LUK.17.15	But one of them, when he
LUK.17.16	And he fell on his face at his feet, giving thanks to him. And he was a Samaritan. 
LUK.17.17	So Jesus answered and
LUK.17.18	Was no one found to turn back and
LUK.17.19	And he said to him, “Get up and
LUK.17.20	Now when he
LUK.17.21	nor will they say, ‘Behold, here it is!’ or ‘There!’ For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.” 
LUK.17.22	And he said to the disciples, “Days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.
LUK.17.23	And they will say to you, ‘Behold, there!’ ‘Behold, here!’
LUK.17.24	For just as the lightning shines forth, flashing from one place under heaven to another place under heaven, so the Son of Man will be in his day. 
LUK.17.25	But first it is necessary for him to suffer many things, and to be rejected by this generation. 
LUK.17.26	And just as it was in the days of Noah, so also it will be in the days of the Son of Man—
LUK.17.27	they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 
LUK.17.28	Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot—they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building. 
LUK.17.29	But on the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed them all. 
LUK.17.30	It will be just the same
LUK.17.31	On that day, whoever is on the housetop and his goods are in the house must not come down to take them away. And likewise the one who is in the field must not turn back 
LUK.17.32	Remember Lot’s wife! 
LUK.17.33	Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses it
LUK.17.34	I tell you that in that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left. 
LUK.17.35	There will be two women
LUK.17.37	And they answered and
LUK.18.1	 And he told them a parable to show that they must always pray and not be discouraged, 
LUK.18.2	saying, “There was a certain judge in a certain town who did not fear God and did not respect people. 
LUK.18.3	And there was a widow in that town, and she kept coming to him, saying, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary!’ 
LUK.18.4	And he was not willing for a time, but after these things he said to himself, ‘Even if I do not fear God or respect people, 
LUK.18.5	yet because this widow is causing trouble for me, I will grant her justice, so that she does not wear me down in the end by her
LUK.18.6	And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge is saying! 
LUK.18.7	And will not God surely see to it that justice is done
LUK.18.8	I tell you that he will see to it that justice is done
LUK.18.9	And he also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and looked down on everyone else:
LUK.18.10	“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 
LUK.18.11	The Pharisee stood and
LUK.18.12	I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all that I get.’ 
LUK.18.13	But the tax collector, standing far away, did not want even to raise his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ 
LUK.18.14	I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than that one! For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” 
LUK.18.15	Now they were bringing even their
LUK.18.16	But Jesus called them to himself, saying, “Allow the children to come to me, and do not forbid them, for to such belongs
LUK.18.17	Truly I say to you, whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a young child will never enter into it.” 
LUK.18.18	And a certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good Teacher, by
LUK.18.19	And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. 
LUK.18.20	You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’ ”
LUK.18.21	And he said, “All these I have observed from my
LUK.18.22	And when he
LUK.18.23	But when he
LUK.18.24	And Jesus took notice of him
LUK.18.25	For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God. 
LUK.18.26	So those who heard this
LUK.18.27	But he said, “What is impossible with men is possible with God.” 
LUK.18.28	And Peter said, “Behold, we have left all that is ours
LUK.18.29	And he said to them, “Truly I say to you that there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children on account of the kingdom of God, 
LUK.18.30	who will not receive many times more in this time and in the age to come, eternal life.” 
LUK.18.31	And taking aside the twelve, he said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written by the prophets with reference to the Son of Man will be accomplished. 
LUK.18.32	For he will be handed over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and mistreated and spit on, 
LUK.18.33	and after
LUK.18.34	And they understood none of these things, and this saying was concealed from them, and they did not comprehend the things that were said. 
LUK.18.35	Now it happened that as he drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting on the side of the road begging. 
LUK.18.36	And when he
LUK.18.37	And they told him, “Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.” 
LUK.18.38	And he called out, saying, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 
LUK.18.39	And those who were in front rebuked him, that he should be silent, but he cried out even more loudly,
LUK.18.40	So Jesus stopped and
LUK.18.41	“What do you want me to do for you?” And he said, “Lord, that I may regain my sight. 
LUK.18.42	And Jesus said to him, “Regain your sight! Your faith has saved you.” 
LUK.18.43	And immediately he regained his sight and began to follow
LUK.19.1	 And he entered and
LUK.19.2	And there was
LUK.19.3	And he was seeking to see Jesus—who he was—and he was not able to as a result of the crowd, because he was short in stature. 
LUK.19.4	And he ran on ahead and
LUK.19.5	And when he came to the place, Jesus looked up and
LUK.19.6	And he came down quickly and welcomed him joyfully. 
LUK.19.7	And when they
LUK.19.8	And Zacchaeus stopped and
LUK.19.9	And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham. 
LUK.19.10	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save those who are lost.” 
LUK.19.11	Now while
LUK.19.12	Therefore he said, “A certain nobleman traveled to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return. 
LUK.19.13	And summoning ten of his own slaves, he gave them ten minas
LUK.19.14	But his citizens hated him, and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to be king over us!’ 
LUK.19.15	And it happened that when he returned after
LUK.19.16	So the first arrived, saying, ‘Sir, your mina has made ten minas more!’ 
LUK.19.17	And he said to him, ‘Well done, good slave! Because you have been faithful in a very small thing, have authority
LUK.19.18	And the second came, saying, ‘Sir, your mina has made five minas.’ 
LUK.19.19	So he said to this one also, ‘And you be over five cities.’ 
LUK.19.20	And another came, saying, ‘Sir, behold your mina, which I had put away for safekeeping in a piece of cloth. 
LUK.19.21	For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man—you withdraw what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow!’ 
LUK.19.22	He said to him, ‘By your own words
LUK.19.23	And why did you not give my money to the bank, and I, when I
LUK.19.24	And to the bystanders he said, ‘Take away from him the mina and give it
LUK.19.25	And they said to him, ‘Sir, he has ten minas.’ 
LUK.19.26	‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given. But from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. 
LUK.19.27	But these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them
LUK.19.28	And after he
LUK.19.29	And it happened that when he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the hill
LUK.19.30	saying, ‘Go into the village in front of you, in which as you
LUK.19.31	And if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’
LUK.19.32	So those who were sent went and
LUK.19.33	And as
LUK.19.34	So they said, ‘The Lord has need of it.’ 
LUK.19.35	And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they put Jesus on it. 
LUK.19.36	And as
LUK.19.37	Now as
LUK.19.38	saying, 
LUK.19.38	“Blessed is the king, 
LUK.19.38	the one who comes in the name of the Lord!
LUK.19.38	Peace in heaven 
LUK.19.38	and glory in the highest!” 
LUK.19.39	And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!” 
LUK.19.40	And he answered and
LUK.19.41	And when he approached and
LUK.19.42	saying, “If you had known on this day—even you—the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. 
LUK.19.43	For days will come upon you and your enemies will put up an embankment
LUK.19.44	And they will raze you to the ground, you and your children within you, and will not leave a stone upon a stone within you, because
LUK.19.45	And he entered into the temple courts
LUK.19.46	saying to them, “It is written, ‘And my house will be a house of prayer,’
LUK.19.47	And he was teaching every day in the temple courts,
LUK.19.48	And they did not find anything they could do, because all the people were paying close attention to what they were hearing from him. 
LUK.20.1	 And it happened that on one of the days while
LUK.20.2	and said, saying to him, “Tell us, by what authority you are doing these things, or who is the one who gave you this authority? 
LUK.20.3	And he answered and
LUK.20.4	The baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men? 
LUK.20.5	And they discussed this
LUK.20.6	But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us to death, because they are convinced that John was a prophet.” 
LUK.20.7	And they replied that they did not know where it was from. 
LUK.20.8	And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.” 
LUK.20.9	And he began to tell the people this parable: “A man
LUK.20.10	And at the proper time he sent a slave to the tenant farmers, so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenant farmers sent him away empty-handed after
LUK.20.11	And he proceeded to send another slave, but they beat and dishonored that one also, and
LUK.20.12	And he proceeded to send a third, but they wounded and
LUK.20.13	So the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’ 
LUK.20.14	But when
LUK.20.15	And they threw him out of the vineyard and
LUK.20.16	He will come and destroy those tenant farmers and give the vineyard to others.” And when they
LUK.20.17	But he looked intently at them and
LUK.20.17	‘The stone which the builders rejected, 
LUK.20.17	this has become the cornerstone.’
LUK.20.18	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls—it will crush him!” 
LUK.20.19	And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay their
LUK.20.20	And they watched him
LUK.20.21	And they asked him, saying, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and do not show partiality,
LUK.20.22	Is it permitted for us to pay taxes
LUK.20.23	But seeing through their craftiness, he said to them, 
LUK.20.24	“Show me a denarius! Whose image and inscription does it have?” And they answered and
LUK.20.25	So he said to them, “Well then, give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!” 
LUK.20.26	And they were not able to catch him
LUK.20.27	Now some of the Sadducees—who deny that there is a resurrection
LUK.20.28	saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us if someone’s brother dies having a wife, and this man is childless, that his brother should take the wife and father
LUK.20.29	Now there were seven brothers, and the first took a wife and
LUK.20.30	and the second, 
LUK.20.31	and the third took her, and likewise also the seven did not leave children and died. 
LUK.20.32	Finally the woman also died. 
LUK.20.33	Therefore in the resurrection, the woman—whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.” 
LUK.20.34	And Jesus said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, 
LUK.20.35	but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage, 
LUK.20.36	for they are not even able to die any longer, because they are like the angels and are sons of God, because they
LUK.20.37	But that the dead are raised, even Moses revealed in the passage about
LUK.20.38	Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him!” 
LUK.20.39	And some of the scribes answered and
LUK.20.40	For they no longer dared to ask him anything. 
LUK.20.41	But he said to them, “In what sense do they say that the Christ is David’s son? 
LUK.20.42	For David himself says in the book of Psalms, 
LUK.20.42	‘The Lord said to my Lord, 
LUK.20.42	“Sit at my right hand, 
LUK.20.43	until I make your enemies 
LUK.20.43	a footstool for your feet.” ’
LUK.20.44	David therefore calls him ‘Lord,’ and how is he his son?” 
LUK.20.45	And while
LUK.20.46	“Beware of the scribes, who like walking around in long robes and who love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets, 
LUK.20.47	who devour the houses of widows and pray lengthy prayers for the sake of appearance. These will receive more severe condemnation!” 
LUK.21.1	 And he looked up and
LUK.21.2	and he saw a certain poor widow putting in there two small copper coins.
LUK.21.3	And he said, “Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all of them. 
LUK.21.4	For these all put gifts
LUK.21.5	And while
LUK.21.6	“As for these things that you see—days will come in which not one stone will be left on another stone that will not be thrown down!” 
LUK.21.7	And they asked him, saying, “Teacher, when therefore will these things happen, and what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?” 
LUK.21.8	And he said, Watch out that you are not deceived! For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and ‘The time is near!’ Do not go after them! 
LUK.21.9	And when you hear about wars and insurrections, do not be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end will not be at once.” 
LUK.21.10	Then he said to them, “nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom. 
LUK.21.11	There will be great earthquakes and famines and plagues in various places. There will be terrible sights and great signs from heaven. 
LUK.21.12	“But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you,
LUK.21.13	This will turn out to you for a time of witness. 
LUK.21.14	Therefore make up your minds
LUK.21.15	for I will give you a mouth and wisdom that all your opponents will not be able to resist or contradict. 
LUK.21.16	And you will be handed over even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put to death some of you. 
LUK.21.17	And you will be hated by all because of my name. 
LUK.21.18	Even a hair of your head will never perish! 
LUK.21.19	By your patient endurance you will gain your lives. 
LUK.21.20	“But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. 
LUK.21.21	Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those inside it
LUK.21.22	because these are days of vengeance, so that all the things that are written can be fulfilled. 
LUK.21.23	Woe to those who are pregnant
LUK.21.24	and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations,
LUK.21.25	“And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity from the noise of the sea and its surging, 
LUK.21.26	people fainting from fear and expectation of what is coming on the inhabited earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
LUK.21.27	And then they will see the Son of Man arriving in a cloud
LUK.21.28	But when
LUK.21.29	And he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees. 
LUK.21.30	When they put out foliage,
LUK.21.31	So also you, when you see these things happening, know
LUK.21.32	Truly I say to you that this generation will never pass away until all things take place! 
LUK.21.33	Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. 
LUK.21.34	“But take care for yourselves, lest your hearts are weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of daily life, and that day come upon you suddenly 
LUK.21.35	like a trap. For it will come upon all who reside on the face of the whole earth. 
LUK.21.36	But be alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.” 
LUK.21.37	So throughout the days he was teaching in the temple courts,
LUK.21.38	And all the people were getting up very early in the morning to come
LUK.22.1	 Now the feast of Unleavened Bread (which is called Passover) was drawing near. 
LUK.22.2	And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they could destroy him, because they were afraid of the people. 
LUK.22.3	And Satan entered into Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve. 
LUK.22.4	And he went away and
LUK.22.5	And they were delighted, and came to an agreement with him to give him
LUK.22.6	And he agreed, and began looking
LUK.22.7	And the day of the feast of Unleavened Bread came, on which it was necessary for the Passover lamb to be sacrificed. 
LUK.22.8	And he sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and
LUK.22.9	So they said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare it?”
LUK.22.10	And he said to them, “Behold, when
LUK.22.11	And you will say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’ 
LUK.22.12	And he will show you a large furnished
LUK.22.13	So they went and
LUK.22.14	And when the hour came, he reclined at the table, and the apostles with him. 
LUK.22.15	And he said to them, “I have earnestly desired
LUK.22.16	For I tell you that I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” 
LUK.22.17	And he took in hand a cup, and
LUK.22.18	For I tell you,
LUK.22.19	And he took bread, and
LUK.22.20	And in the same way the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood which is poured out for you. 
LUK.22.21	“But behold, the hand of the one who is betraying me is with me on the table! 
LUK.22.22	For the Son of Man is going according to what has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!” 
LUK.22.23	And they began to debate with one another who then of them it could be who was going to do this. 
LUK.22.24	And a dispute also occurred among them as to which of them was recognized as being greatest. 
LUK.22.25	So he said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles
LUK.22.26	But you are not to be like this! But the one who is greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves. 
LUK.22.27	For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am in your midst as the one who serves. 
LUK.22.28	“And you are the ones who have remained
LUK.22.29	and I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred on me, 
LUK.22.30	that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
LUK.22.31	“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to sift you like wheat, 
LUK.22.32	but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. And you, when
LUK.22.33	But he said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!” 
LUK.22.34	And he said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know me!” 
LUK.22.35	And he said to them, “When I sent you out without a money bag and a traveler’s bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?”
LUK.22.36	And he said to them, “But now the one who has a money bag must take it,
LUK.22.37	For I tell you that this that is written must be fulfilled in me: ‘And he was counted with the criminals.’
LUK.22.38	So they said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords!” And he said to them, “It is adequate.” 
LUK.22.39	And he went away and
LUK.22.40	And when
LUK.22.41	And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw and knelt down
LUK.22.42	saying, “Father, if you are willing, take away this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will but yours be done.” 〚
LUK.22.43	And an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. 
LUK.22.44	And being in anguish, he began praying
LUK.22.45	And when he
LUK.22.46	and he said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up and
LUK.22.47	While
LUK.22.48	But Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?” 
LUK.22.49	And when
LUK.22.50	And a certain one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. 
LUK.22.51	But Jesus answered and
LUK.22.52	And Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come out against him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber? 
LUK.22.53	Every day when
LUK.22.54	And they arrested him and
LUK.22.55	And when they
LUK.22.56	And a certain female slave, seeing him sitting in the light and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him!” 
LUK.22.57	But he denied it,
LUK.22.58	And after a short time another person saw him and
LUK.22.59	And after
LUK.22.60	But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about!” And immediately, while
LUK.22.61	And the Lord turned around and
LUK.22.62	And he went outside and
LUK.22.63	And the men who were guarding him began to mock
LUK.22.64	and after
LUK.22.65	And they were saying many other things against him, reviling him.
LUK.22.66	And when day came, the council of elders of the people gathered, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away to their Sanhedrin,
LUK.22.67	saying, “If you are the Christ, tell us!” But he said to them, “If I tell you, you will never believe, 
LUK.22.68	and if I ask you,
LUK.22.69	But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.” 
LUK.22.70	So they all said, “Are you then the Son of God?” And he said to them, “You say that I am.” 
LUK.22.71	And they said, “Why do we have need of further testimony? For we ourselves have heard it
LUK.23.1	 And the whole assembly of them rose up and
LUK.23.2	And they began to accuse him, saying, “We have found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us
LUK.23.3	And Pilate asked him, saying, “Are you the king of the Jews?” And he answered him and
LUK.23.4	So Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for an accusation against this man.” 
LUK.23.5	But they insisted, saying, “He incites the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea and beginning from Galilee as far as here.” 
LUK.23.6	Now when
LUK.23.7	And when he
LUK.23.8	And when
LUK.23.9	So he questioned him at considerable length,
LUK.23.10	And the chief priests and the scribes were standing there vehemently accusing him. 
LUK.23.11	And Herod with his soldiers also treated him with contempt, and after
LUK.23.12	And both Herod and Pilate became friends with one another on that same day, for they had previously been enemies of one another.
LUK.23.13	So Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people 
LUK.23.14	and
LUK.23.15	But neither did Herod, because he sent him back to us. And behold, nothing deserving death has been done
LUK.23.16	Therefore I will punish him and
LUK.23.18	But they all cried out in unison, saying, “Take this man away, and release for us Barabbas!” 
LUK.23.19	(who had been thrown in prison because of a certain insurrection that had taken place in the city, and for murder). 
LUK.23.20	And Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them
LUK.23.21	but they kept crying out, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!” 
LUK.23.22	So he said to them a third time, “Why? What wrong has this man done? I found no basis for an accusation deserving death
LUK.23.23	But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he be crucified. And their cries prevailed. 
LUK.23.24	And Pilate decided that their demand should be granted. 
LUK.23.25	And he released the one who had been thrown into prison because of insurrection and murder, whom they were asking for, but Jesus he handed over to their will. 
LUK.23.26	And as they led him away, they seized Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and
LUK.23.27	And a great crowd of the people were following him, and of women who were mourning and lamenting him. 
LUK.23.28	But turning to them, Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children! 
LUK.23.29	For behold, days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that did not give birth, and the breasts that did not nurse!’ 
LUK.23.30	Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’ 
LUK.23.31	For if they do these things when the wood is green,
LUK.23.32	And two other criminals were also led away to be executed with him. 
LUK.23.33	And when they came to the place that is called “The Skull,” there they crucified him, and the criminals, the one on his right and the other on his left. 
LUK.23.34	〚But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”〛
LUK.23.35	And the people stood there watching, but the rulers also ridiculed him,
LUK.23.36	And the soldiers also mocked him, coming up and
LUK.23.37	and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!” 
LUK.23.38	And there was also an inscription over him, “This is the king of the Jews.” 
LUK.23.39	And one of the criminals who were hanged there reviled him, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself—and us!” 
LUK.23.40	But the other answered and
LUK.23.41	And we indeed justly, for we are receiving what we deserve
LUK.23.42	And he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom!” 
LUK.23.43	And he said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.” 
LUK.23.44	And by this time it was about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour 
LUK.23.45	because
LUK.23.46	And Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit!”
LUK.23.47	Now when
LUK.23.48	And all the crowds that had come together for this spectacle, when they
LUK.23.49	And all his acquaintances, and the women who had followed him from Galilee who saw these things, stood at a distance. 
LUK.23.50	And behold, a man named
LUK.23.51	(this man was not consenting to their plan and deed), from Arimathea, a Judean town,
LUK.23.52	This man approached Pilate and
LUK.23.53	And he took it
LUK.23.54	And it was the day of preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near. 
LUK.23.55	And the women who had been accompanying him from Galilee followed and
LUK.23.56	And they returned and
LUK.24.1	 Now on the first day of the week, at very early dawn, they came back to the tomb bringing the fragrant spices which they had prepared. 
LUK.24.2	And they found the stone had been rolled away from the tomb, 
LUK.24.3	but when they
LUK.24.4	And it happened that while they were perplexed about this, behold, two men in gleaming clothing stood near them. 
LUK.24.5	And as
LUK.24.6	He is not here, but has been raised! Remember how he spoke to you while he
LUK.24.7	saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of men who are sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise?” 
LUK.24.8	And they remembered his words, 
LUK.24.9	and when they
LUK.24.10	Now Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the others with them were telling these things to the apostles. 
LUK.24.11	And these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they refused to believe them. 
LUK.24.12	But Peter got up and
LUK.24.13	And behold, on that same day, two of them were traveling to a village named
LUK.24.14	and they were conversing with one another about all these things that had happened. 
LUK.24.15	And it happened that while they were conversing, and discussing, Jesus himself also approached and
LUK.24.16	but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him. 
LUK.24.17	And he said to them, “What are these matters that you are discussing with one another as you
LUK.24.18	And one of them, named
LUK.24.19	And he said to them, “What things?” So they said to him, “The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, a man who was a prophet, powerful in deed and word before God and all the people, 
LUK.24.20	and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to a sentence of death, and crucified him. 
LUK.24.21	But we were hoping that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. But in addition to all these things, this is the third day since
LUK.24.22	But also some women from among us astonished us, who were at the tomb early in the morning, 
LUK.24.23	and when they
LUK.24.24	And some of those with us went out to the tomb and found it
LUK.24.25	And he said to them, “O foolish and slow in heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! 
LUK.24.26	Was it not necessary that the Christ suffer these things and enter into his glory?” 
LUK.24.27	And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures. 
LUK.24.28	And they drew near to the village where they were going, and he acted as though he was going farther. 
LUK.24.29	And they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, because it is getting toward evening, and by this time the day is far spent.” And he went in to stay with them. 
LUK.24.30	And it happened that when he reclined at the table with them, he took the bread and
LUK.24.31	And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he became invisible to them. 
LUK.24.32	And they said to one another, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he was speaking with us on the road, while he was explaining the scriptures to us?” 
LUK.24.33	And they got up that same hour and
LUK.24.34	saying, “The Lord has really been raised, and has appeared to Simon!” 
LUK.24.35	And they began describing
LUK.24.36	And while
LUK.24.37	But they were startled and became terrified, and
LUK.24.38	And he said to them, “Why are you frightened? And for what reason do doubts arise in your hearts? 
LUK.24.39	Look at my hands and my feet, that I am I myself! Touch me and see, because a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.”
LUK.24.40	And when he
LUK.24.41	And while
LUK.24.42	So they gave him a piece of broiled fish, 
LUK.24.43	and he took it
LUK.24.44	And he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I
LUK.24.45	Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, 
LUK.24.46	and said to them, “Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and would rise from the dead on the third day, 
LUK.24.47	and repentance and the forgiveness
LUK.24.48	You are witnesses of these things. 
LUK.24.49	And behold, I am sending out
LUK.24.50	And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them. 
LUK.24.51	And it happened that while he was blessing them, he parted from them and was taken up into heaven. 
LUK.24.52	And they worshiped him and
LUK.24.53	And they were continually
JHN.1.1	 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
JHN.1.2	This one was in the beginning with God. 
JHN.1.3	All things came into being through him, and apart from him not one thing came into being that
JHN.1.4	In him was life, and the life was the light of humanity.
JHN.1.5	And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome
JHN.1.6	A man came, sent from God, whose name was
JHN.1.7	This one came for a witness, in order that he could testify about the light, so that all would believe through him. 
JHN.1.8	That one was not the light, but came
JHN.1.9	The true light, who gives light to every person, was coming into the world. 
JHN.1.10	He was in the world, and the world came into being through him, and the world did not recognize
JHN.1.11	He came to his own things, and his own people did not receive him. 
JHN.1.12	But as many as received him—to those who believe in his name—he gave to them authority to become children of God, 
JHN.1.13	who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of a husband, but of God. 
JHN.1.14	And the Word became flesh and took up residence among us, and we saw his glory, glory as of the one and only from the Father, full of grace and truth. 
JHN.1.15	John testified about him and cried out, saying, “This one was he about whom I said, ‘The one who comes after me is ahead of me, because he existed before me.’ ” 
JHN.1.16	For from his fullness we have all received, and grace after grace. 
JHN.1.17	For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ. 
JHN.1.18	No one has seen God at any time; the one and only, God, the one who is in the bosom of the Father—that one has made him
JHN.1.19	And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent
JHN.1.20	And he confessed—and he did not deny, and confessed—“I am not the Christ!” 
JHN.1.21	And they asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I am not!” “Are you the Prophet?”
JHN.1.22	Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we can give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?” 
JHN.1.23	He said, 
JHN.1.23	“I am ‘the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, 
JHN.1.23	“Make straight the way of the Lord,” ’
JHN.1.23	just as Isaiah the prophet said.” 
JHN.1.24	(And they had been sent from the Pharisees.) 
JHN.1.25	And they asked him and said to him, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” 
JHN.1.26	John answered them, saying, “I baptize with water. In your midst stands one whom you do not know—
JHN.1.27	the one who comes after me, of whom I am not worthy to untie
JHN.1.28	These things took place in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. 
JHN.1.29	On the next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! 
JHN.1.30	This one is the one about whom I said, ‘After me is coming a man who is ahead of me, because he existed before me.’ 
JHN.1.31	And I did not know him, but in order that he could be revealed to Israel, because of this I came baptizing with water.” 
JHN.1.32	And John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and remaining upon him. 
JHN.1.33	And I did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water, that one said to me, ‘The one upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him—this one is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ 
JHN.1.34	And I have seen and testify that this one is the Chosen One
JHN.1.35	On the next day again John was standing there,
JHN.1.36	and looking at Jesus as he
JHN.1.37	And the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus. 
JHN.1.38	And Jesus, turning around and seeing them following him,
JHN.1.39	He said to them, “Come and you will see!” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day (it was about the tenth hour). 
JHN.1.40	Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard John and followed him. 
JHN.1.41	This one first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is translated “Christ”). 
JHN.1.42	He brought him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, “You are Simon the son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is interpreted “Peter”). 
JHN.1.43	On the next day he wanted to depart for Galilee, and he found Philip. And Jesus said to him, “Follow me!” 
JHN.1.44	(Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.) 
JHN.1.45	Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets wrote about—Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth!” 
JHN.1.46	And Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see!” 
JHN.1.47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him, “Look! A true Israelite
JHN.1.48	Nathanael said to him, “From where do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you
JHN.1.49	Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the king of Israel!” 
JHN.1.50	Jesus answered and said to him, “Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these!” 
JHN.1.51	And he said to him, “Truly, truly I say to all of you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.” 
JHN.2.1	 And on the third day, there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. 
JHN.2.2	And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding. 
JHN.2.3	And when the
JHN.2.4	And Jesus said to her, “What does your concern have to do with me,
JHN.2.5	His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it!”
JHN.2.6	Now six stone water jars were set there, in accordance with the ceremonial cleansing of the Jews, each holding two or three measures.
JHN.2.7	Jesus said to them, “Fill the water jars with water.” And they filled them to the brim. 
JHN.2.8	And he said to them, “Now draw some
JHN.2.9	Now when the head steward tasted the water which had become wine and did not know where it was from—but the servants who had drawn the water knew—the head steward summoned the bridegroom 
JHN.2.10	and said to him, “Everyone
JHN.2.11	This beginning of signs Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, and revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him. 
JHN.2.12	After this he went down to Capernaum, and his mother and brothers
JHN.2.13	And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
JHN.2.14	And he found in the temple courts
JHN.2.15	And he made a whip of cords and
JHN.2.16	And to the ones selling the doves he said, “Take these things away from here! Do not make my Father’s house a marketplace!”
JHN.2.17	His disciples remembered that it is written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”
JHN.2.18	So the Jews answered and said to him, “What sign do you show to us, because you are doing these things?” 
JHN.2.19	Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up!” 
JHN.2.20	Then the Jews said, “This temple has been under construction
JHN.2.21	But he was speaking about the temple of his body. 
JHN.2.22	So when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture and the saying that Jesus had spoken. 
JHN.2.23	Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name because they
JHN.2.24	But Jesus himself did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people,
JHN.2.25	and because he did not need
JHN.3.1	 Now there was a man of the Pharisees whose name was
JHN.3.2	This man came to him at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are
JHN.3.3	Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone is born from above,
JHN.3.4	Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is an old man? He is not able to enter into his mother’s womb for the second time and be born, can he?”
JHN.3.5	Jesus answered, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone is born of water and spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God. 
JHN.3.6	What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. 
JHN.3.7	Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘It is necessary for you to be born from above.’
JHN.3.8	The wind blows wherever it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.” 
JHN.3.9	Nicodemus answered and said to him, “How can these things be?” 
JHN.3.10	Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and you do not understand these things? 
JHN.3.11	Truly, truly I say to you, we speak what we know, and we testify about what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony! 
JHN.3.12	If I tell you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? 
JHN.3.13	And no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven—the Son of Man. 
JHN.3.14	And just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness,
JHN.3.15	so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life.”
JHN.3.16	For in this way God loved the world, so that he gave his one and only Son, in order that everyone who believes in him will not perish, but will have eternal life. 
JHN.3.17	For God did not send his Son into the world in order that he should judge
JHN.3.18	The one who believes in him is not judged,
JHN.3.19	And this is the judgment: that the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil. 
JHN.3.20	For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds be exposed. 
JHN.3.21	But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, in order that his deeds may be revealed, that they are done in God. 
JHN.3.22	After these things Jesus and his disciples came into Judean territory, and there he spent time with them and was baptizing. 
JHN.3.23	Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and they were coming and were being baptized. 
JHN.3.24	(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.) 
JHN.3.25	So a dispute occurred on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew
JHN.3.26	And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, about whom you testified—look, this one is baptizing, and all are coming to him!” 
JHN.3.27	John answered and said, “A man can receive not one thing unless it is granted to him from heaven! 
JHN.3.28	You yourselves testify about me that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I am sent before that one.’ 
JHN.3.29	The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly
JHN.3.30	It is necessary for that one to increase, but for me to decrease.” 
JHN.3.31	The one who comes from above is over all. The one who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks from the earth; the one who comes from heaven is over all. 
JHN.3.32	What he has seen and heard, this he testifies, and no one accepts his testimony. 
JHN.3.33	The one who accepts his testimony has attested that God is true. 
JHN.3.34	For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God, for he does not give the Spirit by measure. 
JHN.3.35	The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. 
JHN.3.36	The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life—but the wrath of God remains on him.
JHN.4.1	 Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John 
JHN.4.2	(although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples), 
JHN.4.3	he left Judea and departed again for Galilee. 
JHN.4.4	And it was necessary for him to go through Samaria. 
JHN.4.5	Now he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. 
JHN.4.6	And Jacob’s well was there, so Jesus, because he had become tired from the journey, simply sat down at the well. It was about the sixth hour. 
JHN.4.7	A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me water
JHN.4.8	(For his disciples had gone away into the town so that they could buy food.) 
JHN.4.9	So the Samaritan woman said to him, “How do you, being a Jew, ask from me water
JHN.4.10	Jesus answered and said to her, “If you had known the gift of God and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me water
JHN.4.11	The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket and the well is deep! From where then do you get this living water? 
JHN.4.12	You are not greater than our father Jacob, are you,
JHN.4.13	Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again. 
JHN.4.14	But whoever drinks of this water which I will give to him will never be thirsty for eternity, but the water which I will give to him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.” 
JHN.4.15	The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or come here to draw water!”
JHN.4.16	He said to her, “Go, call your husband and come here.” 
JHN.4.17	The woman answered and said to him, “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her, “You have said rightly, ‘I do not have a husband,’ 
JHN.4.18	for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you have now is not your husband; this you have said truthfully!” 
JHN.4.19	The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet. 
JHN.4.20	Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you people
JHN.4.21	Jesus said to her, “Believe me, woman, that an hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. 
JHN.4.22	You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews. 
JHN.4.23	But an hour is coming—and now is here
JHN.4.24	God is spirit, and the ones who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” 
JHN.4.25	The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (the one called Christ); “whenever that one comes, he will proclaim all things to us.” 
JHN.4.26	Jesus said to her, “I, the one speaking to you, am he.
JHN.4.27	And at this point
JHN.4.28	So the woman left her water jar and went away into the town and said to the people,
JHN.4.29	“Come, see a man who told me everything I have ever done! Perhaps this one is the Christ?” 
JHN.4.30	They went out from the town and were coming to him. 
JHN.4.31	In the meanwhile the disciples were asking him, saying, “Rabbi, eat something!”
JHN.4.32	But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.” 
JHN.4.33	So the disciples began to say
JHN.4.34	Jesus said to them, “My food is that I do the will of the one who sent me and complete his work. 
JHN.4.35	Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months and the harvest comes’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.
JHN.4.36	The one who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life, in order that the one who sows and the one who reaps can rejoice together. 
JHN.4.37	For in this instance
JHN.4.38	I sent you to reap what you did not work for; others have worked, and you have entered into their work.” 
JHN.4.39	Now from that town many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me everything that I have done.” 
JHN.4.40	So when the Samaritans came to him, they began asking
JHN.4.41	And many more believed because of his word, 
JHN.4.42	And they were saying to the woman, “No longer because of what you said
JHN.4.43	And after the two days he departed from there into Galilee. 
JHN.4.44	For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own homeland. 
JHN.4.45	So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, because they
JHN.4.46	Now he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was at Capernaum a certain royal official whose son was sick. 
JHN.4.47	This man, when he
JHN.4.48	So Jesus said to him, “Unless you people
JHN.4.49	The royal official said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies!” 
JHN.4.50	Jesus said to him, “Go, your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he departed. 
JHN.4.51	Now as
JHN.4.52	So he inquired from them the hour at which he had gotten better. Then they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.” 
JHN.4.53	So the father knew that it was that
JHN.4.54	Now this is again a second sign Jesus performed when he
JHN.5.1	 After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
JHN.5.2	Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool called in Aramaic 
JHN.5.3	In these were lying a large number of those who were sick, blind, lame, paralyzed.
JHN.5.5	And a certain man was there who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness. 
JHN.5.6	Jesus, when he
JHN.5.7	The one who was sick answered him, “Sir, I do not have anyone that, whenever the water is stirred up, could put me into the pool. But while
JHN.5.8	Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk!” 
JHN.5.9	And immediately the man became well and picked up his mat and began to walk.
JHN.5.10	So the Jews were saying to the one who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not permitted for you to pick up the mat!”
JHN.5.11	But he answered them, “The one who made me well—that one said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk!’ ” 
JHN.5.12	So they asked him,
JHN.5.13	But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn while
JHN.5.14	After these things Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “Look, you have become well! Sin no longer, lest something worse happen to you.” 
JHN.5.15	The man went and reported to the Jews that Jesus was the one who made him well. 
JHN.5.16	And on account of this the Jews began to persecute
JHN.5.17	But he answered
JHN.5.18	So on account of this the Jews were seeking even more to kill him, because he not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God his own Father, thus
JHN.5.19	So Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, the Son can do nothing from himself except what he sees the Father doing. For whatever that one does, these things also the Son does likewise. 
JHN.5.20	For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he himself is doing. And greater works than these he will show him, so that you will be astonished. 
JHN.5.21	For just as the Father raises the dead and makes them
JHN.5.22	For the Father does not judge anyone, but he has given all judgment to the Son, 
JHN.5.23	in order that all people
JHN.5.24	Truly, truly I say to you that the one who hears my word and who believes the one who sent me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life. 
JHN.5.25	“Truly, truly I say to you, that an hour is coming—and now is here—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and the ones who hear will live. 
JHN.5.26	For just as the Father has life in himself, thus also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself. 
JHN.5.27	And he has granted him authority to carry out judgment, because he is the Son of Man. 
JHN.5.28	“Do not be astonished at this, because an hour is coming in which all those in the tombs will hear his voice 
JHN.5.29	and they will come out—those who have done good things to a resurrection of life, but those who have practiced evil things to a resurrection of judgment. 
JHN.5.30	I am able to do nothing from myself. Just as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the one who sent me. 
JHN.5.31	“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. 
JHN.5.32	There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true. 
JHN.5.33	You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. 
JHN.5.34	(And I do not receive testimony from people, but I say these things in order that you may be saved.) 
JHN.5.35	That one was the lamp which was burning and shining, and you wanted to rejoice for an hour in his light. 
JHN.5.36	“But I have a testimony greater than John’s, for the works which the Father has given to me that I should complete them—the very works which I am doing—these testify about me, that the Father has sent me. 
JHN.5.37	And the Father who sent me, that one has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form. 
JHN.5.38	And you do not have his word residing in yourselves, because the one whom that one sent, in this one you do not believe. 
JHN.5.39	You search
JHN.5.40	And you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life. 
JHN.5.41	“I do not accept glory
JHN.5.42	but I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves. 
JHN.5.43	I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me. If another should come in his own name, you would accept that one! 
JHN.5.44	How are you able to believe, if you
JHN.5.45	Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father! The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope! 
JHN.5.46	For if you had believed Moses, you would believe me, for that one wrote about me. 
JHN.5.47	But if you do not believe that one’s writings, how will you believe my words?” 
JHN.6.1	 After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee (that is, Tiberias). 
JHN.6.2	And a large crowd was following him because they were observing the signs that he was doing on those who were sick. 
JHN.6.3	So Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down there with his disciples. 
JHN.6.4	(Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.) 
JHN.6.5	Then Jesus, when he looked up
JHN.6.6	(Now he said this to test him, because he knew what he was going to do.) 
JHN.6.7	Philip replied to him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be enough for them, in order that each one could receive a little.” 
JHN.6.8	One of his disciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, said to him, 
JHN.6.9	“Here is a boy who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so many people?” 
JHN.6.10	Jesus said, “Make the people recline.” (Now there was a lot of grass in the place.) So the men reclined, approximately five thousand in number. 
JHN.6.11	Then Jesus took the bread, and after he
JHN.6.12	And when they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, “Gather the remaining fragments so that nothing is lost.” 
JHN.6.13	So they gathered them,
JHN.6.14	Now when
JHN.6.15	Then Jesus, because he
JHN.6.16	Now when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea. 
JHN.6.17	And getting into a boat, they began to go
JHN.6.18	And the sea began to be stirred up
JHN.6.19	Then when they
JHN.6.20	But he said to them, “It is I! Do not be afraid!” 
JHN.6.21	So they were wanting to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat came to the land to which they were going. 
JHN.6.22	On the next day, the crowd that was on the other side of the sea saw that other boats were not there (except one), and that Jesus had not entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had departed alone. 
JHN.6.23	Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after
JHN.6.24	So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus. 
JHN.6.25	And when they
JHN.6.26	Jesus replied to them and said, “Truly, truly I say to you, you seek me not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied! 
JHN.6.27	Do not work for the food that perishes, but the food that remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has set his seal on this one.” 
JHN.6.28	So they said to him, “What shall we do that we can accomplish the works of God?” 
JHN.6.29	Jesus answered and said to them, “This is the work of God: that you believe in the one whom that one sent.” 
JHN.6.30	So they said to him, “Then what sign will you perform, so that we can see it
JHN.6.31	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’
JHN.6.32	Then Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, Moses did not give you bread from heaven, but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven! 
JHN.6.33	For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” 
JHN.6.34	So they said to him, “Sir, always give us this bread!” 
JHN.6.35	Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never be hungry, and the one who believes in me will never be thirsty again. 
JHN.6.36	But I said to you that you have seen me and do not believe. 
JHN.6.37	Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never throw out, 
JHN.6.38	because I have come down from heaven not that I should do my will, but the will of the one who sent me. 
JHN.6.39	Now this is the will of the one who sent me: that everyone whom he has given me, I would not lose any of them,
JHN.6.40	For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks at the Son and believes in him would have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.” 
JHN.6.41	Now the Jews began to grumble
JHN.6.42	and they were saying, “Is this one not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” 
JHN.6.43	Jesus answered and said to them, “Do not grumble among yourselves!
JHN.6.44	No one is able to come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up on the last day. 
JHN.6.45	It is written in the prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’
JHN.6.46	(Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God—this one has seen the Father.)
JHN.6.47	Truly, truly I say to you, the one who believes has eternal life. 
JHN.6.48	I am the bread of life. 
JHN.6.49	Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died. 
JHN.6.50	This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that someone may eat from it and not die. 
JHN.6.51	I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever.
JHN.6.52	So the Jews began to quarrel
JHN.6.53	Then Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves! 
JHN.6.54	The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. 
JHN.6.55	For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 
JHN.6.56	The one who eats
JHN.6.57	Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so also the one who eats
JHN.6.58	This is the bread that came down from heaven, not as the fathers ate and died. The one who eats
JHN.6.59	He said these things while
JHN.6.60	Thus many of his disciples, when they
JHN.6.61	But Jesus, because he
JHN.6.62	Then what if you see the Son of Man ascending where he was before? 
JHN.6.63	The Spirit is the one who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. 
JHN.6.64	But there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.) 
JHN.6.65	And he said, “Because of this I said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by the Father.” 
JHN.6.66	For this reason many of his disciples drew back
JHN.6.67	So Jesus said to the twelve, “You do not want to go away also, do you?”
JHN.6.68	Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life. 
JHN.6.69	And we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.” 
JHN.6.70	Jesus replied to them, “Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is the devil?” 
JHN.6.71	(Now he was speaking about Judas son of Simon Iscariot, because this one—one of the twelve—was going to betray him.) 
JHN.7.1	 And after these things Jesus was going about in Galilee. For he did not want to go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him. 
JHN.7.2	Now the feast of the Jews—the feast of Tabernacles—was near. 
JHN.7.3	So his brothers said to him, “Depart from here and go to Judea, so that your disciples also can see your works that you are doing. 
JHN.7.4	For no one does anything in secret and yet he himself desires to be publicly recognized.
JHN.7.5	(For not even his brothers believed in him.) 
JHN.7.6	So Jesus said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. 
JHN.7.7	The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I am testifying about it, that its deeds are evil. 
JHN.7.8	You go up to the feast. I am not
JHN.7.9	And when he
JHN.7.10	But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but (as it were) in secret. 
JHN.7.11	So the Jews were looking for him at the feast, and were saying, “Where is he?” 
JHN.7.12	And there was a lot of grumbling concerning him among the crowds; some were saying, “He is a good man,” but others were saying, “No, but he deceives the crowd.” 
JHN.7.13	However, no one was speaking openly about him for fear of the Jews. 
JHN.7.14	Now when the feast was already half over,
JHN.7.15	Then the Jews were astonished, saying, “How does this man possess knowledge,
JHN.7.16	So Jesus answered them and said, “My teaching is not mine, but is from the one who sent me. 
JHN.7.17	If anyone wants to do his will, he will know about my
JHN.7.18	The one who speaks from himself seeks his own glory. But the one who seeks the glory of the one who sent him—this one is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him. 
JHN.7.19	Has not Moses given you the law, and none of you carries out the law? Why do you seek to kill me?” 
JHN.7.20	The crowd replied, “You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?” 
JHN.7.21	Jesus answered and said to them, “I performed one work, and you are all astonished. 
JHN.7.22	Because of this Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath. 
JHN.7.23	If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses would not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a whole man well
JHN.7.24	Do not judge according to outward appearance, but judge according to righteous judgment!” 
JHN.7.25	Then some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem began to say,
JHN.7.26	And behold, he is speaking openly and they are saying nothing to him! Can it be that the rulers truly know that this man is the Christ? 
JHN.7.27	Yet we know where this man is from, but the Christ, whenever he comes—no one knows where he is from!” 
JHN.7.28	Then Jesus cried out in the temple courts,
JHN.7.29	I know him, because I am from him and he sent me.” 
JHN.7.30	So they were seeking to seize him, and no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. 
JHN.7.31	But from the crowd many believed in him and were saying, “Whenever the Christ comes, he will not perform more signs than this man has done, will he?”
JHN.7.32	The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers in order to take him into custody .
JHN.7.33	Then Jesus said, “Yet a little time I am with you, and I am going to the one who sent me. 
JHN.7.34	You will seek me and will not find me,
JHN.7.35	So the Jews said to one another, “Where is this one going to go, that we will not find him? He is not going to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, is he?
JHN.7.36	What is this saying that he said, ‘You will seek me and will not find me,
JHN.7.37	Now on the last day of the feast—the great day—Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me, and let him drink, 
JHN.7.38	the one who believes in me.
JHN.7.39	Now he said this concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were about to receive. For the Spirit was not yet given,
JHN.7.40	Then, when they
JHN.7.41	Others were saying, “This man is the Christ!” But others were saying, “No, for the Christ does not come from Galilee, does he?
JHN.7.42	Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?” 
JHN.7.43	So there was a division in the crowd because of him. 
JHN.7.44	And some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid hands on him. 
JHN.7.45	So the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, “Why
JHN.7.46	The officers replied, “Never has a man spoken like this!” 
JHN.7.47	Then the Pharisees replied to them, “You have not also been deceived, have you?
JHN.7.48	None
JHN.7.49	But this crowd who does not know the law is accursed!” 
JHN.7.50	Nicodemus, the one who came to him previously—who was one of them—said to them, 
JHN.7.51	“Our law does not condemn a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing, does it?”
JHN.7.52	They answered and said to him, “You are not also from Galilee, are you?
JHN.7.53	And each one went to his own house.
JHN.8.1	 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 
JHN.8.2	Now early in the morning he came again to the temple courts.
JHN.8.3	Now the scribes and the Pharisees brought to him a woman
JHN.8.4	they said to him, testing him,
JHN.8.5	Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?” 
JHN.8.6	(Now they were saying this to test him, so that they would have an occasion
JHN.8.7	And when they persisted in asking him, straightening up he said
JHN.8.8	And bending down again, he wrote on the ground. 
JHN.8.9	Now when they
JHN.8.10	So Jesus, straightening up and seeing no one except the woman,
JHN.8.11	And she said, “No one, Lord.” So Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go, and
JHN.8.12	Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world! The one who follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” 
JHN.8.13	So the Pharisees said to him, “You testify concerning yourself! Your testimony is not true.” 
JHN.8.14	Jesus answered and said to them, “Even if I testify concerning myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I have come from and where I am going. But you do not know where I have come from or where I am going. 
JHN.8.15	You judge according to externals; I do not judge anyone. 
JHN.8.16	But even if I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me. 
JHN.8.17	And even in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.
JHN.8.18	I am the one who testifies concerning myself, and the Father who sent me testifies concerning me.” 
JHN.8.19	So they were saying to him, “Where is your father?” Jesus replied, “You know neither me nor my Father! If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.” 
JHN.8.20	He spoke these words by the treasury while
JHN.8.21	So he said to them again, “I am going away, and you will seek me and will die in your sin. Where I am going you cannot come!” 
JHN.8.22	Then the Jews began to say,
JHN.8.23	And he said to them, “You are from below; I am from above. You are from this world; I am not from this world. 
JHN.8.24	Thus I said to you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.” 
JHN.8.25	So they began to say to him,
JHN.8.26	I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but the one who sent me is true, and the things which I heard from him, these things I say to the world.” 
JHN.8.27	(They did not know that he was speaking to them about the Father.) 
JHN.8.28	Then Jesus said,
JHN.8.29	And the one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do the things that are pleasing to him.” 
JHN.8.30	While
JHN.8.31	Then Jesus said to those Jews who had believed him, “If you continue in my word you are truly my disciples, 
JHN.8.32	and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” 
JHN.8.33	They replied to him, “We are descendants of Abraham and have not been enslaved to anyone at any time. How do you say, ‘You will become free’?” 
JHN.8.34	Jesus replied to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. 
JHN.8.35	And the slave does not remain in the household forever;
JHN.8.36	So if the son sets you free, you will be truly free. 
JHN.8.37	I know that you are descendants of Abraham. But you are seeking to kill me, because my word makes no progress among you. 
JHN.8.38	I speak the things that I have seen with the Father; so also you do the things that you have heard from the Father.” 
JHN.8.39	They answered and said to him, “Abraham is our father!” Jesus said to them, “If you are children of Abraham, do the deeds of Abraham! 
JHN.8.40	But now you are seeking to kill me, a man who spoke to you the truth which I heard from God. This Abraham did not do. 
JHN.8.41	You are doing the deeds of your father!” 
JHN.8.41	They said
JHN.8.42	Jesus said to them, “If God were your father, you would love me, for I have come forth from God and have come. For I have not come from myself, but that one sent me. 
JHN.8.43	Why
JHN.8.44	You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father! That one was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand firm in the truth, because truth is not in him. Whenever he speaks the lie, he speaks from his own nature,
JHN.8.45	But because I am telling the truth, you do not believe me. 
JHN.8.46	Who among you convicts me concerning sin? If I am telling the truth, why
JHN.8.47	The one who is from God listens to the words of God. Because of this you do not listen—because you are not of God.” 
JHN.8.48	The Jews answered and said to him, “Do we not correctly say that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?” 
JHN.8.49	Jesus replied, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me! 
JHN.8.50	But I do not seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges! 
JHN.8.51	Truly, truly I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never experience death forever.”
JHN.8.52	The Jews
JHN.8.53	You are not greater than our father Abraham who died, are you?
JHN.8.54	Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. The one who glorifies me is my Father, about whom you say, ‘He is our God.’ 
JHN.8.55	And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you! But I know him and I keep his word. 
JHN.8.56	Abraham your father rejoiced that he would see my day, and he saw it
JHN.8.57	So the Jews said to him, “You are
JHN.8.58	Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was, I am!” 
JHN.8.59	Then they picked up stones in order to throw them
JHN.9.1	 And as he
JHN.9.2	And his disciples asked him, saying, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?” 
JHN.9.3	Jesus replied, “Neither this man sinned nor his parents, but it happened
JHN.9.4	It is necessary for us to do the deeds of the one who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work! 
JHN.9.5	While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” 
JHN.9.6	When he
JHN.9.7	And he said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which is translated “sent”). So he went and washed and came back seeing. 
JHN.9.8	Then the neighbors and those who saw him previously (because he was a beggar) began to say,
JHN.9.9	Others were saying, “It is this man”; others were saying, “No, but he is like him.” That one was saying, “I am he!” 
JHN.9.10	So they began to say
JHN.9.11	He replied, “The man who is called Jesus made clay and smeared it
JHN.9.12	And they said to him, “Where is that man?” He said, “I do not know.” 
JHN.9.13	They brought him—the one formerly blind—to the Pharisees. 
JHN.9.14	(Now the day on which Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes was the Sabbath.) 
JHN.9.15	So the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received sight. And he said to them, “He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.” 
JHN.9.16	So some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man is not from God, because he does not observe the Sabbath!” Others
JHN.9.17	So they said to the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?” And he said, “He is a prophet.” 
JHN.9.18	So the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received sight, until they summoned the parents of the one
JHN.9.19	And they asked them, saying, “Is this man your son, whom you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?” 
JHN.9.20	So his parents answered and said, “We know that this man is our son, and that he was born blind. 
JHN.9.21	But how he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. Ask him! He is a mature adult;
JHN.9.22	(His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already decided that if anyone should confess him to be Christ, he would be expelled from the synagogue. 
JHN.9.23	Because of this his parents said, “He is a mature adult;
JHN.9.24	So they summoned the man who had been blind for the second time and said to him, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner!” 
JHN.9.25	Then that man replied, “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I know—that although I
JHN.9.26	So they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” 
JHN.9.27	He replied to them, “I told you already and you did not listen! Why do you want to hear it
JHN.9.28	They reviled
JHN.9.29	We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we do not know where this man is from.” 
JHN.9.30	The man answered and said to them, “For the remarkable thing is this, that you do not know where he is from, and he opened my eyes! 
JHN.9.31	We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if someone is devout and does his will, he listens to this one. 
JHN.9.32	From time immemorial
JHN.9.33	If this man were not from God, he would not be able to do anything!” 
JHN.9.34	They answered and said to him, “You were born completely in sin, and are you attempting to teach
JHN.9.35	Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” 
JHN.9.36	He answered and said, “And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?” 
JHN.9.37	Jesus said to him, “You have both seen him, and he is the one who is speaking with you.” 〚
JHN.9.38	And he said, “I believe, Lord!” and he worshiped him. 
JHN.9.39	And Jesus said,〛
JHN.9.40	Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things and said to him, “We are not also blind, are we?”
JHN.9.41	Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would not have sin. But now you say, ‘We see,’ your sin remains. 
JHN.10.1	 “Truly, truly I say to you, the one who does not enter through the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up at some other place—that one is a thief and a robber. 
JHN.10.2	But the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 
JHN.10.3	For this one the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 
JHN.10.4	Whenever he sends out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. 
JHN.10.5	And they will never follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.” 
JHN.10.6	Jesus told them this parable, but they did not understand what it was that he was saying to them. 
JHN.10.7	Then Jesus said to them
JHN.10.8	All those who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep do not listen to them. 
JHN.10.9	I am the door. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will come in and will go out and will find pasture. 
JHN.10.10	The thief comes only
JHN.10.11	“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. 
JHN.10.12	The hired hand, who is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf approaching and abandons the sheep and runs away—and the wolf seizes them and scatters them
JHN.10.13	because he is a hired hand and he is not concerned
JHN.10.14	“I am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me, 
JHN.10.15	just as the Father knows me and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep. 
JHN.10.16	And I have other sheep which are not from this fold. I must bring these also, and they will hear my voice, and they will become one flock—one shepherd. 
JHN.10.17	Because of this the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take possession of it again. 
JHN.10.18	No one takes it from me, but I lay it down voluntarily.
JHN.10.19	Again there was a division among the Jews because of these words. 
JHN.10.20	And many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is out of his mind! Why do you listen to him?” 
JHN.10.21	Others were saying, “These are not the words of one who is possessed by a demon! A demon is not able to open the eyes of the blind, is it?”
JHN.10.22	Then the feast of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter, 
JHN.10.23	and Jesus was walking in the temple in the Portico of Solomon. 
JHN.10.24	So the Jews surrounded him and began to say
JHN.10.25	Jesus answered them, “I told you and you do not believe! The deeds that I do in the name of my Father, these testify about me. 
JHN.10.26	But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep! 
JHN.10.27	My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. 
JHN.10.28	And I give them eternal life, and they will never perish forever,
JHN.10.29	My Father, who has given them
JHN.10.30	The Father and I are one.” 
JHN.10.31	Then
JHN.10.32	Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good deeds from the Father. For which one of them are you going to stone me?” 
JHN.10.33	The Jews answered him, “We are not going to stone you concerning a good deed, but concerning blasphemy, and because you, although you
JHN.10.34	Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, “You are gods” ’?
JHN.10.35	If he called them ‘gods’ to whom the word of God came—and the scripture cannot be broken—
JHN.10.36	do you say about he whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’? 
JHN.10.37	If I do not do the deeds of my Father, do not believe me. 
JHN.10.38	But if I am doing them,
JHN.10.39	So they were seeking again to seize him, and he departed out of their hand. 
JHN.10.40	And he went away again on the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John was baptizing at an earlier time, and he stayed there. 
JHN.10.41	And many came to him and began to say,
JHN.10.42	And many believed in him there. 
JHN.11.1	 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 
JHN.11.2	(Now it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) 
JHN.11.3	So the sisters sent word
JHN.11.4	And when he
JHN.11.5	(Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.) 
JHN.11.6	So when he heard that he was sick, then he remained in the place where
JHN.11.7	Then after this he said to the disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.” 
JHN.11.8	The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were seeking just now to stone you, and are you going there again?” 
JHN.11.9	Jesus replied, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks around in the daylight, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. 
JHN.11.10	But if anyone walks around in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him. 
JHN.11.11	He said these things, and after this he said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I can awaken him.” 
JHN.11.12	So the disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well.” 
JHN.11.13	(Now Jesus had been speaking about his death, but they thought that he was speaking about real sleep.
JHN.11.14	So Jesus then said to them plainly, “Lazarus has died, 
JHN.11.15	and I am glad for your sake
JHN.11.16	Then Thomas (the one who is called Didymus)
JHN.11.17	So when he
JHN.11.18	(Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia.
JHN.11.19	So many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary in order to console them concerning their
JHN.11.20	Now Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet him, but Mary was sitting in the house. 
JHN.11.21	So Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 
JHN.11.22	Even
JHN.11.23	Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” 
JHN.11.24	Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” 
JHN.11.25	Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, even if he dies, will live, 
JHN.11.26	and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die forever.
JHN.11.27	She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who comes into the world.” 
JHN.11.28	And when she
JHN.11.29	So that one, when she heard it,
JHN.11.30	(Now Jesus has not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha went to meet him.) 
JHN.11.31	So the Jews who were with her in the house and were consoling her, when they
JHN.11.32	Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and
JHN.11.33	Then Jesus, when he saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping, was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled within himself. 
JHN.11.34	And he said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.” 
JHN.11.35	Jesus wept. 
JHN.11.36	So the Jews were saying, “See how he loved him!” 
JHN.11.37	But some of them said, “Was not this man who opened the eyes of the blind able to do something
JHN.11.38	Then Jesus, deeply moved within himself again, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying on it. 
JHN.11.39	Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the one who had died, said to him, “Lord, he is stinking already, because it has been four days.” 
JHN.11.40	Jesus said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” 
JHN.11.41	So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his
JHN.11.42	And I know that you always hear me, but for the sake of the crowd standing around I said it,
JHN.11.43	And when he
JHN.11.44	The one who had died came out, his
JHN.11.45	Then many of the Jews who had come with Mary and saw the things which he did believed in him. 
JHN.11.46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done. 
JHN.11.47	So the chief priests and the Pharisees called together the Sanhedrin and said, “What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs! 
JHN.11.48	If we allow him to go on in this way, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place
JHN.11.49	But a certain one of them, Caiaphas (who was high priest in that year), said to them, “You do not know anything at all! 
JHN.11.50	Nor do you consider that it is profitable for you that one man should die for the people, and the whole nation not perish.” 
JHN.11.51	(Now he did not say this from himself, but being high priest in that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation, 
JHN.11.52	and not for the nation only, but also that the children of God who are scattered would be gathered into one.) 
JHN.11.53	So from that day they resolved that they should kill him. 
JHN.11.54	So Jesus was no longer walking openly among the Jews, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he stayed with the disciples. 
JHN.11.55	Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the surrounding country before the Passover, so that they could purify themselves. 
JHN.11.56	So they were looking for Jesus, and were speaking with one another while
JHN.11.57	(Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, they should report it,
JHN.12.1	 Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.2	So they made him a dinner there, and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of the ones reclining at table with him. 
JHN.12.3	Then Mary took a pound
JHN.12.4	But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was going to betray him) said, 
JHN.12.5	“Why
JHN.12.6	(Now he said this not because he was concerned
JHN.12.7	So Jesus said, “Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my preparation for burial. 
JHN.12.8	For you have the poor with you always, but you do not always have me.” 
JHN.12.9	Now a large crowd
JHN.12.10	So the chief priests decided that they would kill Lazarus also, 
JHN.12.11	because on account of him many of the Jews were going and believing in Jesus. 
JHN.12.12	On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast, when they
JHN.12.13	took the branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, and began crying out, 
JHN.12.13	“Hosanna! 
JHN.12.13	Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord,
JHN.12.13	even the king of Israel!” 
JHN.12.14	So Jesus found a young donkey and
JHN.12.15	“Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion! 
JHN.12.15	Behold, your king is coming, 
JHN.12.15	seated on the foal of a donkey!”
JHN.12.16	(His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and they did these things to him.) 
JHN.12.17	So the crowd who was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify. 
JHN.12.18	Because of this also the crowd went to meet him, for they had heard that he had performed this sign. 
JHN.12.19	So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are accomplishing nothing! Behold, the world has gone after him.” 
JHN.12.20	Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up in order to worship at the feast. 
JHN.12.21	So these approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and began asking him saying, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.” 
JHN.12.22	Philip went and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. 
JHN.12.23	And Jesus answered them, saying, “The hour has come that the Son of Man will be glorified. 
JHN.12.24	Truly, truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and
JHN.12.25	The one who loves his life loses it, and the one who hates his life in this world preserves it for eternal life. 
JHN.12.26	If anyone serves me, he must follow me, and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him. 
JHN.12.27	“Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, deliver me from this hour’? But for this reason I have come to this hour! 
JHN.12.28	Father, glorify your name!” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have both glorified it,
JHN.12.29	Now the crowd that stood there and heard it
JHN.12.30	Jesus answered and said, “This voice has not happened for my sake, but for your sake. 
JHN.12.31	Now is the judgment of this world! Now the ruler of this world will be thrown out! 
JHN.12.32	And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” 
JHN.12.33	(Now he said this to indicate by what sort of death he was going to die.) 
JHN.12.34	Then the crowd replied to him, “We have heard from the law that the Christ remains forever!
JHN.12.35	So Jesus said to them, “Yet a little time the light is with you! Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness does not overtake you! And the one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. 
JHN.12.36	While you have the light, believe in the light, in order that you may become sons of light.” Jesus said these things, and then he went away and
JHN.12.37	But as many signs as he had performed before them, they did not believe in him, 
JHN.12.38	in order that the word of the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said, 
JHN.12.38	“Lord, who has believed our message? 
JHN.12.38	And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
JHN.12.39	For this reason they were not able to believe, because again Isaiah said, 
JHN.12.40	“He has blinded their eyes 
JHN.12.40	and hardened their hearts, 
JHN.12.40	lest they see with their
JHN.12.40	and understand with their
JHN.12.40	and turn, and I heal them.”
JHN.12.41	Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory, and he spoke about him. 
JHN.12.42	Yet despite that, even many of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it,
JHN.12.43	For they loved the praise of men more than praise from God. 
JHN.12.44	But Jesus cried out and said, “The one who believes in me does not believe in me, but in the one who sent me, 
JHN.12.45	and the one who sees me sees the one who sent me. 
JHN.12.46	I have come as a light into the world, in order that everyone who believes in me will not remain in the darkness. 
JHN.12.47	And if anyone hears my words and does not observe them,
JHN.12.48	The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has one who judges him; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. 
JHN.12.49	For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father himself who sent me has commanded me
JHN.12.50	And I know that his commandment is eternal life. So the things that I say, just as the Father said to me, thus I say.” 
JHN.13.1	 Now before the feast of Passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he would depart from this world to the Father, and
JHN.13.2	And as
JHN.13.3	because he
JHN.13.4	he got up from the dinner and took off his
JHN.13.5	Then he poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them
JHN.13.6	Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” 
JHN.13.7	Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand after these things.” 
JHN.13.8	Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet forever!”
JHN.13.9	Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my
JHN.13.10	Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed only needs
JHN.13.11	(For he knew the one who would betray him; because of this he said, “Not all of you are clean.”) 
JHN.13.12	So when he had washed their feet and taken his outer clothing and reclined at table again, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done for you? 
JHN.13.13	You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and you speak correctly, for I am. 
JHN.13.14	If then I—your
JHN.13.15	For I have given you an example, that just as I have done for you, you also do. 
JHN.13.16	Truly, truly I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor a messenger greater than the one who sent him. 
JHN.13.17	If you understand these things, you are blessed if you do them. 
JHN.13.18	“I am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but in order that the scripture would be fulfilled, ‘The one who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.’
JHN.13.19	From now on I am telling you before it happens, in order that when it happens you may believe that I am he.
JHN.13.20	Truly, truly I say to you, the one who receives anyone I send receives me, and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me.” 
JHN.13.21	When he
JHN.13.22	The disciples began looking
JHN.13.23	One of his disciples—the one whom Jesus loved—was reclining close beside
JHN.13.24	So Simon Peter gestured for this one to inquire who it was about whom he was speaking. 
JHN.13.25	He leaned back
JHN.13.26	Jesus replied, “It is he to whom I dip the piece of bread and give it
JHN.13.27	And after the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, “What you are doing, do quickly!” 
JHN.13.28	(Now no one of those reclining at table knew for what reason he said this to him. 
JHN.13.29	For some were thinking because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him, “Purchase what we need
JHN.13.30	So after he
JHN.13.31	Then, when he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him. 
JHN.13.32	If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will glorify him immediately. 
JHN.13.33	Children, yet a little time I am with you. You will seek me and just as I said to the Jews, “Where I am going you cannot come,” now I say also to you. 
JHN.13.34	“A new commandment I give to you: that you love one another—just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. 
JHN.13.35	By this everyone will know that you are my disciples—if you have love for one another.” 
JHN.13.36	Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus replied,
JHN.13.37	Peter said to him, “Lord, why am I not able to follow you now? I will lay down my life for you!” 
JHN.13.38	Jesus replied, “Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly I say to you, the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times! 
JHN.14.1	 “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe
JHN.14.2	In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places; but if not, I would have told you, because
JHN.14.3	And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, so that where I am, you may be also. 
JHN.14.4	And you know the way where I am going.” 
JHN.14.5	Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How are we able to know the way?” 
JHN.14.6	Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 
JHN.14.7	If you had known me, you would have known
JHN.14.8	Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.” 
JHN.14.9	Jesus said to him, “Am I with you so long a time and you have not known me, Philip? The one who has seen me has seen the Father! How can you say, ‘Show us the Father?’ 
JHN.14.10	Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from myself, but the Father residing in me does his works. 
JHN.14.11	Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if not, believe because of the works themselves. 
JHN.14.12	Truly, truly I say to you, the one who believes in me, the works that I am doing he will do also, and he will do greater works
JHN.14.13	And whatever
JHN.14.14	If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.
JHN.14.15	“If you love me, you will keep my commandments. 
JHN.14.16	And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, in order that he may be with you forever
JHN.14.17	the Spirit of truth, whom the world is not able to receive, because it does not see him or know him.
JHN.14.18	“I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you. 
JHN.14.19	Yet a little time and the world will see me no longer, but you will see me; because I live, you also will live. 
JHN.14.20	On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. 
JHN.14.21	The one who has my commandments and keeps them—that one is the one who loves me. And the one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will reveal myself to him.” 
JHN.14.22	Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, why
JHN.14.23	Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone loves me he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and will take up residence with him.
JHN.14.24	The one who does not love me does not keep my words, and the word that you hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me. 
JHN.14.25	These things I have spoken to you while
JHN.14.26	But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name—that one will teach you all things, and will remind you of everything that I said to you. 
JHN.14.27	“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you—not as the world gives, I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let them
JHN.14.28	You have heard that I said to you, ‘I am going away, and I am coming to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am. 
JHN.14.29	And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe. 
JHN.14.30	I will no longer speak much with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has no power
JHN.14.31	But so that the world may know that I love the Father, and just as the Father has commanded me, thus I am doing. Get up, let us go from here! 
JHN.15.1	 “I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. 
JHN.15.2	Every branch that does not bear fruit in me, he removes it, and every branch that bears fruit, he prunes it in order that it may bear more fruit. 
JHN.15.3	You are already clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. 
JHN.15.4	Remain in me, and I in you. Just as the branch is not able to bear fruit from itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me. 
JHN.15.5	“I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me and I in him—this one bears much fruit, for apart from me you are not able to do anything. 
JHN.15.6	If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and dries up, and they gather them and throw them
JHN.15.7	If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you want and it will be done for you. 
JHN.15.8	My Father is glorified by this: that you bear much fruit, and prove to be my disciples. 
JHN.15.9	“Just as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love. 
JHN.15.10	If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love. 
JHN.15.11	I have spoken these things to you in order that my joy may be in you, and your joy may be made complete. 
JHN.15.12	This is my commandment: that you love one another just as I have loved you. 
JHN.15.13	No one has greater love than this: that someone lay down his life for his friends. 
JHN.15.14	You are my friends if you do what I command you. 
JHN.15.15	No longer do I call you slaves, because the slave does not know what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because everything that I have heard from my Father I have revealed to you. 
JHN.15.16	You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and your fruit should remain, in order that whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you. 
JHN.15.17	These things I command you: that you love one another. 
JHN.15.18	If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated
JHN.15.19	If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, for this reason the world hates you. 
JHN.15.20	Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A slave is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also. 
JHN.15.21	But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know the one who sent me. 
JHN.15.22	If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin. But now they do not have a valid excuse for their sin. 
JHN.15.23	The one who hates me hates my Father also. 
JHN.15.24	If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have sin. But now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father. 
JHN.15.25	But this happened
JHN.15.26	“When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father—that one will testify about me. 
JHN.15.27	And you also will testify, because you have been with me from the beginning. 
JHN.16.1	 “I have said these things to you so that you will not fall away. 
JHN.16.2	They will expel you from the synagogue,
JHN.16.3	And they will do these things because they do not know the Father or me. 
JHN.16.4	But I have said these things to you so that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told you about them. 
JHN.16.4	“And I have not said these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. 
JHN.16.5	But now I am going away to the one who sent me, and none of you is asking me, ‘Where are you going?’ 
JHN.16.6	But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts. 
JHN.16.7	But I tell you the truth, it is better for you that I go away. For if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. 
JHN.16.8	And when he
JHN.16.9	concerning sin, because they do not believe in me, 
JHN.16.10	and concerning righteousness, because I am going away to the Father and you will see me no more, 
JHN.16.11	and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned. 
JHN.16.12	I still have many things to say to you, but you are not able to bear them
JHN.16.13	But when he—the Spirit of truth—comes, he will guide you into all the truth. For he will not speak from himself, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will proclaim to you the things to come. 
JHN.16.14	He will glorify me, because he will take from what is mine and will proclaim it
JHN.16.15	Everything that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he takes from what is mine and will proclaim it
JHN.16.16	“A little while and you will see me no more, and again a little while and you will see me. 
JHN.16.17	So some of his disciples said to one another, “What is this that he is saying to us, ‘A little while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me,’ and ‘Because I am going away to the Father’?” 
JHN.16.18	So they kept on saying, “What is this that he is saying, ‘A little while’? We do not understand what he is speaking about!” 
JHN.16.19	Jesus knew that they were wanting to ask him, and he said to them, “Are you deliberating with one another about this—that I said, ‘A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me’? 
JHN.16.20	Truly, truly I say to you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will become sorrowful, but your sorrow will change to joy. 
JHN.16.21	A woman, when she gives birth, experiences pain because her hour has come. But when her
JHN.16.22	So you also are experiencing sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy from you. 
JHN.16.23	And on that day you will ask me nothing. Truly, truly I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give you. 
JHN.16.24	Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete. 
JHN.16.25	“I have said these things to you in figurative sayings. An hour is coming when I will speak to you in figurative sayings no longer, but I will tell you plainly about the Father. 
JHN.16.26	On that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf. 
JHN.16.27	For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. 
JHN.16.28	I have gone out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and am going to the Father.” 
JHN.16.29	His disciples said, “Behold, now you are speaking plainly
JHN.16.30	Now we know that you know everything and do not need for
JHN.16.31	Jesus replied to them, “Now do you believe? 
JHN.16.32	Behold, an hour is coming—and has come—that you will be scattered each one to his own home,
JHN.16.33	I have said these things to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but have courage! I have conquered the world.” 
JHN.17.1	 Jesus said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven he said, “Father, the hour has come! Glorify your Son, in order that your Son may glorify you—
JHN.17.2	just as you have given him authority over all flesh, in order that he would give eternal life to them—everyone whom you have given him. 
JHN.17.3	Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. 
JHN.17.4	I have glorified you on earth by
JHN.17.5	And now, Father, you glorify me at your side
JHN.17.6	“I have revealed your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me, and they have kept your word. 
JHN.17.7	Now they understand that all the things that
JHN.17.8	because the words that you gave to me I have given to them, and they received them
JHN.17.9	I am asking on behalf of them. I am not asking on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those whom you have given me, because they are yours, 
JHN.17.10	and all my things are yours, and your things are mine, and I have been glorified in
JHN.17.11	And I am no longer in the world, and they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given to me, so that they may be one, just as we are. 
JHN.17.12	When I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given to me, and guarded them,
JHN.17.13	And now I am coming to you, and I am saying these things in the world so that they may have my joy completed in themselves. 
JHN.17.14	I have given them your word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world just as I am not of the world. 
JHN.17.15	I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you protect them from the evil one. 
JHN.17.16	They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. 
JHN.17.17	Sanctify them in the truth—your word is truth. 
JHN.17.18	Just as you sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world. 
JHN.17.19	And for them I sanctify myself, so that they themselves also may be sanctified in the truth. 
JHN.17.20	“And I do not ask on behalf of these only, but also on behalf of those who believe in me through their word, 
JHN.17.21	that they all may be one, just as you, Father, are in me and I am in you, that they also may be in us, in order that the world may believe that you sent me. 
JHN.17.22	And the glory that you have given to me, I have given to them, in order that they may be one, just as we are one—
JHN.17.23	I in them, and you in me, in order that they may be completed in one, so that the world may know that you sent me, and you have loved them just as you have loved me. 
JHN.17.24	“Father, those whom you have given to me—I want that those also may be with me where I am, in order that they may see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world. 
JHN.17.25	Righteous Father, although the world does not know you, yet I have known you, and these men have come to know that you sent me. 
JHN.17.26	And I made known to them your name, and will make it
JHN.18.1	 When
JHN.18.2	(Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, also knew about the place, because Jesus often gathered there with his disciples.) 
JHN.18.3	So Judas, taking the cohort and officers from the chief priests and from the Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons. 
JHN.18.4	Then Jesus, because he
JHN.18.5	They replied to him, “Jesus the Nazarene.” He said to them, “I am he.”
JHN.18.6	So when he said to them, “I am he,”
JHN.18.7	Then he asked them again, “Who are you looking for?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.” 
JHN.18.8	Jesus replied, “I said to you that I am he!
JHN.18.9	in order that the word that he had spoken would be fulfilled: “Those whom you have given to me—I have not lost anyone of them.”
JHN.18.10	Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. (Now the name of the slave was Malchus.) 
JHN.18.11	So Jesus said to Peter, “Put the sword into its
JHN.18.12	Then the cohort and the military tribune and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and tied him up, 
JHN.18.13	and brought him
JHN.18.14	(Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was better that one man die for the people.) 
JHN.18.15	So Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. (Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.) 
JHN.18.16	But Peter was standing by the door outside. So the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in. 
JHN.18.17	Then the female slave who was the doorkeeper said to Peter, “You are not also one of the disciples of this man, are you?”
JHN.18.18	(Now the slaves and the officers were standing there, having made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. And Peter was also standing there with them and warming himself.) 
JHN.18.19	So the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. 
JHN.18.20	Jesus replied to him, “I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple courts
JHN.18.21	Why are you asking me? Ask those who heard what I have said to them! Behold, these people know what I said.” 
JHN.18.22	Now when
JHN.18.23	Jesus replied to him, “If I have spoken wrongly, testify about what is wrong! But if I have spoken
JHN.18.24	Then Annas sent him, tied up, to Caiaphas the high priest. 
JHN.18.25	Now Simon Peter was standing there and warming himself. So they said to him, “You are not also one of his disciples, are you?”
JHN.18.26	One of the slaves of the high priest, who was related to the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?” 
JHN.18.27	So Peter denied it
JHN.18.28	Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s residence. Now it was early, and they did not enter into the governor’s residence so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover. 
JHN.18.29	So Pilate came outside to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?” 
JHN.18.30	They answered and said to him, “If this man were not doing evil, we would not have handed him over to you!” 
JHN.18.31	So Pilate said to them, “You take him and judge him according to your law!” The Jews said to him, “It is not permitted for us to kill anyone,” 
JHN.18.32	in order that the word of Jesus would be fulfilled that he had spoken, indicating by what sort of death he was going to die. 
JHN.18.33	Then Pilate entered again into the governor’s residence and summoned Jesus and said to him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” 
JHN.18.34	Jesus replied, “Do you say this from yourself, or have others said this
JHN.18.35	Pilate replied, “I am not a Jew, am I?
JHN.18.36	Jesus replied, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.” 
JHN.18.37	Then Pilate said to him, “So then you are a king!” Jesus replied, “You say that I am a king. For this reason I was born, and for this reason I have come into the world: in order that I can testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.” 
JHN.18.38	Pilate said to him, “What is truth?” 
JHN.18.38	And when he
JHN.18.39	But it is your custom that I release for you one prisoner
JHN.18.40	Then they shouted again, saying, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” (Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.)
JHN.19.1	 So then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.
JHN.19.2	And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and placed it
JHN.19.3	and were coming up to him and saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!” and were giving him slaps in the face. 
JHN.19.4	And Pilate came outside again and said to them, “Behold, I am bringing him outside to you, so that you will know that I find no basis for an accusation against him.” 
JHN.19.5	Then Jesus came outside wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, and he said to them, “Behold the man!” 
JHN.19.6	So when they saw him, the chief priests and the officers shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify!” Pilate said to them, “You take him and crucify him!
JHN.19.7	The Jews replied to him, “We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself out to be the Son of God!” 
JHN.19.8	So when Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid, 
JHN.19.9	and he entered into the governor’s residence again and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus did not give him an answer. 
JHN.19.10	So Pilate said to him, “Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I have authority to crucify you?” 
JHN.19.11	Jesus replied to him, “You would not have any authority over me unless it was given to you from above. For this reason the one who handed me over to you has greater sin.” 
JHN.19.12	From this point on Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews shouted, saying, “If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar! Everyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes Caesar!” 
JHN.19.13	So Pilate, when he
JHN.19.14	(Now it was the day of preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, “Behold your king!” 
JHN.19.15	Then those shouted, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your king?” The chief priests replied, “We do not have a king except Caesar!” 
JHN.19.16	So then he handed him over to them in order that he could be crucified. 
JHN.19.16	So they took Jesus, 
JHN.19.17	and carrying for himself the cross, he went out to the place called The Place of a Skull (which is called 
JHN.19.18	where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side,
JHN.19.19	And Pilate also wrote a notice and placed it
JHN.19.20	So many of the Jews read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek. 
JHN.19.21	Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews,’ but, ‘He said, I am king of the Jews.’ ” 
JHN.19.22	Pilate replied, “What I have written, I have written.” 
JHN.19.23	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothing and made four shares—for each soldier a share—and the tunic. (Now the tunic was seamless, woven from the top in a single piece.)
JHN.19.24	So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it apart, but cast lots for it, to see whose it will be,” so that the scripture would be fulfilled that says, 
JHN.19.24	“They divided my garments among themselves, 
JHN.19.24	and for my clothing they cast lots.”
JHN.19.24	Thus the soldiers did these things. 
JHN.19.25	Now his mother and the sister of his mother, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene were standing near the cross of Jesus. 
JHN.19.26	So Jesus, seeing his
JHN.19.27	Then he said to the disciple, “Behold your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home. 
JHN.19.28	After this, Jesus, knowing that now at last everything was completed, in order that the scripture would be fulfilled, said, “I am thirsty.” 
JHN.19.29	A jar full of sour wine was standing there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and
JHN.19.30	Then when he had received the sour wine, Jesus said, “It is completed,”
JHN.19.31	Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an important day), asked Pilate that their legs could be broken and they could be taken away. 
JHN.19.32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him. 
JHN.19.33	But when they
JHN.19.34	But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water came out immediately. 
JHN.19.35	And the one who has seen it
JHN.19.36	For these things happened in order that the scripture would be fulfilled: “Not a bone of his will be broken.”
JHN.19.37	And again another scripture says, “They will look on the one whom they have pierced.”
JHN.19.38	And after these things, Joseph who was from Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (but a secret one for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate allowed it,
JHN.19.39	And Nicodemus—the one who had come to him formerly at night—also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds.
JHN.19.40	So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in strips of linen cloth with the fragrant spices, as is the Jews’ custom to prepare for burial. 
JHN.19.41	Now there was a garden at the place where he was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one was yet buried. 
JHN.19.42	So there, on account of the day of preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was close by, they buried Jesus. 
JHN.20.1	 Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it
JHN.20.2	So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them, “They have taken away the Lord from the tomb and we do not know where they have put him!” 
JHN.20.3	Then Peter and the other disciple went out and were going to the tomb. 
JHN.20.4	And the two were running together, and the other disciple ran ahead, faster than Peter, and came to the tomb first. 
JHN.20.5	And bending over to look, he saw the strips of linen cloth lying there, though he did not go in. 
JHN.20.6	Then Simon Peter also came following him, and he went into the tomb and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there, 
JHN.20.7	and the facecloth that was on his head—not lying with the strips of linen cloth, but folded up separately in one place. 
JHN.20.8	So then the other disciple who had come to the tomb first also went in, and he saw and believed. 
JHN.20.9	(For they did not yet know the scripture that it was necessary for him to rise from the dead.) 
JHN.20.10	Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.
JHN.20.11	But Mary stood outside at the tomb, weeping. Then, while she was weeping, she bent over to look into the tomb, 
JHN.20.12	and she saw two angels in white, seated one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been lying. 
JHN.20.13	And they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him!” 
JHN.20.14	When she
JHN.20.15	Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” She thought that it was the gardener, and
JHN.20.16	Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned around and
JHN.20.17	Jesus said to her, “Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.’ ” 
JHN.20.18	Mary Magdalene came and
JHN.20.19	Now when it
JHN.20.20	And when he
JHN.20.21	So Jesus said to them again, “Peace to you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you.” 
JHN.20.22	And when he
JHN.20.23	If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them. If you retain the sins
JHN.20.24	Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called Didymus,
JHN.20.25	So the other disciples said to him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe!” 
JHN.20.26	And after eight days his disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Although
JHN.20.27	Then he said to Thomas, “Place your finger here and see my hands, and place your hand and put it
JHN.20.28	Thomas answered and said to him, “My Lord and my God!” 
JHN.20.29	Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen me, have you believed? Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.” 
JHN.20.30	Now Jesus also performed many other signs in the presence of the disciples
JHN.20.31	but these things are recorded in order that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by
JHN.21.1	 After these things Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. Now he revealed himself
JHN.21.2	Simon Peter and Thomas (who was called Didymus)
JHN.21.3	Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing!” They said to him, “We also are coming with you.” They went out and got into the boat, and during that night they caught nothing. 
JHN.21.4	Now when it
JHN.21.5	So Jesus said to them, “Children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you?
JHN.21.6	And he said to them, “Throw the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”
JHN.21.7	Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” So Simon Peter, when he
JHN.21.8	But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net of fish, because they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits
JHN.21.9	So when they got out on the land, they saw a charcoal fire laid there, and a fish lying on it,
JHN.21.10	Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught.” 
JHN.21.11	So Simon Peter got into the boat
JHN.21.12	Jesus said to them, “Come, eat breakfast!” But none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” because they
JHN.21.13	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it
JHN.21.14	This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he
JHN.21.15	Now when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs!” 
JHN.21.16	He said to him again a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Shepherd my sheep!” 
JHN.21.17	He said to him a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter was distressed because he said to him a third time, “Do you love me?” and he said to him, “Lord, you know everything! You know that I love you!” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep! 
JHN.21.18	Truly, truly I say to you, when you were young, you tied your clothes
JHN.21.19	(Now he said this to indicate by what kind of death he would glorify God.) And after he
JHN.21.20	Peter turned and
JHN.21.21	So when he
JHN.21.22	Jesus said to him, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that
JHN.21.23	So this saying went out to the brothers that that disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that
JHN.21.24	This is the disciple who is testifying about these things, and who has written down these things. And we know that his testimony is true. 
JHN.21.25	Now there are also many other things that Jesus did, which—if they were written down one after the other—I suppose not even the world itself could contain the books that would be written. 
ACT.1.1	 I produced the former account, O Theophilus, about all that
ACT.1.2	until the day he was taken up, after he
ACT.1.3	to whom he also presented himself alive after he suffered, with many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking the things about the kingdom of God. 
ACT.1.4	And while he
ACT.1.5	For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”
ACT.1.6	So when
ACT.1.7	But he said to them, “It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has set by his own authority. 
ACT.1.8	But you will receive power when
ACT.1.9	And after he
ACT.1.10	And as they were staring into the sky while
ACT.1.11	who also said, “Men of Galilee,
ACT.1.12	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain that is called Olive Grove
ACT.1.13	And when they had entered, they went up to the upstairs room where they were staying—Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas son of James. 
ACT.1.14	All these were busily engaged with one mind in prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with
ACT.1.15	And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers (and it was a crowd of persons of about one hundred twenty at the same place) and
ACT.1.16	“Men and brothers, it was necessary that the scripture be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit proclaimed beforehand through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus, 
ACT.1.17	because he was counted among us and received a share in this ministry.” 
ACT.1.18	(Now this man acquired a field for the wages of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines spilled out. 
ACT.1.19	And it became known to all who live in Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own language
ACT.1.20	“For it is written in the book of Psalms, 
ACT.1.20	‘Let his residence become deserted, 
ACT.1.20	and let there be no one to live in it,’
ACT.1.20	and, 
ACT.1.20	‘Let another person take his position.’
ACT.1.21	Therefore it is necessary for one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us, 
ACT.1.22	beginning from the baptism of John until the day on which he was taken up from us—one of these men must become a witness of his resurrection together with us.” 
ACT.1.23	And they proposed two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was called Justus) and Matthias. 
ACT.1.24	And they prayed and
ACT.1.25	to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to depart to his own place.” 
ACT.1.26	And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was added to serve
ACT.2.1	 And when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in the same place. 
ACT.2.2	And suddenly a sound like a violent rushing wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. 
ACT.2.3	And divided
ACT.2.4	And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages
ACT.2.5	Now there were Jews residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven. 
ACT.2.6	And when
ACT.2.7	And they were astounded and astonished, saying, “Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans? 
ACT.2.8	And how do we hear, each one of us, in our own native language?
ACT.2.9	Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those residing in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
ACT.2.10	Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya toward Cyrene, and the Romans who were in town, 
ACT.2.11	both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs—we hear them speaking in our own languages the great deeds of God!” 
ACT.2.12	And all were amazed and greatly perplexed, saying to one another,
ACT.2.13	But others jeered and
ACT.2.14	But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them, “Judean men, and all those who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and pay attention to my words! 
ACT.2.15	For these men are not drunk, as you assume, because it is the third hour of the day. 
ACT.2.16	But this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel: 
ACT.2.17	‘And it will be in the last days,’ God says, 
ACT.2.17	‘I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, 
ACT.2.17	and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, 
ACT.2.17	and your young men will see visions, 
ACT.2.17	and your old men will dream dreams. 
ACT.2.18	And even on my male slaves and on my female slaves 
ACT.2.18	I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. 
ACT.2.19	And I will cause wonders in the heaven
ACT.2.19	and signs on the earth below, 
ACT.2.19	blood and fire and vapor of smoke. 
ACT.2.20	The sun will be changed to darkness 
ACT.2.20	and the moon to blood, 
ACT.2.20	before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes. 
ACT.2.21	And it will be that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.’
ACT.2.22	“Israelite men, listen to these words! Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, just as you yourselves know—
ACT.2.23	this man, delivered up by the determined plan and foreknowledge of God, you executed by
ACT.2.24	God raised him
ACT.2.25	For David says with reference to him, 
ACT.2.25	‘I saw the Lord before me continually,
ACT.2.25	for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken. 
ACT.2.26	For this reason my heart was glad 
ACT.2.26	and my tongue rejoiced greatly, 
ACT.2.26	furthermore also my flesh will live in hope, 
ACT.2.27	because you will not abandon my soul in Hades, 
ACT.2.27	nor will you permit your Holy One to experience decay. 
ACT.2.28	You have made known to me the paths of life; 
ACT.2.28	you will fill me with gladness with your presence.’
ACT.2.29	“Men and brothers, it is possible to speak with confidence to you about the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us until this day. 
ACT.2.30	Therefore, because he
ACT.2.31	by
ACT.2.32	This Jesus God raised up, of which
ACT.2.33	Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out this that you see and hear.
ACT.2.34	For David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says, 
ACT.2.34	‘The Lord said to my Lord, 
ACT.2.34	“Sit at my right hand, 
ACT.2.35	until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.” ’
ACT.2.36	Therefore let all the house of Israel know beyond a doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified!” 
ACT.2.37	Now when they
ACT.2.38	And Peter said
ACT.2.39	For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all those who are far away, as many as the Lord our God calls to himself.” 
ACT.2.40	And with many other words he solemnly urged and exhorted them, saying, “Be saved from this crooked generation!” 
ACT.2.41	So those who accepted his message were baptized, and on that day about three thousand souls were added. 
ACT.2.42	And they were devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayers. 
ACT.2.43	And fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were being performed by the apostles. 
ACT.2.44	And all who believed were in the same place, and had everything in common. 
ACT.2.45	And they began selling
ACT.2.46	And every day, devoting themselves to meeting
ACT.2.47	praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding every day to the total of those who were being saved. 
ACT.3.1	 Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. 
ACT.3.2	And a certain man was being carried who was lame from birth.
ACT.3.3	When he
ACT.3.4	And Peter looked intently at him, together with John, and
ACT.3.5	So he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them. 
ACT.3.6	But Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not possess,
ACT.3.7	And taking hold of him by the right hand, he raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. 
ACT.3.8	And leaping up, he stood and began walking around
ACT.3.9	And all the people saw him walking and praising God, 
ACT.3.10	And they recognized him, that this one
ACT.3.11	And while
ACT.3.12	And when he
ACT.3.13	The God of Abraham and of Isaac
ACT.3.14	But you denied the Holy and Righteous One and demanded that a man—a murderer—be granted to you. 
ACT.3.15	And you killed the originator of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses! 
ACT.3.16	And on the basis of faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know, and the faith that is through him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all. 
ACT.3.17	And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did also. 
ACT.3.18	But the things which God foretold through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ
ACT.3.19	Therefore repent and turn back, so that your sins may be blotted out, 
ACT.3.20	so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and he may send the Christ
ACT.3.21	whom heaven must receive until the times of the restoration of all things, about which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times. 
ACT.3.22	Moses said, ‘The Lord God
ACT.3.23	And it will be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet will be destroyed utterly from the people.’
ACT.3.24	And indeed, all the prophets from Samuel and all those who followed him
ACT.3.25	You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God ordained with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed.’
ACT.3.26	God, after he
ACT.4.1	 And while
ACT.4.2	greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 
ACT.4.3	And they laid hands on them and put them
ACT.4.4	But many of those who listened to the message believed, and the number of the men was approximately five thousand. 
ACT.4.5	And it happened that on the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes came together in Jerusalem, 
ACT.4.6	and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all those who were from the high priest’s family. 
ACT.4.7	And they made them stand in their
ACT.4.8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders, 
ACT.4.9	if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a sick man—by what means
ACT.4.10	let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead—by him this man stands before you healthy! 
ACT.4.11	This one
ACT.4.12	And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven that is given among people by which we must be saved.” 
ACT.4.13	Now when they
ACT.4.14	And because they
ACT.4.15	But after they
ACT.4.16	saying, “What should we do with these men? For that a remarkable sign has taken place through them is evident to all those who live in Jerusalem, and we are not able to deny it!
ACT.4.17	But in order that it may not spread much further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more in this name to anyone at all.”
ACT.4.18	And they called them back and
ACT.4.19	But Peter and John answered and
ACT.4.20	For we are not able to refrain from speaking about the things that we have seen and heard.” 
ACT.4.21	So after
ACT.4.22	For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old. 
ACT.4.23	And when they
ACT.4.24	And when they
ACT.4.25	the one who said by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of our father David, your servant, 
ACT.4.25	‘Why do the nations
ACT.4.25	and the peoples conspire in vain? 
ACT.4.26	The kings of the earth stood opposed, 
ACT.4.26	and the rulers assembled together at the same place, 
ACT.4.26	against the Lord and against his Christ.’
ACT.4.27	For in truth both Herod and Pontius Pilate, together with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, assembled together in this city against your holy servant Jesus whom you anointed, 
ACT.4.28	to do all that your hand and plan
ACT.4.29	And now, Lord, concern yourself with their threats and grant your slaves to speak your message with all boldness, 
ACT.4.30	as you extend your hand to heal and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.” 
ACT.4.31	And when
ACT.4.32	Now the group of those who believed were one heart and soul, and no one said anything of what belonged to him was his own, but all things were theirs in common. 
ACT.4.33	And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was on them all. 
ACT.4.34	For there was not even anyone needy among them, because all those who were owners of plots of land or houses were selling them
ACT.4.35	and placing them
ACT.4.36	So Joseph, who was called Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated “son of encouragement”), a Levite of Cyprus by nationality, 
ACT.4.37	sold a field
ACT.5.1	 Now a certain man named
ACT.5.2	and he kept back for himself some of the proceeds, and his
ACT.5.3	But Peter said, “Ananias, for what reason has Satan filled your heart, that you lied to the Holy Spirit and kept back for yourself some of the proceeds of the piece of land? 
ACT.5.4	When it
ACT.5.5	And when
ACT.5.6	So the young men stood up, wrapped him up, and carried him
ACT.5.7	And it happened that there was an interval of about three hours, and his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 
ACT.5.8	And Peter said to her, “Tell me whether you both
ACT.5.9	So Peter said to her, “How is it that it was agreed by you two
ACT.5.10	And immediately she fell down at his feet and died. So when
ACT.5.11	And great fear came on the whole church and on all who heard about these things. 
ACT.5.12	Now many signs and wonders were being performed among the people through the hands of the apostles. And they were all together
ACT.5.13	And none of the rest dared to join them, but the people spoke highly of them. 
ACT.5.14	And even more believers in the Lord
ACT.5.15	so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and put them
ACT.5.16	And the people of the towns around Jerusalem also came together, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, who were all being healed. 
ACT.5.17	Now the high priest rose up and all those who were with him (that is, the party of the Sadducees), and
ACT.5.18	And they laid hands on the apostles and put them in the public prison. 
ACT.5.19	But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison and led them out and
ACT.5.20	“Go and stand in the temple courts
ACT.5.21	And when they
ACT.5.21	Now when
ACT.5.22	But the officers who came
ACT.5.23	saying, “We found the prison locked with all security and the guards standing at the doors, but when we
ACT.5.24	Now when both the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed concerning them, as to what this might be. 
ACT.5.25	But someone came and
ACT.5.26	Then the captain went with the officers and
ACT.5.27	And when they
ACT.5.28	saying, “We strictly commanded
ACT.5.29	But Peter and the apostles answered and
ACT.5.30	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed by
ACT.5.31	This one God has exalted to his right hand as Leader and Savior to grant repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. 
ACT.5.32	And we are witnesses of these things, and so is
ACT.5.33	Now when
ACT.5.34	But a certain man stood up in the Sanhedrin,
ACT.5.35	And he said to them, “Men and Israelites, take care for yourselves what you are about to do to these men! 
ACT.5.36	For before these days, Theudas rose up saying he was somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him.
ACT.5.37	After this man, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and caused people to follow him in revolt.
ACT.5.38	And now I tell you, keep away from these men, and leave them alone, because if this plan or this matter is from people, it will be overthrown.
ACT.5.39	But if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them, lest you even be found fighting against God.” So they were persuaded by him. 
ACT.5.40	And they summoned the apostles, beat them,
ACT.5.41	So they went out from the presence of the Sanhedrin
ACT.5.42	Every day, both in the temple courts
ACT.6.1	 Now in these days, as
ACT.6.2	So the twelve summoned the community of disciples and
ACT.6.3	So, brothers, select from among you seven men of good reputation,
ACT.6.4	But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” 
ACT.6.5	And the statement pleased the whole group, and they chose Stephen (a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit), and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus (a convert from Antioch), 
ACT.6.6	whom they stood before the apostles. And they prayed and
ACT.6.7	And the word of God kept spreading, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem was increasing greatly, and a large number of priests began obeying
ACT.6.8	Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people. 
ACT.6.9	But some of those from the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called),
ACT.6.10	And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking. 
ACT.6.11	Then they secretly instigated men who said, “We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God!” 
ACT.6.12	And they incited the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came up and
ACT.6.13	And they put forward false witnesses who said, “This man does not stop speaking words against the holy place
ACT.6.14	For we have heard him saying that this Nazarene Jesus will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses handed down to us.” 
ACT.6.15	And as they
ACT.7.1	 And the high priest said, “Is it so concerning these things?” 
ACT.7.2	So he said, “Men—brothers and fathers—listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he
ACT.7.3	and said to him, ‘Go out from your land and from your relatives and come to the land that I will show you.’ 
ACT.7.4	Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and
ACT.7.5	And he did not give him an inheritance in it—not even a footstep
ACT.7.6	But God spoke like this: ‘His descendants will be foreigners in a foreign land, and they will enslave them and mistreat them
ACT.7.7	and the nation that
ACT.7.8	And he gave him the covenant of circumcision, and so he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac did so with
ACT.7.9	And the patriarchs, because they
ACT.7.10	and rescued him from all his afflictions and granted him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he appointed him ruler over Egypt and all
ACT.7.11	And a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan and great affliction, and our fathers could not find food. 
ACT.7.12	So when
ACT.7.13	And on the second visit
ACT.7.14	So Joseph sent and
ACT.7.15	And Jacob went down to Egypt and died, he and our fathers. 
ACT.7.16	And they were brought back to Shechem and buried in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem. 
ACT.7.17	“But as the time of the promise that God had made to Abraham was drawing near, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt 
ACT.7.18	until another king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph. 
ACT.7.19	This man deceitfully took advantage of our
ACT.7.20	At this time Moses was born, and he was beautiful to God. He
ACT.7.21	and when
ACT.7.22	And Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was powerful in his words and deeds. 
ACT.7.23	“But when he was forty years old,
ACT.7.24	And when he
ACT.7.25	And he thought his
ACT.7.26	And on the following day, he made an appearance to them while they
ACT.7.27	But the one who was doing wrong to his
ACT.7.28	You do not want to do away with me the same way
ACT.7.29	And at this statement, Moses fled and became a foreigner in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons. 
ACT.7.30	“And when
ACT.7.31	And when
ACT.7.32	‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob!’
ACT.7.33	And the Lord said to him, ‘Untie the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground. 
ACT.7.34	I have certainly seen
ACT.7.35	This Moses whom they had repudiated, saying, ‘Who appointed you a ruler and a judge?’
ACT.7.36	This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years. 
ACT.7.37	“This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers.’
ACT.7.38	This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and who with our fathers received living oracles to give to us, 
ACT.7.39	to whom our fathers were not willing to become obedient, but rejected him
ACT.7.40	saying to Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will go on before us! For this Moses, who led us out from the land of Egypt—we do not know what has happened to him!’
ACT.7.41	And they manufactured a calf in those days, and offered up a sacrifice to the idol, and began rejoicing
ACT.7.42	But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, just as it is written in the book of the prophets: 
ACT.7.42	‘You did not bring offerings and sacrifices to me 
ACT.7.42	for forty years in the wilderness, did you,
ACT.7.43	And you took along the tabernacle
ACT.7.43	and the star of the god
ACT.7.43	the images that you made, to worship them, 
ACT.7.43	and I will deport you beyond Babylon!’
ACT.7.44	The tabernacle of the testimony belonged
ACT.7.45	and which, after
ACT.7.46	who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.
ACT.7.47	But Solomon built a house for him. 
ACT.7.48	But the Most High does not live in houses
ACT.7.49	‘Heaven is my throne 
ACT.7.49	and earth is the footstool for my feet. 
ACT.7.49	What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, 
ACT.7.49	or what is the place of my rest? 
ACT.7.50	Did not my hand make all these things?’
ACT.7.51	“You stiff-necked people and uncircumcised in hearts and in your
ACT.7.52	Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand about the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become, 
ACT.7.53	you who received the law by directions of angels and have not observed it!” 
ACT.7.54	Now when they
ACT.7.55	But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked intently into heaven and
ACT.7.56	And he said, “Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!” 
ACT.7.57	But crying out with a loud voice, they stopped their ears and rushed at him with one purpose. 
ACT.7.58	And after they
ACT.7.59	And they kept on stoning Stephen as he
ACT.7.60	And falling to his
ACT.8.1	 And Saul was agreeing with his murder. Now there happened on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. 
ACT.8.2	And devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation over him. 
ACT.8.3	But Saul was attempting to destroy the church. Entering house after house,
ACT.8.4	Now those who had been scattered went about proclaiming the good news of the word. 
ACT.8.5	And Philip came down to the city of Samaria and
ACT.8.6	And the crowds with one mind were paying attention to what was being said by Philip, as they heard him
ACT.8.7	For many of those who had unclean spirits, they were coming out of them,
ACT.8.8	And there was great joy in that city. 
ACT.8.9	Now a certain man named
ACT.8.10	They were all paying attention to him,
ACT.8.11	And they were paying attention to him because for a long time he had astonished them with his
ACT.8.12	But when they believed Philip as he
ACT.8.13	And Simon himself also believed, and after he
ACT.8.14	Now when
ACT.8.15	who went down and
ACT.8.16	(For he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized
ACT.8.17	Then they placed their
ACT.8.18	Now Simon, when he
ACT.8.19	saying, “Give to me also this power, so that whomever I place my
ACT.8.20	But Peter said to him, “May your silver be destroyed along with you,
ACT.8.21	You have no
ACT.8.22	Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and ask the Lord if perhaps the intent of your heart may be forgiven you!” 
ACT.8.23	For I see you are in a state of bitter envy
ACT.8.24	But Simon answered and
ACT.8.25	So when
ACT.8.26	Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, “Get up and go toward the south
ACT.8.27	And he got up and
ACT.8.28	and was returning and sitting in his chariot, and reading aloud the prophet Isaiah. 
ACT.8.29	And the Spirit said to Philip, “Approach and join this chariot.” 
ACT.8.30	So Philip ran up to it
ACT.8.31	And he said, “So how could I, unless someone will guide me?” And he invited Philip to come up and
ACT.8.32	Now the passage of scripture that he was reading aloud was this: 
ACT.8.32	“He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, 
ACT.8.32	and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, 
ACT.8.32	so he did not open his mouth. 
ACT.8.33	In his
ACT.8.33	Who can describe his descendants?
ACT.8.33	For his life was taken away from the earth.”
ACT.8.34	And the eunuch answered and
ACT.8.35	So Philip opened his mouth and beginning from this scripture, proclaimed the good news to him about Jesus. 
ACT.8.36	And as they were traveling down the road, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?”
ACT.8.38	And he ordered the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water—Philip and the eunuch—and he baptized him. 
ACT.8.39	And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him any longer, for he went on his way rejoicing. 
ACT.8.40	But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he
ACT.9.1	 But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest 
ACT.9.2	and
ACT.9.3	Now as he proceeded, it happened that when he approached Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. 
ACT.9.4	And falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” 
ACT.9.5	So he said, “Who are you, Lord?” And he said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting! 
ACT.9.6	But get up and enter into the city, and it will be told to you what you must do.”
ACT.9.7	(Now the men who were traveling together with him stood speechless, because they
ACT.9.8	So Saul got up from the ground, but although
ACT.9.9	And he was unable to see
ACT.9.10	Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus named
ACT.9.11	And the Lord said to him, “Get up, go to the street called ‘Straight’ and in the house of Judas look for a man named Saul from Tarsus.
ACT.9.12	and he has seen in a vision a man named
ACT.9.13	But Ananias replied, “Lord, I have heard from many people about this man, how much harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem, 
ACT.9.14	and here he has authority from the chief priests to tie up
ACT.9.15	But the Lord said to him, “Go, because this man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before Gentiles
ACT.9.16	For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.” 
ACT.9.17	So Ananias departed and entered into the house, and placing his
ACT.9.18	And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight and got up and
ACT.9.19	and after
ACT.9.20	And immediately he began proclaiming
ACT.9.21	And all who heard him
ACT.9.22	But Saul was increasing in strength even more, and was confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus by
ACT.9.23	And when many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted to do away with him. 
ACT.9.24	But their plot became known to Saul, and they were also watching the gates both day and night so that they could do away with him. 
ACT.9.25	But his disciples took him
ACT.9.26	And when he
ACT.9.27	But Barnabas took him and
ACT.9.28	And he was going in and going out among them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. 
ACT.9.29	And he was speaking and debating with the Greek-speaking Jews,
ACT.9.30	And when
ACT.9.31	Then the church throughout all of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being strengthened. And living in the fear of the Lord and the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, it was increasing in numbers.
ACT.9.32	Now it happened that as
ACT.9.33	And he found there a certain man named
ACT.9.34	And Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you! Get up and make your bed yourself!” And immediately he got up. 
ACT.9.35	And all those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him, who all
ACT.9.36	Now in Joppa there was a certain female disciple named
ACT.9.37	Now it happened that in those days after
ACT.9.38	And because
ACT.9.39	So Peter got up and
ACT.9.40	But Peter sent them all outside, and, falling to his
ACT.9.41	And he gave her his hand and
ACT.9.42	And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. 
ACT.9.43	And it happened that he stayed many days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.
ACT.10.1	 Now there was a certain man in Caesarea named
ACT.10.2	devout and fearing God together with all his household, doing many charitable deeds for the people and praying to God continually.
ACT.10.3	About the ninth hour of the day, he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, “Cornelius.” 
ACT.10.4	And he stared at him and became terrified and
ACT.10.5	And now, send men to Joppa and summon a certain Simon, who is also called Peter. 
ACT.10.6	This man is staying as a guest with a certain Simon, a tanner,
ACT.10.7	And when the angel who spoke to him departed, he summoned two of the household slaves and a devout soldier from those who attended him, 
ACT.10.8	and after he
ACT.10.9	And the next day, as
ACT.10.10	And he became hungry and wanted to eat. But while
ACT.10.11	And he saw heaven opened and an object something like a large sheet coming down, being let down to the earth by its four corners, 
ACT.10.12	in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of the sky. 
ACT.10.13	And a voice came to him, “Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!” 
ACT.10.14	But Peter said, “Certainly not, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common and unclean!” 
ACT.10.15	And the voice came again to him for the second time: “The things which God has made clean, you must not consider unclean!” 
ACT.10.16	And this happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into heaven. 
ACT.10.17	Now while Peter was greatly perplexed within himself as to what the vision that he had seen might be, behold, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having found the house of Simon by asking around, stood at the gate. 
ACT.10.18	And they called out and
ACT.10.19	And while
ACT.10.20	But get up, go down, and go with them—not hesitating at all, because I have sent them.” 
ACT.10.21	So Peter went down to the men and
ACT.10.22	And they said, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man—and well spoken of by the whole nation of the Jews—was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear words from you.” 
ACT.10.23	So he invited them in and
ACT.10.24	And on the next day he entered into Caesarea. 
ACT.10.24	Now Cornelius was waiting for them, and
ACT.10.25	So it happened that when Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell at his
ACT.10.26	But Peter helped him up, saying, “Get up! I myself am also a man!” 
ACT.10.27	And as he
ACT.10.28	And he said to them, “You know that it is forbidden for a Jewish man to associate with or to approach a foreigner. And to me God has shown that I should call no man common or unclean. 
ACT.10.29	Therefore—and without raising any objection—I came when I
ACT.10.30	And Cornelius said, “Four days ago at this hour,
ACT.10.31	and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your charitable deeds have been remembered before God. 
ACT.10.32	Therefore send to Joppa and summon Simon who is also called Peter. This man is staying as a guest in the house of Simon, a tanner,
ACT.10.33	Therefore I sent for you at once, and you were kind enough to come.
ACT.10.34	So Peter opened his
ACT.10.35	but in every nation the one who fears him and who does what is right is acceptable to him. 
ACT.10.36	As for
ACT.10.37	you know the thing that happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism that John proclaimed: 
ACT.10.38	Jesus of Nazareth—how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him. 
ACT.10.39	And we are witnesses of all the things that he did both in the land of the Judeans and in Jerusalem, whom they also executed by
ACT.10.40	God raised this one up on the third day and granted that he should become visible, 
ACT.10.41	not to all the people but to us who had been chosen beforehand by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. 
ACT.10.42	And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify solemnly that this one is the one appointed
ACT.10.43	To this one all the prophets testify, that through his name everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins.” 
ACT.10.44	While
ACT.10.45	And those believers from the circumcision who had accompanied Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles, 
ACT.10.46	for they heard them speaking in tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter said, 
ACT.10.47	“Surely no one can withhold the water for these people to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also did!” 
ACT.10.48	So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for several days. 
ACT.11.1	 Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had accepted the word
ACT.11.2	So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision took issue with him, 
ACT.11.3	saying, “You went to men who were uncircumcised
ACT.11.4	But Peter began and
ACT.11.5	“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision—an object something like a large sheet coming down, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came to me. 
ACT.11.6	As I
ACT.11.7	And I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!’ 
ACT.11.8	But I said, ‘Certainly not, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has ever entered into my mouth!’ 
ACT.11.9	But the voice replied from heaven for the second time, ‘The things which God has made clean, you must not consider unclean!’ 
ACT.11.10	And this happened three times, and everything was pulled up into heaven again. 
ACT.11.11	And behold, at once three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea approached the house in which we were staying.
ACT.11.12	And the Spirit told me to accompany them, not hesitating at all. So these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the man’s house. 
ACT.11.13	And he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is also called Peter, 
ACT.11.14	who will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.’ 
ACT.11.15	And as I was beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as also on us at the beginning. 
ACT.11.16	And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’
ACT.11.17	Therefore if God gave them the same gift as also to us when we
ACT.11.18	And when they
ACT.11.19	Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, proclaiming the message to no one except Jews alone. 
ACT.11.20	But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they
ACT.11.21	And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord. 
ACT.11.22	And the report came to the attention
ACT.11.23	who, when he
ACT.11.24	because he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a large number were added
ACT.11.25	So he departed for Tarsus to look for Saul. 
ACT.11.26	And when he
ACT.11.27	Now in those days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
ACT.11.28	And one of them named
ACT.11.29	So from the disciples, according to their ability to give,
ACT.11.30	which they also did, sending the aid
ACT.12.1	 Now at that time, Herod the king laid hands on some of those from the church to harm them.
ACT.12.2	So he executed James the brother of John with a sword. 
ACT.12.3	And when he
ACT.12.4	After he
ACT.12.5	Thus Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer was fervently being made to God by the church for him. 
ACT.12.6	Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards before the door were watching the prison. 
ACT.12.7	And behold, an angel of the Lord stood near him,
ACT.12.8	And the angel said to him, “Gird yourself and put on your sandals!” And he did so. And he said to him, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me!” 
ACT.12.9	And he went out and
ACT.12.10	And after they
ACT.12.11	And when
ACT.12.12	And when he
ACT.12.13	And when
ACT.12.14	And recognizing Peter’s voice, because of her
ACT.12.15	But they said to her, “You are out of your mind!” But she kept insisting
ACT.12.16	But Peter was continuing to knock, and when they
ACT.12.17	But motioning to them with his
ACT.12.18	Now when
ACT.12.19	And when
ACT.12.20	Now he was very angry with the Tyrians and Sidonians. So they came to him with one purpose, and after
ACT.12.21	So on an appointed day Herod, after
ACT.12.22	But the people began to call out loudly,
ACT.12.23	And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down because
ACT.12.24	But the word of God kept on increasing
ACT.12.25	So Barnabas and Saul returned to
ACT.13.1	 Now there were prophets and teachers in Antioch in the church that was there: Barnabas, and Simeon (who was called Niger), and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen (a close friend of Herod the tetrarch), and Saul. 
ACT.13.2	And while
ACT.13.3	Then, after they
ACT.13.4	Therefore, sent out by the Holy Spirit, they came down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed away to Cyprus. 
ACT.13.5	And when they
ACT.13.6	And when they
ACT.13.7	who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and
ACT.13.8	But Elymas the magician (for his name is translated in this way) opposed them, attempting to turn the proconsul away from the faith. 
ACT.13.9	But Saul (also called Paul), filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him 
ACT.13.10	and
ACT.13.11	And now behold, the hand of the Lord is against you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a while.
ACT.13.12	Then when
ACT.13.13	Now Paul and his companions
ACT.13.14	And they went on from Perga and
ACT.13.15	So after the reading from the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent word
ACT.13.16	So Paul stood up,
ACT.13.17	The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people during their
ACT.13.18	And for a period of time of about forty years, he put up with them in the wilderness. 
ACT.13.19	And after
ACT.13.20	This took
ACT.13.21	And then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man from the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. 
ACT.13.22	And after
ACT.13.23	From the descendants of this man, according to his promise, God brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus. 
ACT.13.24	Before his coming
ACT.13.25	But while John was completing his
ACT.13.26	“Men and brothers, sons of the family of Abraham and those among you who fear God—to us the message of this salvation has been sent! 
ACT.13.27	For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they
ACT.13.28	And although they
ACT.13.29	And when they had carried out all the things that were written about him, they took him
ACT.13.30	But God raised him from the dead, 
ACT.13.31	who appeared for many days to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem—who are now his witnesses to the people. 
ACT.13.32	And we proclaim the good news to you: that the promise that was made to the fathers, 
ACT.13.33	this promise
ACT.13.33	‘You are my Son; 
ACT.13.33	today I have fathered you.’
ACT.13.34	But that he has raised him from the dead, no more going to return to decay, he has spoken in this way: ‘I will give you the reliable divine decrees of David.’
ACT.13.35	Therefore he also says in another psalm,
ACT.13.35	‘You will not permit your Holy One to experience decay.’
ACT.13.36	For David, after
ACT.13.37	But he whom God raised up did not experience decay. 
ACT.13.38	“Therefore let it be known to you, men and brothers, that through this one forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, 
ACT.13.39	by this one everyone who believes is justified! 
ACT.13.40	Watch out, therefore, lest what is stated by the prophets come upon you:
ACT.13.41	‘Look, you scoffers, 
ACT.13.41	and be astonished and perish! 
ACT.13.41	For I am doing a work in your days, 
ACT.13.41	a work that you would never believe 
ACT.13.41	even if someone were to tell it
ACT.13.42	And as
ACT.13.43	And after
ACT.13.44	And on the coming Sabbath, nearly the whole city came together to hear the word of the Lord. 
ACT.13.45	But when
ACT.13.46	Both Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly and
ACT.13.47	For so the Lord has commanded us: 
ACT.13.47	‘I have appointed you to be
ACT.13.47	that you would bring
ACT.13.48	And when
ACT.13.49	So the word of the Lord was carried through the whole region. 
ACT.13.50	But the Jews incited the devout women of high social standing and the most prominent men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them out of their district. 
ACT.13.51	So after
ACT.13.52	And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.14.1	 Now it happened that in Iconium they entered together
ACT.14.2	But the Jews who were disobedient stirred up and poisoned the minds
ACT.14.3	So they stayed there
ACT.14.4	But the population of the city was divided, and some
ACT.14.5	So when an inclination took place on the part of both the Gentiles and the Jews, together with their rulers, to mistreat them
ACT.14.6	they became aware of it
ACT.14.7	And there they were continuing to proclaim the good news. 
ACT.14.8	And in Lystra a certain man was sitting powerless in his feet, lame from birth,
ACT.14.9	This man listened while
ACT.14.10	said with a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet!” And he leaped up and began walking.
ACT.14.11	And when
ACT.14.12	And they began calling
ACT.14.13	And the priest of the temple
ACT.14.14	But when
ACT.14.15	and saying, “Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men with the same nature as you, proclaiming the good news that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things that are in them—
ACT.14.16	who in generations that are past permitted all the nations
ACT.14.17	And yet he did not leave himself without witness by
ACT.14.18	And although
ACT.14.19	But Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium, and when they
ACT.14.20	But after
ACT.14.21	And after they
ACT.14.22	strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them
ACT.14.23	And when they
ACT.14.24	And they passed through Pisidia and
ACT.14.25	And after
ACT.14.26	and from there they sailed away to Antioch where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had completed. 
ACT.14.27	And when they
ACT.14.28	And they stayed no little time with the disciples. 
ACT.15.1	 And some men came down from Judea and
ACT.15.2	And after
ACT.15.3	So they were sent on their way by the church, and
ACT.15.4	And when they
ACT.15.5	But some of those who had believed from the party of the Pharisees stood up, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them
ACT.15.6	Both the apostles and the elders assembled to deliberate concerning this matter. 
ACT.15.7	And after
ACT.15.8	And God, who knows the heart, testified to them by
ACT.15.9	And he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. 
ACT.15.10	So now why are you putting God to the test by
ACT.15.11	But we believe we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus in the same
ACT.15.12	And the whole group became silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul describing all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. 
ACT.15.13	And after they had stopped speaking, James answered, saying, “Men and brothers, listen to me! 
ACT.15.14	Simeon has described how God first concerned himself to take from among the Gentiles a people for his name. 
ACT.15.15	And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written: 
ACT.15.16	‘After these things I will return 
ACT.15.16	and build up again the tent of David that has fallen, 
ACT.15.16	and the parts of it that had been torn down I will build up again 
ACT.15.16	and will restore it, 
ACT.15.17	so that the rest of humanity may seek the Lord, 
ACT.15.17	even all the Gentiles
ACT.15.17	says the Lord,
ACT.15.18	known from of old.’
ACT.15.19	Therefore I conclude we should not cause difficulty for those from among the Gentiles who turn to God, 
ACT.15.20	but we should write a letter to them to abstain from the pollution of idols and from sexual immorality and from what has been strangled and from blood. 
ACT.15.21	For Moses has those who proclaim him in every city from ancient generations, because he
ACT.15.22	Then it seemed best to the apostles and the elders, together with the whole church, to send men chosen from among them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas—Judas who was called Barsabbas and Silas, men who were leaders among the brothers—
ACT.15.23	writing this letter
ACT.15.23	The apostles and the elders, brothers. 
ACT.15.23	To the brothers who are from among the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia. 
ACT.15.23	Greetings! 
ACT.15.24	Because we have heard that some have gone out from among us—to whom we gave no orders—and
ACT.15.25	it seemed best to us, having reached a unanimous decision,
ACT.15.26	men who have risked their lives on behalf of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ACT.15.27	Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, and they will report the same things by word of mouth. 
ACT.15.28	For it seemed best to the Holy Spirit and to us to place on you no greater burden except these necessary things: 
ACT.15.29	that you abstain from food sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you
ACT.15.29	Farewell. 
ACT.15.30	So when
ACT.15.31	And when they
ACT.15.32	Both Judas and Silas, who were also prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brothers by a long message. 
ACT.15.33	And after
ACT.15.35	But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord with many others also. 
ACT.15.36	And after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, “Come then,let us return and
ACT.15.37	Now Barnabas wanted to take John who was called Mark along also, 
ACT.15.38	but Paul held the opinion they should not take this one along, who departed from them in Pamphylia and did not accompany them in the work. 
ACT.15.39	And a sharp disagreement took place, so that they separated from one another. And Barnabas took along Mark and
ACT.15.40	but Paul chose Silas and
ACT.15.41	And he traveled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches. 
ACT.16.1	 And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple was there named
ACT.16.2	who was well spoken of by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium. 
ACT.16.3	Paul wanted this one to go with him, and he took him
ACT.16.4	And as they went through the towns, they passed on to them to observe the rules that had been decided by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem. 
ACT.16.5	So the churches were being strengthened in the faith and were growing in number every day. 
ACT.16.6	And they traveled through the Phrygian and Galatian region, having been prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the message in Asia.
ACT.16.7	And when they
ACT.16.8	So going through Mysia, they went down to Troas. 
ACT.16.9	And a vision appeared to Paul during the night: a certain Macedonian man was standing there and imploring him and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and
ACT.16.10	And when he had seen the vision, we wanted at once to go away to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to proclaim the good news to them. 
ACT.16.11	So putting out to sea from Troas, we sailed a straight course to Samothrace, and on the following day to Neapolis, 
ACT.16.12	and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of that district of Macedonia, a Roman colony. And we were staying in this city for some days. 
ACT.16.13	And on the day of the Sabbath, we went outside the city gate beside the river, where we thought there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and
ACT.16.14	And a certain woman named
ACT.16.15	And after she was baptized, and her household, she urged us,
ACT.16.16	And it happened that as
ACT.16.17	She followed Paul and us and
ACT.16.18	And she was doing this for many days. But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed and turning around, said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out immediately.
ACT.16.19	But when
ACT.16.20	And when they
ACT.16.21	and are proclaiming customs that are not permitted for us to accept or to practice, because we
ACT.16.22	And the crowd joined in attacking them, and the chief magistrates tore off their clothing and
ACT.16.23	And after they
ACT.16.24	Having received such an order, he
ACT.16.25	Now about midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and
ACT.16.26	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened and all the bonds
ACT.16.27	And after
ACT.16.28	But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, “Do no harm to yourself, for we are all here!” 
ACT.16.29	And demanding lights, he rushed in and, beginning to tremble,
ACT.16.30	And he brought them outside and
ACT.16.31	And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household!” 
ACT.16.32	And they spoke the message of the Lord to him, together with all those in his house. 
ACT.16.33	And he took them at that very hour of the night and
ACT.16.34	And he brought them up into his
ACT.16.35	And when it
ACT.16.36	And the jailer reported these words to Paul: “The chief magistrates have sent an order
ACT.16.37	But Paul said to them, “They beat us in public without due process—men who are Roman citizens—and
ACT.16.38	So the police officers reported these words to the chief magistrates, and they were afraid when they
ACT.16.39	And they came and
ACT.16.40	And when they
ACT.17.1	 Now after they
ACT.17.2	And as was his custom,
ACT.17.3	explaining and demonstrating that it was necessary for the Christ
ACT.17.4	And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, and also a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few of the prominent women. 
ACT.17.5	But the Jews were filled with jealousy and, taking along some worthless men from the rabble in the marketplace and forming a mob, threw the city into an uproar. And attacking Jason’s house, they were looking for them to bring them
ACT.17.6	And when they
ACT.17.7	whom Jason has entertained as guests! And these people are all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, Jesus!” 
ACT.17.8	And they threw the crowd into confusion, and the city officials who heard these things. 
ACT.17.9	And after
ACT.17.10	Now the brothers sent away both Paul and Silas at once, during the night, to Berea. They
ACT.17.11	Now these were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica. They
ACT.17.12	Therefore many of them believed, and not a few of the prominent Greek women and men. 
ACT.17.13	But when the Jews from Thessalonica found out that the message of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there too, inciting and stirring up the crowds. 
ACT.17.14	So then the brothers sent Paul away at once to go to the sea, and both Silas and Timothy remained there. 
ACT.17.15	And those who conducted Paul brought him
ACT.17.16	Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he
ACT.17.17	So he was discussing in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles,
ACT.17.18	And even some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him, and some were saying, “What does this babbler want to say?” But others said,
ACT.17.19	And they took hold of him and
ACT.17.20	For you are bringing some astonishing things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.”
ACT.17.21	(Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who stayed there used to spend their time in nothing else than telling something or listening to something new.) 
ACT.17.22	So Paul stood there in the middle of the Areopagus and
ACT.17.23	For as I
ACT.17.24	the God who made the world and all the things in it. This one, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by human hands, 
ACT.17.25	nor is he served by human hands as if he
ACT.17.26	And he made from one man every nation of humanity to live on all the face of the earth, determining their fixed times and the fixed boundaries of their habitation, 
ACT.17.27	to search for God, if perhaps indeed they might feel around for him and find him.
ACT.17.28	for in him we live and move and exist,
ACT.17.29	Therefore, because we
ACT.17.30	Therefore although
ACT.17.31	because he has set a day on which he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the man who he has appointed, having provided proof to everyone by
ACT.17.32	Now when they
ACT.17.33	So Paul went out from the midst of them. 
ACT.17.34	But some people
ACT.18.1	 After these things he departed from Athens and
ACT.18.2	And he found a certain Jew named
ACT.18.3	And because he was practicing the same trade, he stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade. 
ACT.18.4	And he argued in the synagogue every Sabbath, attempting to persuade
ACT.18.5	Now when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul began to be occupied with
ACT.18.6	And when
ACT.18.7	And leaving there, he entered into the house of someone named
ACT.18.8	And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord together with his whole household. And many of the Corinthians, when they
ACT.18.9	And the Lord said to Paul by a vision in the night, “Do not be afraid, but speak and do not keep silent, 
ACT.18.10	because I am with you and no one will attack you to harm you, because many people are mine in this city.” 
ACT.18.11	So he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. 
ACT.18.12	Now when
ACT.18.13	saying, “This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law!” 
ACT.18.14	But when
ACT.18.15	But if it is questions concerning a word and names and your own law,
ACT.18.16	And he drove them away from the judgment seat. 
ACT.18.17	So they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and
ACT.18.18	So Paul, after
ACT.18.19	So they arrived at Ephesus, and those he left behind there, but he himself entered into the synagogue and
ACT.18.20	And when
ACT.18.21	but saying farewell and telling them,
ACT.18.22	And when he
ACT.18.23	And after
ACT.18.24	Now a certain Jew named
ACT.18.25	This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and being enthusiastic in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things about Jesus, although he
ACT.18.26	And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when
ACT.18.27	And when
ACT.18.28	For he was vigorously refuting the Jews in public, demonstrating through the scriptures that the Christ
ACT.19.1	 And it happened that while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the inland regions and
ACT.19.2	And he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you
ACT.19.3	And he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” And they said, “Into the baptism of John.” 
ACT.19.4	And Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people that they should believe in the one who was to come after him—that is, in Jesus.” 
ACT.19.5	And when they
ACT.19.6	And when
ACT.19.7	(Now the total number of men was about twelve.) 
ACT.19.8	So he entered into the synagogue and
ACT.19.9	But when some became hardened and were disobedient, reviling the Way before the congregation, he departed from them and
ACT.19.10	And this took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia
ACT.19.11	And God was performing extraordinary
ACT.19.12	so that even handkerchiefs or work aprons that had touched his skin
ACT.19.13	But some itinerant Jewish exorcists also attempted to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches!” 
ACT.19.14	(Now seven sons of a certain Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.) 
ACT.19.15	But the evil spirit answered and
ACT.19.16	And the man who had the evil spirit
ACT.19.17	And this became known to all who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was exalted. 
ACT.19.18	And many of those who had believed came, confessing and disclosing their practices, 
ACT.19.19	and many of those who practiced magic brought together their
ACT.19.20	In this way the word of the Lord was growing in power and was prevailing. 
ACT.19.21	Now when these things were completed, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, “After I have been there, it is necessary for me to see Rome also.” 
ACT.19.22	So after
ACT.19.23	Now there happened at that time no little disturbance concerning the Way. 
ACT.19.24	For someone named
ACT.19.25	These
ACT.19.26	and you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia
ACT.19.27	So not only is there a danger this line of business of ours will come into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be regarded as nothing—and she is about to be brought down even from her grandeur, she whom the whole of Asia
ACT.19.28	And when they
ACT.19.29	And the city was filled with the tumult, and with one purpose they rushed into the theater, seizing Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were traveling companions of Paul. 
ACT.19.30	But when
ACT.19.31	And even some of the Asiarchs
ACT.19.32	So some were shouting one thing
ACT.19.33	And some of the crowd advised
ACT.19.34	But when they
ACT.19.35	And when
ACT.19.36	Therefore because
ACT.19.37	For you have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess. 
ACT.19.38	If then Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against anyone, the court days are observed and there are proconsuls—let them bring charges against one another! 
ACT.19.39	But if you desire anything further, it will be settled in the lawful assembly. 
ACT.19.40	For indeed we are in danger of being accused of rioting concerning today, since there
ACT.20.1	 Now after the turmoil had ceased, Paul summoned
ACT.20.2	And after he
ACT.20.3	and stayed
ACT.20.4	And Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, and Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, and Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia, were accompanying him. 
ACT.20.5	And these had gone on ahead and
ACT.20.6	And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread and came to them at Troas within five days, where we stayed seven days. 
ACT.20.7	And on the first day of the week, when
ACT.20.8	Now there were quite a few lamps in the upstairs room where we were gathered. 
ACT.20.9	And a certain young man named
ACT.20.10	But Paul went down and
ACT.20.11	So he went up and broke bread,
ACT.20.12	And they led the youth away alive, and were greatly
ACT.20.13	But we went on ahead to the ship and
ACT.20.14	And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and
ACT.20.15	And we sailed from there on the next day, and
ACT.20.16	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he would not be having to spend time in Asia.
ACT.20.17	And from Miletus he sent word
ACT.20.18	And when they came to him, he said to them, “You know from the first day on which I set foot in Asia
ACT.20.19	serving the Lord with all humility and with tears, and with the trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews—
ACT.20.20	how I did not shrink from proclaiming to you anything that would be profitable, and from teaching you in public and from house to house, 
ACT.20.21	testifying both to Jews and to Greeks with respect to repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus. 
ACT.20.22	“And now behold, bound by the Spirit I am traveling to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there,
ACT.20.23	except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in town after town, saying that bonds and persecutions await me. 
ACT.20.24	But I consider my
ACT.20.25	“And now behold, I know that all of you, among whom I went about proclaiming the kingdom, will see my face no more. 
ACT.20.26	Therefore I testify to you on this very day that I am guiltless of the blood of all of you,
ACT.20.27	for I did not shrink from proclaiming to you the whole purpose of God. 
ACT.20.28	Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock among which the Holy Spirit has appointed you as overseers, to shepherd the church of God which he obtained through the blood of his own Son.
ACT.20.29	I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. 
ACT.20.30	And from among you yourselves men will arise, speaking perversions of the truth
ACT.20.31	Therefore be on the alert, remembering that night and day for three years I did not stop warning each one of you
ACT.20.32	“And now I entrust you to God and to the message of his grace, which is able to build you
ACT.20.33	I have desired no one’s silver or gold or clothing! 
ACT.20.34	You yourselves know that these hands served to meet
ACT.20.35	I have shown you with respect to all things that by
ACT.20.36	And when he
ACT.20.37	And there was considerable weeping by all, and hugging
ACT.20.38	especially distressed at the statement that he had said, that they were going to see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship. 
ACT.21.1	 And it happened that after we tore ourselves away
ACT.21.2	And finding a ship that was crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and
ACT.21.3	And after we
ACT.21.4	And we stayed there seven days after we
ACT.21.5	And it happened that when our days were over, we departed and
ACT.21.6	we said farewell to one another and embarked in the ship, and they returned to their own homes. 
ACT.21.7	And when
ACT.21.8	And on the next day we departed and
ACT.21.9	(Now this man had
ACT.21.10	And while we
ACT.21.11	And he came to us and took Paul’s belt. Tying up his own feet and hands, he said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says: ‘In this way the Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man whose belt this is, and will deliver him
ACT.21.12	And when we heard these things, both we and the local residents urged him not to go up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.13	Then Paul replied, “What are you doing weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be tied up, but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus!” 
ACT.21.14	And because
ACT.21.15	So after these days we got ready and
ACT.21.16	And some of the disciples from Caesarea also traveled together with us, bringing us
ACT.21.17	And when
ACT.21.18	And on the next day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. 
ACT.21.19	And after
ACT.21.20	And when
ACT.21.21	And they have been informed about you that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles the abandonment of Moses, telling them not to circumcise their
ACT.21.22	What then is to be done?
ACT.21.23	Therefore do this that we tell you: we have
ACT.21.24	Take these men and
ACT.21.25	But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we have written a letter after
ACT.21.26	Then Paul took along the men on the next day, and
ACT.21.27	But when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia
ACT.21.28	shouting, “Israelite men, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place! And furthermore he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place!” 
ACT.21.29	(For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they thought that Paul had brought into the temple.) 
ACT.21.30	And the whole city was stirred up, and the people came running together, and they seized Paul and
ACT.21.31	And as they
ACT.21.32	He
ACT.21.33	Then the military tribune came up and
ACT.21.34	But some in the crowd were shouting one thing and others another, and because
ACT.21.35	And when he came to the steps, it happened that he had to be carried by the soldiers on account of the violence of the crowd, 
ACT.21.36	for the crowd of people was following them,
ACT.21.37	And as he
ACT.21.38	Then you are not the Egyptian who before these days raised a revolt and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?”
ACT.21.39	But Paul said, “I am a Jewish man from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no unimportant city. Now I ask you, allow me to speak to the people.” 
ACT.21.40	So when
ACT.22.1	 “Men—brothers and fathers—listen to my defense to you now!” 
ACT.22.2	And when they
ACT.22.3	“I am a Jewish man born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, educated according to the exactness of the law received from our fathers, being zealous for God, just as all of you are today. 
ACT.22.4	I
ACT.22.5	as indeed the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me, from whom also I received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and
ACT.22.6	“And it happened that as
ACT.22.7	and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’ 
ACT.22.8	And I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me, ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene whom you are persecuting.’ 
ACT.22.9	(Now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me.) 
ACT.22.10	So I said, ‘What should I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, ‘Get up and
ACT.22.11	And as I could not see as a result of the brightness of that light, I arrived in Damascus led by the hand of those who were with me. 
ACT.22.12	And a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who live there, 
ACT.22.13	came to me and stood by me
ACT.22.14	And he said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth, 
ACT.22.15	because you will be a witness for him
ACT.22.16	And now why are you delaying? Get up, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name!’ 
ACT.22.17	“And it happened that when
ACT.22.18	and saw him saying to me, ‘Hurry and depart quickly
ACT.22.19	And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that from synagogue to synagogue I was imprisoning and beating those who believed in you. 
ACT.22.20	And when the blood of your witness Stephen was being shed, I myself also was standing near and was approving, and was guarding the cloaks of those who were killing him.’ 
ACT.22.21	And he said to me, ‘Go, because I will send you far away to the Gentiles!’ ” 
ACT.22.22	Now they were listening to him until this word, and they raised their voices, saying, “Away with such a man from the earth! For it is not fitting for him to live!” 
ACT.22.23	And while
ACT.22.24	the military tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks,
ACT.22.25	But when they had stretched him out for the lash,
ACT.22.26	And when
ACT.22.27	So the military tribune came and
ACT.22.28	And the military tribune replied, “I acquired this citizenship for a large sum of money.” And Paul said, “But I indeed was born a citizen.
ACT.22.29	Then immediately those who were about to examine him kept away from him, and the military tribune also was afraid when he
ACT.22.30	But on the next day, because he
ACT.23.1	 And looking intently at the Sanhedrin, Paul said, “Men and brothers, I have lived my life in all good conscience before God to this day.” 
ACT.23.2	So the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near him to strike his mouth. 
ACT.23.3	Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! And are you sitting there judging me according to the law, and acting contrary to the law do you order me to be struck?” 
ACT.23.4	And those who stood nearby said, “Are you reviling the high priest of God?” 
ACT.23.5	And Paul said, “I did not know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, ‘You must not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’ ”
ACT.23.6	Now when
ACT.23.7	And when
ACT.23.8	(For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection or angel or spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.) 
ACT.23.9	And there was loud shouting, and some of the scribes from the party of the Pharisees stood up and
ACT.23.10	And when
ACT.23.11	And the next night the Lord stood by him and
ACT.23.12	And when it
ACT.23.13	Now there were more than forty who had made this conspiracy, 
ACT.23.14	who went to the chief priests and the elders and
ACT.23.15	Therefore, now you along with the Sanhedrin explain to the military tribune that he should bring him down to you, as if you were going to determine more accurately the things concerning him. And we are ready to do away with him before he comes near.” 
ACT.23.16	But when
ACT.23.17	So Paul called one of the centurions and
ACT.23.18	So he took him and
ACT.23.19	And the military tribune, taking hold of his hand and withdrawing privately, asked, “What is it that you have to report to me?” 
ACT.23.20	And he said, “The Jews have agreed to ask you that you bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin tomorrow, as if they were going to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him. 
ACT.23.21	You therefore do not be persuaded by them, because more than forty men of their number
ACT.23.22	So the military tribune sent the young man away, directing him,
ACT.23.23	And he summoned two of the centurions and
ACT.23.24	And provide mounts so that they can put Paul on them and
ACT.23.25	He wrote
ACT.23.26	Claudius Lysias. 
ACT.23.26	To his excellency Governor Felix. 
ACT.23.26	Greetings! 
ACT.23.27	This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I
ACT.23.28	And because I
ACT.23.29	I found he
ACT.23.30	And when it
ACT.23.31	Therefore the soldiers, in accordance with their orders,
ACT.23.32	And on the next day they let the horsemen go on with him, and
ACT.23.33	The horsemen,
ACT.23.34	So after
ACT.23.35	he said, “I will give you a hearing whenever your accusers arrive also,” giving orders for him to be guarded in the praetorium
ACT.24.1	 And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and an attorney, a certain Tertullus, all of whom brought charges against Paul to the governor. 
ACT.24.2	And when
ACT.24.3	Both in every way and everywhere we acknowledge this,
ACT.24.4	But so that I may not impose on you for longer, I implore you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness. 
ACT.24.5	For we have found
ACT.24.6	who even attempted to desecrate the temple, and we arrested him
ACT.24.8	When
ACT.24.9	And the Jews also joined in the attack, asserting these things were so. 
ACT.24.10	And when
ACT.24.11	You can ascertain that it has not been more than
ACT.24.12	And neither did they find me arguing with anyone or making a crowd develop in the temple courts
ACT.24.13	Nor can they prove the things
ACT.24.14	But I do confess this to you, that according to the Way (which they call a sect), so I worship the God of our fathers, believing all things that are in accordance with the law and that are written in the prophets, 
ACT.24.15	having a hope in God which these men also themselves await: that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. 
ACT.24.16	For this reason
ACT.24.17	So after many years, I came to practice charitable giving and offerings to my people,
ACT.24.18	in which they found me purified in the temple courts,
ACT.24.19	But there are some Jews from Asia
ACT.24.20	or these men themselves should say what crime they found when
ACT.24.21	other than concerning this one declaration that I shouted while
ACT.24.22	But Felix, because he
ACT.24.23	He ordered
ACT.24.24	And after some days, when
ACT.24.25	And while
ACT.24.26	At the same time he was also hoping that money would be given to him by Paul. For this reason also he sent for him as often as possible and
ACT.24.27	And when
ACT.25.1	 Now when
ACT.25.2	And the chief priests and the most prominent men of the Jews brought charges against Paul to him, and were urging him, 
ACT.25.3	asking for a favor against him, that he summon him to Jerusalem, because they
ACT.25.4	Then Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and he himself was about to go there
ACT.25.5	So he said, “Let those among you who are prominent go down with me,
ACT.25.6	And after he
ACT.25.7	And when
ACT.25.8	while
ACT.25.9	But Festus, because he
ACT.25.10	But Paul said, “I am standing before the judgment seat of Caesar, where it is necessary for me to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well. 
ACT.25.11	If then I am doing wrong
ACT.25.12	Then Festus, after
ACT.25.13	Now after
ACT.25.14	And while they were staying there many days, Festus laid out the case against Paul to the king, saying, “There is a certain man left behind by Felix as a prisoner, 
ACT.25.15	concerning whom when
ACT.25.16	To them
ACT.25.17	Therefore, when
ACT.25.18	When they
ACT.25.19	but they had some issues with him concerning their own religion, and concerning a certain Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul claimed to be alive. 
ACT.25.20	And because
ACT.25.21	But when
ACT.25.22	So Agrippa said to Festus, “I want to hear the man myself also.” “Tomorrow,” he said, “you will hear him.” 
ACT.25.23	So on the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came with great pageantry and entered into the audience hall, along with military tribunes and the most prominent men of the city. And when
ACT.25.24	And Festus said, “King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole population of the Jews appealed to me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he must not live any longer. 
ACT.25.25	But I understood that he had done nothing deserving death himself, and when
ACT.25.26	I do not have anything definite to write to my
ACT.25.27	For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner and not to indicate the charges against him.” 
ACT.26.1	 So Agrippa said to Paul, “It is permitted for you to speak for yourself.” Then Paul extended his
ACT.26.2	“Concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that before you I am about to defend myself today, 
ACT.26.3	because
ACT.26.4	“Now all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth, that had taken place from the beginning among my own people
ACT.26.5	having known me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that in accordance with the strictest party of our religion I lived as a Pharisee. 
ACT.26.6	And now I stand here on trial on the basis of hope in the promise made by God to our fathers, 
ACT.26.7	to which our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly serve him
ACT.26.8	Why is it thought incredible by you people
ACT.26.9	Indeed, I myself thought it was necessary to do many things opposed to the name of Jesus the Nazarene, 
ACT.26.10	which I also did in Jerusalem, and not only did I lock up many of the saints in prison, having received authority from the chief priests, but also when
ACT.26.11	And throughout all the synagogues I punished them often and
ACT.26.12	In this activity
ACT.26.13	In the middle of the day along the road, O king, I saw a light from heaven, more than the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who were traveling with me. 
ACT.26.14	And when
ACT.26.15	So I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. 
ACT.26.16	But get up and stand on your feet, because for this reason I have appeared to you, to appoint you a servant and witness both to the things in which you saw me and to the things in which I will appear to you, 
ACT.26.17	rescuing you from the people and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you, 
ACT.26.18	to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’ 
ACT.26.19	“Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, 
ACT.26.20	but to those in Damascus first, and in Jerusalem and all the region of Judea and to the Gentiles, I proclaimed that they should repent and turn to God, doing deeds worthy of repentance. 
ACT.26.21	On account of these things the Jews seized me in
ACT.26.22	Therefore I have experienced help from God until this day, and
ACT.26.23	that the Christ
ACT.26.24	And as
ACT.26.25	But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but am speaking words of truth and rationality. 
ACT.26.26	For the king knows about these things, to whom also I am speaking freely, for I am not convinced that these things in any way have escaped
ACT.26.27	Do you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you believe.” 
ACT.26.28	But Agrippa said to Paul, “In a short time are you persuading me to become a Christian?”
ACT.26.29	And Paul replied, “I pray to God, whether in a short time or in a long time, not only you but also all those who are listening to me today may become such people as I also am, except for these bonds!” 
ACT.26.30	Both the king and the governor got up, and Bernice and those who were sitting with them. 
ACT.26.31	And as they
ACT.26.32	And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.” 
ACT.27.1	 And when it was decided that we would sail away to Italy, they handed over Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named
ACT.27.2	And we went aboard a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to the places along the coast
ACT.27.3	And on the next day, we put in at Sidon. And Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed him
ACT.27.4	And from there we put out to sea and
ACT.27.5	And after we
ACT.27.6	And there the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and
ACT.27.7	And sailing slowly, in many days and with difficulty we came
ACT.27.8	And sailing along its coast with difficulty, we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near which was the town of Lasea. 
ACT.27.9	And because
ACT.27.10	saying to them, “Men, I perceive that the voyage is going to end
ACT.27.11	But the centurion was convinced even more by the shipmaster and the shipowner than by what was said by Paul. 
ACT.27.12	And because
ACT.27.13	And when
ACT.27.14	But not long afterward a wind like a hurricane, called the northeaster,
ACT.27.15	And when
ACT.27.16	And running under the lee of a certain small island called Cauda, we were able with difficulty to get the ship’s boat under control. 
ACT.27.17	After
ACT.27.18	And because
ACT.27.19	and on the third day they threw overboard the gear of the ship with their own hands. 
ACT.27.20	But when
ACT.27.21	And because
ACT.27.22	And now I urge you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life from among you, but only of the ship. 
ACT.27.23	For this night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve came to me, 
ACT.27.24	saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul! It is necessary for you to stand before Caesar, and behold, God has graciously granted you all who are sailing with you.’ 
ACT.27.25	Therefore keep up your courage, men, for I believe God that it will be like this—according to the
ACT.27.26	But it is necessary that we run aground on some island.” 
ACT.27.27	And when the fourteenth night had come, as
ACT.27.28	And taking soundings, they found twenty fathoms. So going on a little further and taking soundings again, they found fifteen fathoms. 
ACT.27.29	And because they
ACT.27.30	And when
ACT.27.31	Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain with the ship, you cannot be saved!” 
ACT.27.32	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship’s boat and let it fall away.
ACT.27.33	And until the day was about to come, Paul was urging them all to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day you have waited anxiously, and
ACT.27.34	Therefore I urge you to take some food, for this is necessary for your preservation. For not a hair from your head will be lost.” 
ACT.27.35	And after he
ACT.27.36	So they all were
ACT.27.37	(Now we were in all two hundred seventy six persons on the ship.) 
ACT.27.38	And when they
ACT.27.39	Now when day came, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay having a beach, onto which they decided to run the ship ashore if they could. 
ACT.27.40	And slipping the anchors, they left them
ACT.27.41	But falling into a place of crosscurrents,
ACT.27.42	Now the plan of the soldiers was that they would kill the prisoners lest any escape by
ACT.27.43	but the centurion, because he
ACT.27.44	and then the rest, some of whom floated
ACT.28.1	 And after we
ACT.28.2	And the local inhabitants showed extraordinary
ACT.28.3	And when
ACT.28.4	And when the local people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they began saying
ACT.28.5	He, in turn, shook off the creature into the fire and
ACT.28.6	But they were expecting that he was going to swell up
ACT.28.7	Now in the regions around that place were fields belonging to the chief official of the island, named
ACT.28.8	And it happened that the father of Publius was lying down, afflicted with fever and dysentery. Paul went
ACT.28.9	And after
ACT.28.10	They also honored us with many honors, and when we
ACT.28.11	Now after three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered at the island, an Alexandrian one with the twin gods Castor and Pollux as its insignia.
ACT.28.12	And putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there three days. 
ACT.28.13	From there we got underway
ACT.28.14	where we found brothers, and
ACT.28.15	And from there the brothers, when they
ACT.28.16	And when we entered into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who was guarding him. 
ACT.28.17	Now it happened that after three days, he called together those who were the most prominent of the Jews. And when
ACT.28.18	who, when they
ACT.28.19	But because
ACT.28.20	Therefore for this reason I have requested to see you and to speak with you,
ACT.28.21	And they said to him, “We have received no letters about you from Judea, nor has any of the brothers come and
ACT.28.22	But we would like to hear from you what you think, for concerning this sect it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.” 
ACT.28.23	And when they
ACT.28.24	And some were convinced by
ACT.28.25	So being in disagreement with one another, they began to leave after
ACT.28.26	saying, 
ACT.28.26	‘Go to this people and say, 
ACT.28.26	“You will keep on hearing
ACT.28.26	and you will keep on seeing
ACT.28.27	For the heart of this people has become dull, 
ACT.28.27	and with their
ACT.28.27	and they have shut their eyes, 
ACT.28.27	lest they see with their
ACT.28.27	and hear with their
ACT.28.27	and understand with their
ACT.28.27	and turn, and I would heal them.” ’
ACT.28.28	Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles. They also will listen!”
ACT.28.30	So he stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and welcomed all who came to him, 
ACT.28.31	proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance. 
ROM.1.1	 Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, 
ROM.1.2	which he promised previously through his prophets in the holy scriptures, 
ROM.1.3	concerning his Son, who was born a descendant
ROM.1.4	who was declared Son of God in power according to the Holy Spirit
ROM.1.5	through whom we have received grace and apostleship for the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles
ROM.1.6	among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ. 
ROM.1.7	To all those in Rome who are loved by God, called to be saints. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
ROM.1.8	First, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed in the whole world. 
ROM.1.9	For God, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, is my witness, how constantly I make mention of you, 
ROM.1.10	always asking in my prayers if somehow now at last I may succeed to come to you in the will of God. 
ROM.1.11	For I desire to see you, in order that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, in order to strengthen you, 
ROM.1.12	that is, to be encouraged together with you through our mutual faith
ROM.1.13	Now I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that often I intended to come to you, and was prevented until now, in order that I might have some fruit among you also, just as also among the rest of the Gentiles.
ROM.1.14	I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. 
ROM.1.15	Thus I am eager
ROM.1.16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. 
ROM.1.17	For the righteousness of God is revealed in it from faith to faith, just as it is written, “But the one who is righteous by faith will live.”
ROM.1.18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all impiety and unrighteousness of people, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, 
ROM.1.19	because what can be known about God is evident among
ROM.1.20	For from the creation of the world, his invisible attributes, both his eternal power and deity, are discerned clearly, being understood in the things created, so that they are without excuse. 
ROM.1.21	For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their reasoning, and their senseless hearts were darkened. 
ROM.1.22	Claiming to be wise, they became fools, 
ROM.1.23	and exchanged the glory of the immortal God with the likeness of an image of mortal human beings and birds and quadrupeds and reptiles. 
ROM.1.24	Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to immorality, that their bodies would be dishonored among themselves, 
ROM.1.25	who exchanged the truth of God with a lie, and worshiped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed for eternity. Amen. 
ROM.1.26	Because of this, God gave them over to degrading passions, for their females exchanged the natural relations for those contrary to nature, 
ROM.1.27	and likewise also the males, abandoning the natural relations with the female, were inflamed in their desire toward one another, males with males committing the shameless deed, and receiving in themselves the penalty that was necessary for their error. 
ROM.1.28	And just as they did not see fit to recognize God
ROM.1.29	being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greediness, malice, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malevolence. They are gossipers, 
ROM.1.30	slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boasters, contrivers of evil, disobedient to parents, 
ROM.1.31	senseless, faithless, unfeeling, unmerciful, 
ROM.1.32	who, although they
ROM.2.1	 Therefore you are without excuse, O man, every one of you who passes judgment. For in that which you pass judgment on someone else, you condemn yourself, for you who are passing judgment are doing the same things. 
ROM.2.2	Now we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who do such things. 
ROM.2.3	But do you think this, O man who passes judgment on those who do such things, and who does the same things, that you will escape the judgment of God? 
ROM.2.4	Or do you despise the wealth of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance? 
ROM.2.5	But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart, you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God, 
ROM.2.6	who will reward each one according to his works: 
ROM.2.7	to those who, by perseverance in good work, seek glory and honor and immortality, eternal life, 
ROM.2.8	but to those who act from selfish ambition and who disobey the truth, but who obey unrighteousness, wrath and anger. 
ROM.2.9	There will be affliction and distress for every human being
ROM.2.10	but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and to the Greek. 
ROM.2.11	For there is no partiality with God. 
ROM.2.12	For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. 
ROM.2.13	For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in the sight of God, but the doers of the law will be declared righteous.
ROM.2.14	For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things of the law, these, although they
ROM.2.15	who show the work of the law written on their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts one after another accusing or even defending them 
ROM.2.16	on the day when God judges the secret things of people, according to my gospel, through
ROM.2.17	But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God 
ROM.2.18	and know his will and approve the things that are superior, because you
ROM.2.19	and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of those in darkness, 
ROM.2.20	an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth in the law. 
ROM.2.21	Therefore, the one who teaches someone else, do you not teach yourself? The one who preaches not to steal, do you steal? 
ROM.2.22	The one who says not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? The one who abhors idols, do you rob temples? 
ROM.2.23	Who boast in the law, by the transgression of the law you dishonor God!
ROM.2.24	For just as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”
ROM.2.25	For circumcision is of value if you do the law, but if you should be a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. 
ROM.2.26	Therefore, if the uncircumcised person follows the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be credited for circumcision? 
ROM.2.27	And the uncircumcised person by nature who carries out the law will judge you who, though provided with the precise written code
ROM.2.28	For the Jew is not one outwardly
ROM.2.29	But the Jew is one inwardly
ROM.3.1	 Therefore, what is the advantage of the Jew, or what is the use of circumcision? 
ROM.3.2	Much in every way. For first, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God. 
ROM.3.3	What is the result
ROM.3.4	May it never be! But let God be true but every human being a liar, just as it is written, 
ROM.3.4	“In order that you may be justified in your words, 
ROM.3.4	and may prevail when you are
ROM.3.5	But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? God, who inflicts wrath, is not unjust, is he? (I am speaking according to a human perspective.) 
ROM.3.6	May it never be! For otherwise, how will God judge the world? 
ROM.3.7	But if by my lying, the truth of God abounded to his glory, why am I also still condemned as a sinner? 
ROM.3.8	And why not (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say), “Let us do evil, in order that good may come of it? Their
ROM.3.9	What then? Do we have an advantage? Not at all. For we have already charged both Jews and Greeks are all under sin, 
ROM.3.10	just as it is written, 
ROM.3.10	“There is no one righteous, not even one; 
ROM.3.11	there is no one who understands; 
ROM.3.11	there is no one who seeks God. 
ROM.3.12	All have turned aside together; they have become worthless; 
ROM.3.12	There is no one who practices kindness; 
ROM.3.12	there is not even one.
ROM.3.13	Their throat is an opened grave; 
ROM.3.13	they deceive with their tongues; 
ROM.3.13	the venom of asps is under their lips,
ROM.3.14	whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
ROM.3.15	Their feet are swift to shed blood; 
ROM.3.16	destruction and distress are in their paths, 
ROM.3.17	and they have not known the way of peace.
ROM.3.18	The fear of God is not before their eyes.”
ROM.3.19	Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those under the law, in order that every mouth may be closed and the whole world may become accountable to God. 
ROM.3.20	For by the works of the law no person will be declared righteous
ROM.3.21	But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified about by the law and the prophets—
ROM.3.22	that is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ
ROM.3.23	for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 
ROM.3.24	being justified as a gift by his grace, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, 
ROM.3.25	whom God made publicly available as the mercy seat
ROM.3.26	in the forbearance of God, for the demonstration of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just and the one who justifies the person by faith
ROM.3.27	Therefore, where is boasting? It has been excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law
ROM.3.28	For we consider a person to be justified by faith apart from the works of the law. 
ROM.3.29	Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, also of the Gentiles, 
ROM.3.30	since God is one, who will justify those who are circumcised
ROM.3.31	Therefore, do we nullify the law through faith? May it never be! But we uphold the law. 
ROM.4.1	 What then shall we say that Abraham, our ancestor according to the flesh, has found? 
ROM.4.2	For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. 
ROM.4.3	For what does the scripture say? “And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness.”
ROM.4.4	Now to the one who works, his pay is not credited according to grace, but according to his due. 
ROM.4.5	But to the one who does not work, but who believes in the one who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited for righteousness, 
ROM.4.6	just as David also speaks about the blessing of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: 
ROM.4.7	“Blessed are they whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, 
ROM.4.7	and whose sins are covered over. 
ROM.4.8	Blessed is the person against whom the Lord will never count sin.”
ROM.4.9	Therefore, is this blessing for those who are circumcised
ROM.4.10	How then was it credited? While he
ROM.4.11	And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal
ROM.4.12	and the father of those who are circumcised
ROM.4.13	For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants, that he would be heir of the world, was not through the law, but through the righteousness by faith. 
ROM.4.14	For if those of the law are heirs, faith is rendered void and the promise is nullified. 
ROM.4.15	For the law produces wrath, but where there is no law, neither is there transgression. 
ROM.4.16	Because of this, it is by faith, in order that it may be according to grace, so that the promise may be secure to all the descendants, not only to those of the law, but also to those of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all 
ROM.4.17	(just as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”)
ROM.4.18	who against hope believed in hope, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was said, “so will your descendants be.”
ROM.4.19	And not being weak in faith, he considered his own body as good as dead, 
ROM.4.20	And he did not waver in unbelief at the promise of God, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God 
ROM.4.21	and being fully convinced that what he had promised, he was also able to do. 
ROM.4.22	Therefore
ROM.4.23	But it was not written for the sake of him alone that it was credited to him, 
ROM.4.24	but also for the sake of us to whom it is going to be credited, to those who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, 
ROM.4.25	who was handed over on account of our trespasses, and was raised up in the interest of our justification.
ROM.5.1	 Therefore, because we
ROM.5.2	through whom also we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we boast in the hope of the glory of God. 
ROM.5.3	And not only this, but we also boast in our afflictions, because we
ROM.5.4	and patient endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope, 
ROM.5.5	and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us. 
ROM.5.6	For while
ROM.5.7	For only rarely will someone die on behalf of a righteous person (for on behalf of a good person possibly someone might even dare to die), 
ROM.5.8	but God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while
ROM.5.9	Therefore, by much more, because we
ROM.5.10	For if, while we
ROM.5.11	And not only this, but also we are boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation. 
ROM.5.12	Because of this, just as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death spread to all people because all sinned. 
ROM.5.13	For until the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not charged to one’s account when there
ROM.5.14	But death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of the one who is to come. 
ROM.5.15	But the gift is not like the trespass
ROM.5.16	And the gift is not as through the one who sinned, for on the one hand, judgment from the one sin led to condemnation, but the gift, from many trespasses, led to justification. 
ROM.5.17	For if by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through the one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ. 
ROM.5.18	Consequently therefore, as through one trespass came condemnation to all people, so also through one righteous deed came justification of life to all people. 
ROM.5.19	For just as through the disobedience of the one man, the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one, the many will be made righteous. 
ROM.5.20	Now the law came in as a side issue, in order that the trespass could increase, but where sin increased, grace was present in greater abundance, 
ROM.5.21	so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
ROM.6.1	 What therefore shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, in order that grace may increase? 
ROM.6.2	May it never be! How can we who died to sin still live in it? 
ROM.6.3	Or do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 
ROM.6.4	Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we may live a new way of life
ROM.6.5	For if we have become identified with him in the likeness of his death, certainly also we will be identified with him in the likeness
ROM.6.6	knowing this, that our old man was crucified together with him, in order that the body of sin may be done away with, that we may no longer be enslaved to sin. 
ROM.6.7	For the one who has died has been freed from sin. 
ROM.6.8	Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him, 
ROM.6.9	knowing that Christ, because he
ROM.6.10	For that death he died, he died to sin once and never again, but that life he lives, he lives to God. 
ROM.6.11	So also you, consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus. 
ROM.6.12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, so that you obey its desires, 
ROM.6.13	and do not present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead, and your members to God as instruments of righteousness. 
ROM.6.14	For sin will not be master over you, because you are not under law, but under grace. 
ROM.6.15	What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be! 
ROM.6.16	Do you not know that to whomever you present yourselves as slaves for obedience, you are slaves to whomever you obey, whether sin, leading to death, or obedience, leading to righteousness? 
ROM.6.17	But thanks be to God that you were slaves of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart the pattern of teaching to which you were entrusted, 
ROM.6.18	and having been set free from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness. 
ROM.6.19	(I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh.) For just as you presented your members as slaves to immorality and lawlessness, leading to lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness, leading to sanctification. 
ROM.6.20	For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with respect to righteousness. 
ROM.6.21	Therefore what sort of fruit did you have then, about which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. 
ROM.6.22	But now, having been set free from sin and having been enslaved to God, you have your fruit leading to sanctification, and its end is eternal life. 
ROM.6.23	For the compensation due sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
ROM.7.1	 Or do you not know, brothers (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law is master of a person for as long a time as he lives? 
ROM.7.2	For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of the husband. 
ROM.7.3	Therefore as a result, if she belongs to another man while
ROM.7.4	So then, my brothers, you also were brought to death with respect to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to the one who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God. 
ROM.7.5	For when we were in the flesh, sinful desires were working through the law in our members, to bear fruit for death. 
ROM.7.6	But now we have been released from the law, because we
ROM.7.7	What then shall we say? Is the law sin? May it never be! But I would not have known sin except through the law, for I would not have known covetousness if the law had not said, “Do not covet.”
ROM.7.8	But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin is dead. 
ROM.7.9	And I was alive once, apart from the law, but when
ROM.7.10	and I died, and this commandment which was to lead to life was found with respect to me to lead to death. 
ROM.7.11	For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. 
ROM.7.12	So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good. 
ROM.7.13	Therefore, did that which is good become death to me? May it never be! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be recognized as sin, producing death through what is good for me, in order that sin might become sinful to an extraordinary degree through the commandment. 
ROM.7.14	For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold into slavery to sin
ROM.7.15	For what I am doing I do not understand, because what I want to do, this I do not practice, but what I hate, this I do. 
ROM.7.16	But if what I do not want to do, this I do, I agree with the law that it is good. 
ROM.7.17	But now I am no longer the one doing it, but sin that lives in me. 
ROM.7.18	For I know that good does not live in me, that is, in my flesh. For the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not. 
ROM.7.19	For the good that I want to do, I do not do, but the evil that I do not want to do, this I do. 
ROM.7.20	But if what I do not want to do, this I am doing, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin that lives in me. 
ROM.7.21	Consequently, I find the principle with me, the one who wants to do good, that evil is present with me.
ROM.7.22	For I joyfully agree with the law of God in my inner person, 
ROM.7.23	but I observe another law in my members, at war with the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that exists in my members. 
ROM.7.24	Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 
ROM.7.25	Thanks be
ROM.8.1	 Consequently, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. 
ROM.8.2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death. 
ROM.8.3	For what was impossible for the law, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did. By
ROM.8.4	in order that the requirement of the law would be fulfilled in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. 
ROM.8.5	For those who are living according to the flesh are intent on the things of the flesh, but those who are living according to the Spirit are intent on the things of the Spirit. 
ROM.8.6	For the mindset of the flesh is death, but the mindset of the Spirit is life and peace, 
ROM.8.7	because the mindset of the flesh is enmity toward God, for it is not subjected to the law of God, for it is not able to do so, 
ROM.8.8	and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God. 
ROM.8.9	But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, this person does not belong to him
ROM.8.10	But if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. 
ROM.8.11	And if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, the one who raised Christ Jesus
ROM.8.12	So then, brothers, we are obligated not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. 
ROM.8.13	For if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. 
ROM.8.14	For all those who are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 
ROM.8.15	For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba!
ROM.8.16	The Spirit himself confirms to our spirit that we are children of God, 
ROM.8.17	and if children, also heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer together with him so that we may also be glorified together with him. 
ROM.8.18	For I consider that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is about to be revealed to us. 
ROM.8.19	For the eagerly expecting creation awaits eagerly the revelation of the sons of God. 
ROM.8.20	For the creation has been subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of the one who subjected it, in hope 
ROM.8.21	that the creation itself also will be set free from its servility to decay, into the glorious freedom of the children of God. 
ROM.8.22	For we know that the whole creation groans together and suffers agony together until now. 
ROM.8.23	Not only this, but we ourselves also, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves while we
ROM.8.24	For in hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, for who hopes for what he sees? 
ROM.8.25	But if we hope for what we do not see, we await it eagerly with patient endurance. 
ROM.8.26	And likewise also, the Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know how to pray as one ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with unexpressed groanings. 
ROM.8.27	And the one who searches our hearts knows what the mindset of the Spirit is, because he intercedes on behalf of the saints according to the will of God. 
ROM.8.28	And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose, 
ROM.8.29	because those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among many brothers. 
ROM.8.30	And those whom he predestined, these he also called, and those whom he called, these he also justified, and those whom he justified, these he also glorified. 
ROM.8.31	What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 
ROM.8.32	Indeed, he who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also, together with him, freely give us all things? 
ROM.8.33	Who will bring charges against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies. 
ROM.8.34	Who is the one who condemns? Christ
ROM.8.35	Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will affliction or distress or persecution or hunger or lack of sufficient clothing or danger or the sword? 
ROM.8.36	Just as it is written, 
ROM.8.36	“On account of you we are being put to death the whole day long; 
ROM.8.36	we are considered as sheep for slaughter.”
ROM.8.37	No, but in all these things we prevail completely through the one who loved us. 
ROM.8.38	For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, 
ROM.8.39	nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
ROM.9.1	 I am telling the truth in Christ—I am not lying; my conscience bears witness to me in the Holy Spirit—
ROM.9.2	that my grief is great and there is constant distress in my heart. 
ROM.9.3	For I could wish myself to be accursed from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my fellow countrymen according to the flesh, 
ROM.9.4	who are Israelites, to whom belong the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the temple service, and the promises, 
ROM.9.5	to whom belong the patriarchs, and from whom is the Christ according to human descent, who is God over all, blessed forever
ROM.9.6	But it is not as if the word of God had failed. For not all those who are descended from Israel are truly Israel, 
ROM.9.7	nor are they all children because they are descendants of Abraham, but “In Isaac will your descendants be named.”
ROM.9.8	That is, it is not the children by human descent
ROM.9.9	For the statement of the promise is this: “At this time I will return and Sarah will have
ROM.9.10	And not only this, but also when
ROM.9.11	for although they
ROM.9.12	not by works but by the one who calls—it was said to her, “The older will serve the younger,”
ROM.9.13	just as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
ROM.9.14	What then shall we say? There is no injustice with God, is there?
ROM.9.15	For to Moses he says, “I will have mercy on whomever I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I have compassion.”
ROM.9.16	Consequently therefore, it does not depend on the
ROM.9.17	For the scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very reason I have raised you up, so that I may demonstrate my power in you, and so that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”
ROM.9.18	Consequently therefore, he has mercy on whomever he wishes, and he hardens whomever he wishes. 
ROM.9.19	Therefore you will say to me, “Why then does he still find fault? For who has resisted
ROM.9.20	On the contrary, O man, who are you who answers back to God? Will what is molded say to the one who molded it, “Why did you make me like this”?
ROM.9.21	Or does the potter not have authority over the clay, to make from the same lump a vessel that is for honorable use
ROM.9.22	And what if God, wanting to demonstrate his wrath and to make known his power, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction? 
ROM.9.23	And he did so
ROM.9.24	us whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? 
ROM.9.25	As he also says in Hosea, 
ROM.9.25	“I will call those who were not my people, ‘My people,’ 
ROM.9.25	and those who were not loved, ‘Loved.’
ROM.9.26	And it will be in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ 
ROM.9.26	there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’ ”
ROM.9.27	And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, 
ROM.9.27	“Even if the number of the sons of Israel is like the sand of the sea, 
ROM.9.27	the remnant will be saved, 
ROM.9.28	for the Lord will execute his sentence thoroughly and decisively
ROM.9.29	And just as Isaiah foretold, 
ROM.9.29	“If the Lord of hosts had not left us descendants, 
ROM.9.29	we would have become like Sodom 
ROM.9.29	and would have resembled Gomorrah.”
ROM.9.30	What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness—even the righteousness that is by faith. 
ROM.9.31	But Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, did not attain to the law. 
ROM.9.32	Why that? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if by works. They stumbled over the stone that causes people to stumble
ROM.9.33	just as it is written, 
ROM.9.33	“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble
ROM.9.33	and a rock that causes them to fall
ROM.9.33	and the one who believes in him will not be put to shame.”
ROM.10.1	 Brothers, the desire of my heart and my prayer to God on behalf of them is for their salvation. 
ROM.10.2	For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. 
ROM.10.3	For ignoring the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own,
ROM.10.4	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. 
ROM.10.5	For Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law: “The person who does this
ROM.10.6	But the righteousness from faith speaks like this: “Do not say in your heart,
ROM.10.7	or “Who will descend into the abyss?”
ROM.10.8	But what does it say? “The word is near to you, in your mouth and in your heart”
ROM.10.9	that
ROM.10.10	For with the heart one believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth one confesses, resulting in salvation. 
ROM.10.11	For the scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.”
ROM.10.12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all, who is rich to all who call upon him. 
ROM.10.13	For “everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.”
ROM.10.14	How then will they call upon him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in him about whom they have not heard? And how will they hear about him without one who preaches to them? 
ROM.10.15	And how will they preach, unless they are sent? Just as it is written, “How timely are the feet of those who bring good news of good things.”
ROM.10.16	But not all have obeyed the good news, for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?”
ROM.10.17	Consequently, faith comes by hearing, and hearing through the word about Christ. 
ROM.10.18	But I say, they have not heard, have they?
ROM.10.18	“Their voice has gone out to all the earth, 
ROM.10.18	and their words to the ends of the inhabited world.”
ROM.10.19	But I say, Israel did not know, did they?
ROM.10.19	“I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are not a nation; 
ROM.10.19	by a senseless nation I will provoke you to anger.”
ROM.10.20	And Isaiah is very bold and says, 
ROM.10.20	“I was found by those who did not seek me; 
ROM.10.20	I became known to those who did not ask for me.”
ROM.10.21	But about Israel he says, 
ROM.10.21	“The whole day long I held out my hands 
ROM.10.21	to a disobedient and resistant people.”
ROM.11.1	 Therefore I say, God has not rejected his people, has he?
ROM.11.2	God has not rejected his people, whom he foreknew! Or do you not know, in the passage about
ROM.11.3	“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life!”
ROM.11.4	But what does the divine response say to him? “I have left for myself seven thousand people
ROM.11.5	So in this way also at the present time, there is a remnant selected by grace
ROM.11.6	But if by grace, it is no longer by works, for otherwise grace would no longer be grace. 
ROM.11.7	What then? What Israel was searching for, this it did not obtain. But the elect obtained it, and the rest were hardened, 
ROM.11.8	just as it is written, 
ROM.11.8	“God gave them a spirit of stupor, 
ROM.11.8	eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear, 
ROM.11.8	until this very day.”
ROM.11.9	And David says, 
ROM.11.9	“Let their table become a snare and a trap, 
ROM.11.9	and a cause for stumbling and a retribution to them; 
ROM.11.10	let their eyes be darkened so that they do not see, 
ROM.11.10	and cause their backs to bend continually
ROM.11.11	I say then, they did not stumble so that they fell, did they?
ROM.11.12	And if their trespass means riches for the world and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness mean? 
ROM.11.13	Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Therefore, inasmuch as I am apostle to the Gentiles, I promote my ministry, 
ROM.11.14	if somehow I may provoke my people to jealousy and save some of them. 
ROM.11.15	For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean except life from the dead? 
ROM.11.16	Now if the first fruits are holy, so also is the whole batch of dough, and if the root is holy, so also are the branches. 
ROM.11.17	Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although you
ROM.11.18	do not boast against the branches. But if you boast against them, you do not support the root, but the root supports you. 
ROM.11.19	Then you will say, “Branches were broken off in order that I could be grafted in.” 
ROM.11.20	Well said! They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand firm because of faith. Do not think arrogant thoughts, but be afraid. 
ROM.11.21	For if God did not spare the natural
ROM.11.22	See, then, the kindness and severity of God: severity upon those who have fallen, but upon you the kindness of God—if you continue in his kindness, for otherwise you also will be cut off. 
ROM.11.23	And those also, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, because God is able to graft them in again. 
ROM.11.24	For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are natural branches
ROM.11.25	For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you will not be wise in your own sight,
ROM.11.26	and so all Israel will be saved, just as it is written, 
ROM.11.26	“The deliverer will come out of Zion; 
ROM.11.26	he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob. 
ROM.11.27	And this is the covenant from me with them
ROM.11.27	when I take away their sins.”
ROM.11.28	With respect to the gospel, they are enemies for your sake, but with respect to election, they are dearly loved for the sake of the fathers. 
ROM.11.29	For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. 
ROM.11.30	For just as you formerly were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of the disobedience of these, 
ROM.11.31	so also these have now been disobedient for your mercy, in order that they also may now be shown mercy. 
ROM.11.32	For God confined them all in disobedience, in order that he could have mercy on them all. 
ROM.11.33	Oh, the depth of the riches 
ROM.11.33	and the wisdom and the knowledge of God! 
ROM.11.33	How unsearchable are his judgments 
ROM.11.33	and how incomprehensible are his ways! 
ROM.11.34	“For who has known the mind of the Lord, 
ROM.11.34	or who has been his counselor?
ROM.11.35	Or who has given in advance to him, 
ROM.11.35	and it will be paid back to him?”
ROM.11.36	For from him and through him and to him are all things. 
ROM.11.36	To him be glory for eternity! Amen. 
ROM.12.1	 Therefore I exhort you, brothers, through the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. 
ROM.12.2	And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, so that you may approve what is the good and well-pleasing and perfect will of God. 
ROM.12.3	For by the grace given to me I say to everyone who is among you not to think more highly of yourself than what one ought to think, but to think sensibly
ROM.12.4	For just as in one body we have many members, but all the members do not have the same function, 
ROM.12.5	in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually
ROM.12.6	but having different gifts according to the grace given to us: if it is prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith; 
ROM.12.7	if it is service, by service; if it is one who teaches, by teaching; 
ROM.12.8	if it is one who exhorts, by exhortation; one who gives, with sincerity; one who leads, with diligence; one who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. 
ROM.12.9	Love must be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; be attached to what is good, 
ROM.12.10	being devoted to one another in brotherly love, esteeming one another more highly in honor, 
ROM.12.11	not lagging in diligence, being enthusiastic in spirit, serving the Lord, 
ROM.12.12	rejoicing in hope, enduring in affliction, being devoted to prayer, 
ROM.12.13	contributing to the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality. 
ROM.12.14	Bless those who persecute,
ROM.12.15	Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep. 
ROM.12.16	Think the same thing toward one another; do not think arrogantly
ROM.12.17	Pay back no one evil for evil. Take thought for what is good in the sight of all people. 
ROM.12.18	If it is possible on your part, be at peace with all people. 
ROM.12.19	Do not take revenge yourselves, dear friends, but give place to God’s wrath, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay,”
ROM.12.20	But “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by
ROM.12.21	Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. 
ROM.13.1	 Let every person be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except by God, and those that exist are put in place by God. 
ROM.13.2	So then, the one who resists authority resists the ordinance which is from God, and those who resist will receive condemnation on themselves. 
ROM.13.3	For rulers are not a cause of terror for a good deed, but for bad conduct. So do you want not to be afraid of authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from it, 
ROM.13.4	for it is God’s servant to you for what is good. But if you do what is bad, be afraid, because it does not bear the sword to no purpose. For it is God’s servant, the one who avenges for punishment on the one who does what is bad. 
ROM.13.5	Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience. 
ROM.13.6	For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities
ROM.13.7	Pay to everyone what is owed: pay taxes to whom taxes are due; pay customs duties to whom customs duties are due; pay respect to whom respect is due; pay honor to whom honor is due.
ROM.13.8	Owe nothing to anyone, except to love one another, for the one who loves someone else has fulfilled the law. 
ROM.13.9	For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, you shall not commit murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet,”
ROM.13.10	Love does not commit evil against a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. 
ROM.13.11	And do this because you
ROM.13.12	The night is far gone, and the day has drawn near. Therefore let us throw off
ROM.13.13	Let us live decently, as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and licentiousness, not in strife and jealousy. 
ROM.13.14	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not make provision for the desires of the flesh. 
ROM.14.1	 Now receive the one who is weak in faith, but not for quarrels about opinions. 
ROM.14.2	One believes he may eat all things, but the one who is weak eats only vegetables. 
ROM.14.3	The one who eats must not despise the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat must not judge the one who eats, because God has accepted him. 
ROM.14.4	Who are you, who passes judgment on the domestic slave belonging to someone else? To his own master he stands or falls, and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand. 
ROM.14.5	One person
ROM.14.6	The one who is intent on the day is intent on it for the Lord, and the one who eats eats for the Lord, because he is thankful to God, and the one who does not eat does not eat for the Lord, and he is thankful to God. 
ROM.14.7	For none of us lives for himself and none dies for himself. 
ROM.14.8	For if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord’s. 
ROM.14.9	For Christ died and became alive again for this reason, in order that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living. 
ROM.14.10	But why do you judge your brother? Or also, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. 
ROM.14.11	For it is written, 
ROM.14.11	“As I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow to me, 
ROM.14.11	and every tongue will praise God.”
ROM.14.12	So
ROM.14.13	Therefore, let us no longer pass judgment on one another, but rather decide this: not to place a cause for stumbling or a temptation before a brother. 
ROM.14.14	I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean of itself, except to the one who considers something to be unclean; to that person it is unclean. 
ROM.14.15	For if because of food, your brother is grieved, you are no longer living according to love. Do not destroy by your food that person for whom Christ died. 
ROM.14.16	Therefore do not let your good be slandered. 
ROM.14.17	For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 
ROM.14.18	For the one who serves Christ in this way is well-pleasing to God and approved by people. 
ROM.14.19	So then, let us pursue what promotes peace
ROM.14.20	Do not destroy the work of God on account of food. All things are clean, but it is wrong for the person who eats and stumbles in the process
ROM.14.21	It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine or to do anything by which your brother stumbles or is offended or is weakened.
ROM.14.22	The faith that you have, have with respect to yourself before God. Blessed is the one who does not pass judgment on himself by what he approves. 
ROM.14.23	But the one who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not do so from faith, and everything that is not from faith is sin. 
ROM.15.1	 But we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves. 
ROM.15.2	Let each one of us please his neighbor for his good, for the purpose of edification. 
ROM.15.3	For even Christ did not please himself, but just as it is written, “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.”
ROM.15.4	For whatever was written beforehand was written for our instruction, in order that through patient endurance and through the encouragement of the scriptures we may have hope. 
ROM.15.5	Now may the God of patient endurance and of encouragement grant you to be in agreement
ROM.15.6	so that with one mind you may glorify with one mouth the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ROM.15.7	Therefore accept one another, just as Christ also has accepted you, to the glory of God. 
ROM.15.8	For I say, Christ has become a servant of the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God, in order to confirm the promises to the fathers, 
ROM.15.9	and that the Gentiles may glorify God for his mercy, just as it is written, 
ROM.15.9	“Because of this, I will praise you among the Gentiles, 
ROM.15.9	and I will sing praise to your name.”
ROM.15.10	And again it says, 
ROM.15.10	“Rejoice, Gentiles, with his people.”
ROM.15.11	And again, 
ROM.15.11	“Praise the Lord, all the Gentiles, 
ROM.15.11	and let all the peoples praise him.”
ROM.15.12	And again Isaiah says, 
ROM.15.12	“The root of Jesse will come, 
ROM.15.12	even the one who rises to rule over the Gentiles; 
ROM.15.12	in him the Gentiles will put their hope.”
ROM.15.13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. 
ROM.15.14	Now I myself also am convinced about you, my brothers, that you yourselves also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to instruct one another. 
ROM.15.15	But I have written to you more boldly on some points, so as to remind you again because of the grace that has been given to me by God, 
ROM.15.16	with the result that I am a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving the gospel of God as a priest, in order that the offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit. 
ROM.15.17	Therefore I have a reason for boasting in Christ Jesus regarding the things concerning God. 
ROM.15.18	For I will not dare to speak about anything except that which Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed, 
ROM.15.19	by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit,
ROM.15.20	And so, having as my ambition to proclaim the gospel where Christ has not been named, in order that I will not build on the foundation belonging to someone else, 
ROM.15.21	but just as it is written, 
ROM.15.21	“Those to whom it was not announced concerning him will see, 
ROM.15.21	and those who have not heard will understand.”
ROM.15.22	For this reason also I was hindered many times from coming to you, 
ROM.15.23	and now, no longer having a place in these regions, but having a desire for many years to come to you 
ROM.15.24	whenever I travel to Spain. For I hope while I
ROM.15.25	But now I am traveling to Jerusalem, serving the saints. 
ROM.15.26	For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem. 
ROM.15.27	For they were pleased to do so, and they are obligated to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they ought also to serve them in material things. 
ROM.15.28	Therefore, after I
ROM.15.29	and I know that when I
ROM.15.30	Now I exhort you, brothers, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit, to contend along with me in your prayers on my behalf to God, 
ROM.15.31	that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and my ministry in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, 
ROM.15.32	so that, coming to you with joy by the will of God, I may rest with you. 
ROM.15.33	Now may the God of peace be with all of you. Amen. 
ROM.16.1	 Now I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is also a servant
ROM.16.2	in order that you may welcome her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and help her in whatever task she may have need from you, for she herself also has been a helper of many, even me myself. 
ROM.16.3	Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, 
ROM.16.4	who risked their own necks for my life, for which not only I am thankful, but also all the churches of the Gentiles; 
ROM.16.5	also greet
ROM.16.6	Greet Mary, who has worked hard
ROM.16.7	Greet Andronicus and Junia,
ROM.16.8	Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord. 
ROM.16.9	Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys. 
ROM.16.10	Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those of the household of Aristobulus. 
ROM.16.11	Greet Herodion my compatriot.
ROM.16.12	Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, the laborers in the Lord. Greet Persis, the dear friend who has worked hard
ROM.16.13	Greet Rufus, the chosen one in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 
ROM.16.14	Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers with them. 
ROM.16.15	Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them. 
ROM.16.16	Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you. 
ROM.16.17	Now I exhort you, brothers, to look out for those who cause dissensions and temptations contrary to the teaching which you learned, and stay away from them. 
ROM.16.18	For such people do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own stomach, and by smooth speech and flattery they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting. 
ROM.16.19	For the report of your obedience has reached to all; therefore I am rejoicing over you, and I want you to be wise toward what is good, but innocent toward what is evil. 
ROM.16.20	And in a short time the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
ROM.16.21	Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my compatriots.
ROM.16.22	I, Tertius, the one who wrote this letter, greet you in the Lord. 
ROM.16.23	Gaius, my host and the host of the whole church, greets you. Erastus the city treasurer greets you, and Quartus the brother. 
ROM.16.24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.
1CO.1.1	 Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, 
1CO.1.2	to the church of God sanctified in Christ Jesus that is in Corinth,
1CO.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
1CO.1.4	I give thanks to my God always concerning you, because of the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus, 
1CO.1.5	that
1CO.1.6	just as the testimony about Christ has been confirmed in you, 
1CO.1.7	so that you do not lack in any spiritual gift as you
1CO.1.8	who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1CO.1.9	God is faithful, by whom you were called to fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. 
1CO.1.10	Now I exhort you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all say the same thing and there not be divisions among you, and that you be made complete in the same mind and with the same purpose. 
1CO.1.11	For it has been made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by Chloe’s people
1CO.1.12	But I say this, that each of you is saying, “I am with Paul,” and “I am with Apollos,” and “I am with Cephas,” and “I am with Christ.” 
1CO.1.13	Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he?
1CO.1.14	I give thanks
1CO.1.15	lest anyone should say that you were baptized in my name. 
1CO.1.16	(Now I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Beyond that I do not know if I baptized anyone else.) 
1CO.1.17	For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the gospel, not with clever speech
1CO.1.18	For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 
1CO.1.19	For it is written, 
1CO.1.19	“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, 
1CO.1.19	and the intelligence of the intelligent I will confound.”
1CO.1.20	Where is the wise person? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 
1CO.1.21	For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe. 
1CO.1.22	For indeed, Jews ask for sign miracles and Greeks seek wisdom, 
1CO.1.23	but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a cause for stumbling, but to the Gentiles foolishness, 
1CO.1.24	but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. 
1CO.1.25	For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom,
1CO.1.26	For consider your calling, brothers, that not many were wise according to human standards,
1CO.1.27	But the foolish things of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the wise, and the weak things of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the strong, 
1CO.1.28	and the insignificant of the world, and the despised, God chose, the things that are not, in order that he might abolish the things that are, 
1CO.1.29	so that all flesh may not boast before God. 
1CO.1.30	But from him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, 
1CO.1.31	so that, just as it is written, “The one who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”
1CO.2.1	 And I, when I
1CO.2.2	For I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. 
1CO.2.3	And I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling, 
1CO.2.4	and my speech and my preaching were not with the persuasiveness
1CO.2.5	in order that your faith would not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. 
1CO.2.6	Now we do speak wisdom among the mature, but wisdom not of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are perishing, 
1CO.2.7	but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery, which God predestined before the ages for our glory, 
1CO.2.8	which none of the rulers of this age knew. For if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 
1CO.2.9	But just as it is written, 
1CO.2.9	“Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, 
1CO.2.9	and have not entered into the heart of man, 
1CO.2.9	all that
1CO.2.10	For
1CO.2.11	For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man that is in him? Thus also no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. 
1CO.2.12	Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, in order that we may know the things freely given to us by God, 
1CO.2.13	things which we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people.
1CO.2.14	But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he is not able to understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. 
1CO.2.15	Now the spiritual person discerns all things, but he himself is judged by no one. 
1CO.2.16	“For who has known the mind of the Lord; who has advised him?”
1CO.3.1	 And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual people, but as to fleshly people, as to infants in Christ. 
1CO.3.2	I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to eat it. But now you are still not able, 
1CO.3.3	for you are still fleshly. For where there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and do you not live like unregenerate people?
1CO.3.4	For whenever anyone says, “I am with Paul,” and another, “I am with Apollos,” are you not merely human? 
1CO.3.5	Therefore, what is Apollos and what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, and to each as the Lord gave. 
1CO.3.6	I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing it to grow. 
1CO.3.7	So then, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who is causing it to grow. 
1CO.3.8	Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one, but each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor. 
1CO.3.9	For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building. 
1CO.3.10	According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building upon it. But each one must direct his attention to how he is building upon it. 
1CO.3.11	For no one is able to lay another foundation than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
1CO.3.12	Now if anyone builds upon the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw, 
1CO.3.13	the work of each one will become evident. For the day will reveal it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the work of each one, of what sort it is. 
1CO.3.14	If anyone’s work that he has built upon it remains, he will receive a reward. 
1CO.3.15	If anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but so as through fire. 
1CO.3.16	Do you not know that you are God’s temple and the Spirit of God dwells in you? 
1CO.3.17	If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy this one. For God’s temple is holy, which you are. 
1CO.3.18	Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks himself to be wise among you in this age, let him become a fool, in order that he may become wise. 
1CO.3.19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it is written, “The one who catches the wise in their craftiness,”
1CO.3.20	and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”
1CO.3.21	So then, let no one boast in people. For all things are yours, 
1CO.3.22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all things are yours, 
1CO.3.23	and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s. 
1CO.4.1	 Thus let a person consider us as servants of Christ and stewards of God’s mysteries. 
1CO.4.2	In this case, moreover, it is sought in stewards that one be found faithful. 
1CO.4.3	But to me it is a very little matter that I be judged by you or by a human court,
1CO.4.4	For I am conscious of nothing against myself, but not by this am I vindicated. But the one who judges me is the Lord. 
1CO.4.5	Therefore do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord should come, who will both enlighten the hidden things of darkness and will reveal the counsels of hearts, and then praise will come to each one from God. 
1CO.4.6	Now I have applied these things, brothers, to myself and Apollos for your sake, in order that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written, lest someone be inflated with pride on behalf of one person against the other. 
1CO.4.7	For who concedes you superiority? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if indeed you received it, why do you boast as if you
1CO.4.8	Already you are satiated! Already you are rich! Apart from us you reign as kings! And would that indeed you reigned as kings, in order that we also might reign as kings with you! 
1CO.4.9	For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as condemned to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to people. 
1CO.4.10	We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are prudent in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, but we are dishonored! 
1CO.4.11	Until the present hour we are both hungry and thirsty and poorly clothed and roughly treated and homeless, 
1CO.4.12	and we toil, working with our own hands. When we are
1CO.4.13	when we are
1CO.4.14	I am not writing these things to shame you, but admonishing you as my dear children. 
1CO.4.15	For if you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I fathered you through the gospel. 
1CO.4.16	Therefore I exhort you, become imitators of me. 
1CO.4.17	Because of this, I have sent to you Timothy, who is my dear and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ Jesus, just as I teach everywhere in every church. 
1CO.4.18	But some have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you. 
1CO.4.19	But I am coming to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will know not the talk of the ones who have become arrogant, but the power. 
1CO.4.20	For the kingdom of God is not with talk, but with power. 
1CO.4.21	What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness? 
1CO.5.1	 It is reported everywhere that there is sexual immorality among you, and sexual immorality of such a kind which does not even exist among the Gentiles, so that someone has the wife of his father. 
1CO.5.2	And you are inflated with pride, and should you not rather have mourned, so that the one who has done this deed would be removed from your midst? 
1CO.5.3	For although I
1CO.5.4	In the name of our Lord Jesus, when
1CO.5.5	I have decided
1CO.5.6	Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough? 
1CO.5.7	Clean out the old leaven in order that you may be a new batch of dough, just as you are unleavened. For Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. 
1CO.5.8	So then, let us celebrate the feast, not with the old leaven or with the leaven of wickedness and sinfulness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 
1CO.5.9	I wrote to you in the letter not to associate with sexually immoral people. 
1CO.5.10	By no means did I mean the sexually immoral people of this world or the greedy people and swindlers or idolaters, since then you would have to depart out of the world. 
1CO.5.11	But now I have written to you not to associate with any so-called brother, if he is a sexually immoral person or a greedy person or an idolater or an abusive person or a drunkard or a swindler—with such a person not even to eat. 
1CO.5.12	For what is it to me to judge those outside? Should you not judge those inside? 
1CO.5.13	But those outside God will judge. Remove the evil person from among yourselves
1CO.6.1	 Does anyone among you, if he
1CO.6.2	Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if by you the world is judged, are you unworthy of the most insignificant courts? 
1CO.6.3	Do you not know that we will judge angels, not to mention ordinary matters? 
1CO.6.4	Therefore, if you have courts with regard to ordinary matters, do you seat
1CO.6.5	I say this to your shame. So is there not anyone wise among you who will be able to render a decision between his brothers? 
1CO.6.6	But brother goes to court with brother, and this before unbelievers! 
1CO.6.7	Therefore it is already completely a loss for you that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded? 
1CO.6.8	But you wrong and defraud, and do this to brothers! 
1CO.6.9	Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! Neither sexually immoral people, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor passive homosexual partners, nor dominant homosexual partners, 
1CO.6.10	nor thieves, nor greedy persons, not drunkards, not abusive persons, not swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 
1CO.6.11	And some of you were these things, but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
1CO.6.12	All things are permitted for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are permitted for me, but I will not be controlled by anything. 
1CO.6.13	Food is for the stomach, and the stomach for food, but God will abolish both of them
1CO.6.14	And God both raised up the Lord and will raise us up by his power. 
1CO.6.15	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Therefore, shall I take away the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be! 
1CO.6.16	Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For it says, “The two will become one flesh.”
1CO.6.17	But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with him. 
1CO.6.18	Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a person commits is outside his body, but the one who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body. 
1CO.6.19	Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? 
1CO.6.20	For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God with your body. 
1CO.7.1	 Now concerning the things about which you wrote: “It is good for a man not to touch
1CO.7.2	But because of sexual immorality, let each man have
1CO.7.3	The husband must fulfill his obligation to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband. 
1CO.7.4	The wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband does. And likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but his wife does. 
1CO.7.5	Do not defraud one another, except perhaps by agreement, for a time, in order that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then you should be together
1CO.7.6	But I say this as a concession, not as a command. 
1CO.7.7	I wish all people could be like myself, but each one has his own gift from God, one in this way and another in that way. 
1CO.7.8	Now I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain as I am. 
1CO.7.9	But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire. 
1CO.7.10	To the married I command—not I, but the Lord—a wife must not separate from her husband. 
1CO.7.11	But if indeed she does separate, she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. 
1CO.7.12	Now to the rest I say—not the Lord—if any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her. 
1CO.7.13	And if any wife has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her, she must not divorce her husband. 
1CO.7.14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother, since otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy. 
1CO.7.15	But if the unbeliever leaves, let him leave. The brother or the sister is not bound in such cases. But God has called us
1CO.7.16	For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? 
1CO.7.17	But to each one as the Lord has apportioned. As God has called each one, thus let him live—and thus I order in all the churches. 
1CO.7.18	Was anyone called after
1CO.7.19	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. 
1CO.7.20	Each one in the calling in which he was called—in this he should remain. 
1CO.7.21	Were you called while a slave? Do not let it be a concern to you. But if indeed you are able to become free, rather make use of it. 
1CO.7.22	For the one who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord’s freedperson. Likewise the one who is called while free is a slave of Christ. 
1CO.7.23	You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. 
1CO.7.24	Each one in the situation in which he was called, brothers—in this he should remain with God. 
1CO.7.25	Now concerning virgins I do not have a command from the Lord, but I am giving an opinion as one shown mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy. 
1CO.7.26	Therefore, I consider this to be good because of the impending distress, that it is good for a man to be thus. 
1CO.7.27	Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek release. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. 
1CO.7.28	But if you marry, you have not sinned, and if the virgin marries, she has not sinned. But such people will have affliction in the flesh, and I would spare you. 
1CO.7.29	But I say this, brothers: the time is shortened, that from now on even those who have wives should be as if they do not have wives, 
1CO.7.30	and those who weep as if they do not weep, and those who rejoice as if they do not rejoice, and those who buy as if they do not possess, 
1CO.7.31	and those who make use of the world as if they do not make full use of it. For the present form of this world is passing away. 
1CO.7.32	But I want you to be free from care. The unmarried person cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord. 
1CO.7.33	But the one who is married cares for the things of the world, how he may please his wife, 
1CO.7.34	and he is divided. And the unmarried woman or the virgin cares for the things of the Lord, in order that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But the married woman cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. 
1CO.7.35	Now I am saying this for your own benefit, not that I may put a restriction on you, but to promote appropriate and devoted service to the Lord without distraction. 
1CO.7.36	But if anyone thinks he is behaving dishonorably concerning his virgin, if she is past her prime
1CO.7.37	But he who stands firm in his heart, not having necessity, but has authority concerning his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin, he will do well. 
1CO.7.38	So then, the one who marries
1CO.7.39	A wife is bound for as long a time as her husband lives. But if her husband dies
1CO.7.40	But she is happier if she remains thus, according to my opinion—and I think I have the Spirit of God. 
1CO.8.1	 Now concerning food sacrificed to idols, we know that “we all have knowledge.”
1CO.8.2	If anyone thinks he knows anything, he has not yet known as it is necessary to know. 
1CO.8.3	But if anyone loves God, this one is known by him. 
1CO.8.4	Therefore, concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that “an idol is nothing in the world” and that “there is no God except one.”
1CO.8.5	For even if after all there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many gods and many lords, 
1CO.8.6	yet to us there is one God, the Father, 
1CO.8.6	from whom are all things, and we are for him, 
1CO.8.6	and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, 
1CO.8.6	through whom are all things, and we are through him. 
1CO.8.7	But this knowledge is not in everyone. But some, being accustomed until now to the idol, eat this food as food sacrificed to idols, and their conscience, because it
1CO.8.8	But food does not bring us close to God. For neither if we eat do we have more, nor if we do not eat do we lack.
1CO.8.9	But watch out lest somehow this right of yours becomes a cause for stumbling to the weak. 
1CO.8.10	For if someone should see you who has knowledge reclining for a meal in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, because it
1CO.8.11	For the one who is weak—the brother for whom Christ died—is destroyed by your knowledge. 
1CO.8.12	Now if you
1CO.8.13	Therefore, if food causes my brother to sin, I will never eat meat forever
1CO.9.1	 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? 
1CO.9.2	If to others I am not an apostle, yet indeed I am to you, for you are my seal of apostleship in the Lord. 
1CO.9.3	My defense to those who examine me is this: 
1CO.9.4	Do we not have the right to eat and drink? 
1CO.9.5	Do we not have the right to take along a sister as wife, like the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? 
1CO.9.6	Or do only I and Barnabas not have the right to refrain from working
1CO.9.7	Who ever serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it? Who
1CO.9.8	I am not saying these things according to a human perspective. Or does the law not also say these things? 
1CO.9.9	For in the law of Moses it is written, “You must not muzzle an ox while it
1CO.9.10	Or doubtless does he speak for our sake
1CO.9.11	If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too great a thing if we reap material things from you? 
1CO.9.12	If others share this right over you, do we not do so even more? Yet we have not made use of this right, but we endure all things, in order that we may not cause any hindrance to the gospel of Christ. 
1CO.9.13	Do you not know that those performing the holy services eat the things from the temple, and those attending to the altar have a share with the altar? 
1CO.9.14	In the same way also the Lord ordered those who proclaim the gospel to live from the gospel. 
1CO.9.15	But I have not made use of any of these rights. And I am not writing these things in order that it may be thus with me. For it would be better to me rather to die than for anyone to deprive me of my reason for boasting. 
1CO.9.16	For if I proclaim the gospel, it is not to me a reason for boasting, for necessity is imposed on me. For woe is to me if I do not proclaim the gospel. 
1CO.9.17	For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward, but if I do so unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a stewardship. 
1CO.9.18	What then is my reward? That when I
1CO.9.19	For although I
1CO.9.20	I have become like a Jew to the Jews, in order that I may gain the Jews. To those under the law I became as under the law (although I
1CO.9.21	To those outside the law I became as outside the law (although I
1CO.9.22	To the weak I became weak, in order that I may gain the weak. I have become all things to all people, in order that by all means I may save some. 
1CO.9.23	I do all this for the sake of the gospel, in order that I may become a participant with it. 
1CO.9.24	Do you not know that those who run in the stadium all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win. 
1CO.9.25	And everyone who competes exercises self-control in all things. Thus those do so in order that they may receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one. 
1CO.9.26	Therefore I run in this way, not as running aimlessly; I box in this way, not as beating the air. 
1CO.9.27	But I discipline my body and subjugate it, lest somehow after
1CO.10.1	 For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all went through the sea, 
1CO.10.2	and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, 
1CO.10.3	and all ate the same spiritual food, 
1CO.10.4	and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ. 
1CO.10.5	But God was not pleased with the majority of them, for they were struck down in the desert. 
1CO.10.6	Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we should not be desirers of evil things, just as those also desired them, 
1CO.10.7	and not become idolaters, as some of them did, just as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play,”
1CO.10.8	nor commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed sexual immorality, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day, 
1CO.10.9	nor put Christ to the test, as some of them tested him, and were destroyed by snakes, 
1CO.10.10	nor grumble, just as some of them grumbled, and were destroyed by the destroyer. 
1CO.10.11	Now these things happened to those people as an example, but are written for our instruction, on whom the ends of the ages have come. 
1CO.10.12	Therefore, the one who thinks that he stands must watch out lest he fall. 
1CO.10.13	Temptation has not come upon you except what is common to humanity. But God is faithful, who will not permit you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but will also make a way out together with the temptation, so that you may be able to endure it. 
1CO.10.14	Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. 
1CO.10.15	I am speaking as to sensible people; you judge what I am saying. 
1CO.10.16	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? 
1CO.10.17	Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all share from the one bread. 
1CO.10.18	Consider Israel according to the flesh: are not the ones who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar? 
1CO.10.19	Therefore, what am I saying? That food sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? 
1CO.10.20	No, but that the things which they sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to become sharers with demons. 
1CO.10.21	You are not able to drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You are not able to share the table of the Lord and the table of demons. 
1CO.10.22	Or are we attempting to provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than he is, are we?
1CO.10.23	All things are permitted, but not all things are profitable. All things are permitted, but not all things build up. 
1CO.10.24	Let no one seek his own good
1CO.10.25	Eat everything that is sold in the meat market, asking no questions
1CO.10.26	for “the earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness.”
1CO.10.27	If any of the unbelievers invites you, and you want to go, eat everything that is set before you, asking no questions
1CO.10.28	But if someone says to you, “This is offered to idols,” do not eat it, for the sake of that one who informed you and the conscience. 
1CO.10.29	Now I am not speaking about your own conscience, but the conscience of the other person. For why is my freedom judged by another’s conscience? 
1CO.10.30	If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks? 
1CO.10.31	Therefore, whether you eat or you drink or whatever you do, do all things for the glory of God. 
1CO.10.32	Give no offense
1CO.10.33	just as I also please all people in all things, not seeking my own benefit, but the benefit of the many, in order that they may be saved. 
1CO.11.1	 Become imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ. 
1CO.11.2	Now I praise you that you remember me in all things, and just as I handed over to you the traditions, you hold fast to them. 
1CO.11.3	But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and the head of Christ is God. 
1CO.11.4	Every man who prays or prophesies while
1CO.11.5	but every woman who prays or prophesies with uncovered head dishonors her head, for she is one and the same with the one whose head is shaved. 
1CO.11.6	For if a woman does not cover herself, let her hair be shorn off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her head
1CO.11.7	For indeed a man ought not to cover his head, because he
1CO.11.8	For man is not from woman, but woman from man. 
1CO.11.9	For indeed man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man. 
1CO.11.10	Because of this, the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, on account of the angels. 
1CO.11.11	Nevertheless, neither is woman anything apart from man, nor is man anything apart from woman in the Lord. 
1CO.11.12	For just as the woman is from the man, thus also the man is through the woman. But all things are from God. 
1CO.11.13	You judge for yourselves
1CO.11.14	And does not nature itself teach you that a man, if he wears long hair, it is a dishonor to him? 
1CO.11.15	But a woman, if she wears long hair, it is her glory, because her hair is given
1CO.11.16	But if anyone is disposed to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God. 
1CO.11.17	But in giving this instruction I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse. 
1CO.11.18	For in the first place, when you
1CO.11.19	For indeed it is necessary that there be factions among you, in order that those who are approved may become evident among you. 
1CO.11.20	Therefore, when
1CO.11.21	For when you
1CO.11.22	For do you not have houses for eating and drinking? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who do not have anything? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you! 
1CO.11.23	For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was betrayed, took bread, 
1CO.11.24	and after he
1CO.11.25	Likewise also the cup, after they had eaten, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” 
1CO.11.26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. 
1CO.11.27	So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. 
1CO.11.28	But let a person examine himself, and in this way let him eat from the bread and let him drink from the cup. 
1CO.11.29	For the one who eats and drinks, if he
1CO.11.30	Because of this, many are weak and sick among you, and quite a few have died
1CO.11.31	But if we were evaluating ourselves, we would not be judged. 
1CO.11.32	But if we
1CO.11.33	So then, my brothers, when you
1CO.11.34	If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And I will give directions about the remaining matters whenever I come. 
1CO.12.1	 Now concerning spiritual gifts,
1CO.12.2	You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to the speechless idols, however you were led. 
1CO.12.3	Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is accursed,” and no one is able to say “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit. 
1CO.12.4	Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit, 
1CO.12.5	and there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord, 
1CO.12.6	and there are varieties of activities, but the same God, who works all things in all people. 
1CO.12.7	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is beneficial to all. 
1CO.12.8	For to one is given a word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another a word of knowledge by the same Spirit, 
1CO.12.9	to another faith by the same Spirit, to another
1CO.12.10	to another
1CO.12.11	But in all these things one and the same Spirit is at work, distributing to each one individually just as he wishes. 
1CO.12.12	For just as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, although they
1CO.12.13	For by
1CO.12.14	For the body is not one member, but many. 
1CO.12.15	If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,” not because of this is it not a part of the body. 
1CO.12.16	And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body, not because of this is it not a part of the body. 
1CO.12.17	If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? 
1CO.12.18	But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body just as he wanted. 
1CO.12.19	And if they all were one member, where would the body be? 
1CO.12.20	But now there are many members, but one body. 
1CO.12.21	Now the eye is not able to say to the hand, “I do not have need of you,” or again, the head to the feet, “I do not have need of you.” 
1CO.12.22	But by much more the members of the body which are thought to be weaker are necessary, 
1CO.12.23	and the parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor, and our unpresentable parts come to have more abundant presentability, 
1CO.12.24	but our presentable parts do not have need of this. Yet God composed the body by giving more abundant honor to the part which lacked it, 
1CO.12.25	in order that there not be a division in the body, but the members would have the same concern for one another. 
1CO.12.26	And if one member suffers, all the members suffer together; if a member
1CO.12.27	Now you are the body of Christ, and members of it individually
1CO.12.28	and whom God has appointed in the church: first, apostles, second, prophets, third, teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, kinds of tongues. 
1CO.12.29	Not all are apostles, are they?
1CO.12.30	Not all have gifts of healing, do they?
1CO.12.31	But strive
1CO.13.1	 If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a ringing brass gong or a clashing cymbal. 
1CO.13.2	And if I have the gift of prophecy and I know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 
1CO.13.3	And if I parcel out all my possessions, and if I hand over my body in order that I will be burned,
1CO.13.4	Love is patient, love is kind, love is not jealous, it does not boast, it does not become conceited, 
1CO.13.5	it does not behave dishonorably, it is not selfish
1CO.13.6	it does not rejoice at unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth, 
1CO.13.7	bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 
1CO.13.8	Love never ends. But if there are prophecies, they will pass away. If there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will pass away. 
1CO.13.9	For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 
1CO.13.10	but whenever the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. 
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I set aside the things of a child. 
1CO.13.12	For now we see through a mirror indirectly
1CO.13.13	And now these three things remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love. 
1CO.14.1	 Pursue love, and strive for spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy. 
1CO.14.2	For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God, because no one understands, but by the Spirit
1CO.14.3	But the one who prophesies speaks to people edification and encouragement and consolation. 
1CO.14.4	The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies edifies the church. 
1CO.14.5	Now I want you all to speak with tongues, but even more that you may prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks with tongues, unless he interprets, in order that the church may receive edification. 
1CO.14.6	But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, how do I benefit you, unless I speak to you either with a revelation or with knowledge or with a prophecy or with a teaching? 
1CO.14.7	Likewise, the inanimate things which produce a sound, whether flute or lyre, if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the lyre? 
1CO.14.8	For indeed, if the trumpet produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare for battle? 
1CO.14.9	And so you through the tongue, unless you produce a clear message, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air. 
1CO.14.10	There are probably so many kinds of languages in the world, and none without meaning. 
1CO.14.11	Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a barbarian to the one who is speaking, and the one who is speaking will be a barbarian in my judgment. 
1CO.14.12	In this way also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek for the edification of the church, in order that you may abound. 
1CO.14.13	Therefore the one who speaks in a tongue must pray that he may interpret. 
1CO.14.14	For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive. 
1CO.14.15	Therefore what should I do
1CO.14.16	For otherwise, if you praise in your spirit, how will the one who fills the place of the outsider say the “amen” at your thanksgiving, because he does not know what you are saying? 
1CO.14.17	For indeed you are giving thanks well, but the other person is not edified. 
1CO.14.18	I give thanks to God that I speak with tongues more than all of you, 
1CO.14.19	but in the church I prefer to speak five words with my mind, in order that I may instruct other people, than ten thousand words in a tongue. 
1CO.14.20	Brothers, do not become children in your understanding, but with respect to wickedness be as a child, and in your understanding be mature. 
1CO.14.21	In the law it is written: 
1CO.14.21	“By those who speak a foreign language 
1CO.14.21	and by the lips of others 
1CO.14.21	I will speak to this people, 
1CO.14.21	and not even in this way will they obey me,”
1CO.14.21	says the Lord. 
1CO.14.22	So then, tongues are for a sign not to those who believe, but to unbelievers, but prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for those who believe. 
1CO.14.23	Therefore, if the whole church comes together at the same time and all speak with tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds? 
1CO.14.24	But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all, 
1CO.14.25	the secret things of his heart become evident, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God, proclaiming, “God is truly among you!” 
1CO.14.26	Therefore what should you do
1CO.14.27	If anyone speaks in a tongue, it must be on one occasion two or at most three, and one after the other
1CO.14.28	But if there is no interpreter, he must be silent in the church, but let him speak to himself and to God. 
1CO.14.29	Let two or three prophets speak, and the others evaluate. 
1CO.14.30	And if something is revealed to another who is seated, the first must be silent. 
1CO.14.31	For you are all able to prophesy in turn
1CO.14.32	and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. 
1CO.14.33	For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. 
1CO.14.33	As in all the churches of the saints, 
1CO.14.34	the women must be silent in the churches, for it is not permitted for them to speak, but they must be in submission, just as the law also says. 
1CO.14.35	But if they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church. 
1CO.14.36	Or has the word of God gone out from you, or has it come to you only? 
1CO.14.37	If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual,
1CO.14.38	But if anyone ignores this, he is ignored.
1CO.14.39	So then, my brothers, desire to prophesy, and do not prevent speaking with tongues. 
1CO.14.40	But let all things be done decently and according to proper procedure. 
1CO.15.1	 Now I make known to you, brothers, the gospel which I proclaimed to you, which you have also received, in which you also stand, 
1CO.15.2	by which you are also being saved, if you hold fast to the message I proclaimed to you, unless you believed to no purpose. 
1CO.15.3	For I passed on to you as of first importance
1CO.15.4	and that he was buried, and that he was raised up on the third day according to the scriptures, 
1CO.15.5	and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve, 
1CO.15.6	then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, the majority of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep. 
1CO.15.7	Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, 
1CO.15.8	and last of all, as it were to one born at the wrong time, he appeared also to me. 
1CO.15.9	For I am the least of the apostles, not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
1CO.15.10	But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me has not been in vain, but I labored even more than all of them, and not I, but the grace of God with me. 
1CO.15.11	Therefore whether I or those, in this way we preached, and in this way you believed. 
1CO.15.12	Now if Christ is preached as raised up from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
1CO.15.13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead, Christ has not been raised either. 
1CO.15.14	But if Christ has not been raised, then
1CO.15.15	And also we are found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if after all, then, the dead are not raised. 
1CO.15.16	For if the dead are not raised, Christ has not been raised either. 
1CO.15.17	But if Christ has not been raised, your faith is empty; you are still in your sins. 
1CO.15.18	And as a further result, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. 
1CO.15.19	If we have put our hope
1CO.15.20	But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep. 
1CO.15.21	For since through a man came death, also through a man came the resurrection of the dead. 
1CO.15.22	For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive. 
1CO.15.23	But each in his own group: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ’s at his coming, 
1CO.15.24	then the end, when he hands over the kingdom to the God and Father, when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power. 
1CO.15.25	For it is necessary for him to reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. 
1CO.15.26	The last enemy to be abolished is death. 
1CO.15.27	For “he subjected all things under his feet.”
1CO.15.28	But whenever all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected
1CO.15.29	Otherwise, why do they do it, those who are being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why indeed are they being baptized on behalf of them? 
1CO.15.30	And why are we in danger every hour? 
1CO.15.31	I die every day—yes indeed, by my boasting in you,
1CO.15.32	If according to a human perspective I fought wild beasts at Ephesus, what benefit is it to me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.
1CO.15.33	Do not be deceived! “Bad company corrupts good morals.”
1CO.15.34	Sober up correctly and stop sinning
1CO.15.35	But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what sort of body do they come?” 
1CO.15.36	Foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 
1CO.15.37	And what you sow is not the body which it will become, but you sow the bare seed, whether perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest. 
1CO.15.38	But God gives to it a body just as he wishes, and to each one of the seeds its own body. 
1CO.15.39	Not all flesh is the same, but there is one flesh of human beings, and another flesh of animals, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish, 
1CO.15.40	and heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly bodies is of one kind, and the glory of the earthly bodies is of another kind. 
1CO.15.41	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars, for star differs from star in glory. 
1CO.15.42	Thus also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility. 
1CO.15.43	It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. 
1CO.15.44	It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 
1CO.15.45	Thus also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul”;
1CO.15.46	But the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual. 
1CO.15.47	The first man is from the earth, made of earth; the second man is from heaven. 
1CO.15.48	As the one who is made of earth, so also are those who are made of earth, and as the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly. 
1CO.15.49	And just as we have borne the image of the one who is made of earth, we will also bear the image of the heavenly. 
1CO.15.50	But I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God, nor can corruption inherit incorruptibility. 
1CO.15.51	Behold, I tell you a mystery: we will not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed, 
1CO.15.52	in a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 
1CO.15.53	For it is necessary for this perishable body to put on incorruptibility, and this mortal body to put on immortality. 
1CO.15.54	But whenever this perishable body puts on incorruptibility and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will take place: 
1CO.15.54	“Death is swallowed up in victory. 
1CO.15.55	Where, O death, is your victory? 
1CO.15.55	Where, O death, is your sting? 
1CO.15.56	Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 
1CO.15.57	But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ! 
1CO.15.58	So then, my dear brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, because you
1CO.16.1	 Now concerning the collection for the saints: just as I gave directions about it to the churches of Galatia, so you do also. 
1CO.16.2	On the first day of the week, each one of you put aside
1CO.16.3	And whenever I arrive, whomever you approve by letters, I will send these to take your gift to Jerusalem. 
1CO.16.4	And if it is worthwhile for me to go also, they will travel with me. 
1CO.16.5	But I will come to you whenever I go through Macedonia (for I am going through Macedonia), 
1CO.16.6	and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I may go. 
1CO.16.7	For I do not want to see you now in passing, for I hope to remain some time with you, if the Lord allows it. 
1CO.16.8	But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost, 
1CO.16.9	for a great and effective door has opened for me, and there are many opponents. 
1CO.16.10	But if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without cause to fear, for he is carrying out the Lord’s work, as I also am. 
1CO.16.11	Therefore do not let anyone disdain him, but send him on his way in peace in order that he may come to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers. 
1CO.16.12	Now concerning Apollos our brother, I urged him many times that he should come to you with the brothers, and he was not at all willing that he should come now, but he will come whenever he has an opportunity. 
1CO.16.13	Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act courageously, be strong. 
1CO.16.14	All your actions must be done in love. 
1CO.16.15	Now I urge you, brothers—you know about the household of Stephanas, that they are the first fruits of Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the ministry for the saints—
1CO.16.16	that you also be subject to such people, and to all those who work together and labor. 
1CO.16.17	Now I rejoice over the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because these make up for your absence, 
1CO.16.18	for they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore recognize such people. 
1CO.16.19	The churches of the province of Asia
1CO.16.20	All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
1CO.16.21	The greeting is by my hand—Paul’s. 
1CO.16.22	If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed. O Lord, come!
1CO.16.23	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. 
1CO.16.24	My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. 
2CO.1.1	 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth, together with all the saints who are in all Achaia. 
2CO.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
2CO.1.3	Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, 
2CO.1.4	who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in all affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. 
2CO.1.5	For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, thus through Christ our comfort overflows also. 
2CO.1.6	But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort that is at work in the patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer. 
2CO.1.7	And our hope for you is firm, because we
2CO.1.8	For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning our affliction that happened in the province of Asia,
2CO.1.9	But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, so that we would not be putting confidence in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead, 
2CO.1.10	who delivered us from so great a risk of death, and will deliver us, in whom we have put our hope that he will also deliver us again, 
2CO.1.11	while
2CO.1.12	For our reason for boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you, in holiness
2CO.1.13	For we are not writing anything else to you except what you can read or also understand. But I hope that you will understand completely
2CO.1.14	just as you have also understood us in part, that we are your reason for boasting, just as you are also ours in the day of our Lord Jesus. 
2CO.1.15	And with this confidence, I was wanting to come to you previously, in order that you may have a second proof of my goodwill, 
2CO.1.16	and through you to go to Macedonia, and to come to you again from Macedonia, and to be sent on my way by you to Judea. 
2CO.1.17	Therefore, when I
2CO.1.18	But God is faithful, so that our word to you is not “yes” and “no.” 
2CO.1.19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the one who was proclaimed among you by us, by me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become “yes” and “no,” but has become “yes” in him. 
2CO.1.20	For as many as are the promises of God, in him they are “yes”; therefore also through him is the “amen” to the glory of God through us. 
2CO.1.21	Now the one who establishes us together with you in Christ and who anoints us is God, 
2CO.1.22	who also sealed us and gave the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts. 
2CO.1.23	But I call upon God as witness against my life, that in order to
2CO.1.24	Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are fellow workers for your joy, because by faith you stand firm. 
2CO.2.1	 For I have decided this for myself, not to come to you again in sorrow. 
2CO.2.2	For if I cause you sorrow, then who will make me glad except the one who is caused to be sad by me? 
2CO.2.3	And I wrote this very thing in order that when I
2CO.2.4	For out of great distress and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not so that you may be caused to be sad, but so that you may know the love that I have especially for you. 
2CO.2.5	But if anyone has caused sorrow, he has not caused me sorrow, but to some degree
2CO.2.6	This punishment by the majority is sufficient for such a person. 
2CO.2.7	So then, you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest somehow this person should be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. 
2CO.2.8	Therefore I urge you to confirm your love for him. 
2CO.2.9	Because for this reason also I wrote, in order that I could know your proven character, whether you are obedient in everything. 
2CO.2.10	Now to whomever you forgive anything, I also do; for indeed, whatever I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is for your sake
2CO.2.11	in order that we may not be exploited by Satan (for we are not ignorant of his schemes). 
2CO.2.12	Now when I
2CO.2.13	I did not experience rest in my spirit, because
2CO.2.14	But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ, and who reveals the fragrance of the knowledge of him through us in every place. 
2CO.2.15	For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, 
2CO.2.16	to those on the one hand an odor from death to death, and to those on the other hand a fragrance from life to life. And who is qualified for these things? 
2CO.2.17	For we are not like the majority who peddle the word of God, but as from pure motives—but as from God—we speak before God in Christ. 
2CO.3.1	 Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we, like some, need letters of recommendation to you or from you? 
2CO.3.2	You are our letter, inscribed on our hearts, known and read by all people, 
2CO.3.3	revealing that you are a letter of Christ, delivered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets but on tablets of human hearts. 
2CO.3.4	Now we possess such confidence through Christ toward God. 
2CO.3.5	Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God, 
2CO.3.6	who also makes us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit, for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. 
2CO.3.7	But if the ministry of death in letters carved on stone came with glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to look intently into the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, which was transitory, 
2CO.3.8	how will the ministry of the Spirit not be even more with glory? 
2CO.3.9	For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, by much more will the ministry of righteousness overflow with glory. 
2CO.3.10	For indeed what had been glorified has not been glorified in this case, on account of the glory that surpasses it. 
2CO.3.11	For if what was transitory came with glory, by much more what remains is with glory. 
2CO.3.12	Therefore, because we
2CO.3.13	and not as Moses used to place a veil over his face, in order that the sons of Israel would not stare at the end of what was transitory. 
2CO.3.14	But their minds were hardened. For until this very day, the same veil remains upon the reading of the old covenant, not being uncovered, because it is done away with in Christ. 
2CO.3.15	But until today, whenever Moses is read aloud, a veil lies upon their heart, 
2CO.3.16	but whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. 
2CO.3.17	Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 
2CO.3.18	And we all, with unveiled face, reflecting
2CO.4.1	 Because of this, since we
2CO.4.2	but we have renounced shameful hidden things, not behaving with craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but with the open proclamation of the truth commending ourselves to every person’s conscience before God. 
2CO.4.3	But if indeed our gospel is veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing, 
2CO.4.4	among whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that they would not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 
2CO.4.5	For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Christ Jesus
2CO.4.6	For God who said, “Light will shine out of darkness,”
2CO.4.7	But we have this treasure in earthenware jars, in order that the extraordinary degree of the power may be from God and not from us. 
2CO.4.8	We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing; 
2CO.4.9	persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed; 
2CO.4.10	always carrying around the death of Jesus in our body, in order that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. 
2CO.4.11	For we who are alive are continually being handed over to death because of Jesus, in order that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal flesh. 
2CO.4.12	So then, death is at work in us, but life in you. 
2CO.4.13	But because we
2CO.4.14	because we
2CO.4.15	For all these things are for your sake
2CO.4.16	Therefore we do not lose heart, but even if our outer person is being destroyed, yet our inner person is being renewed day after day. 
2CO.4.17	For our momentary light affliction is producing in us an eternal weight of glory beyond all measure and proportion
2CO.4.18	because
2CO.5.1	 For we know that if our earthly house, the tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by hands, eternal in the heavens. 
2CO.5.2	For indeed, in this house we groan, because we
2CO.5.3	if indeed, even after we
2CO.5.4	For indeed we who are in this tent groan, being burdened for this reason, that
2CO.5.5	Now the one who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the down payment, the Spirit. 
2CO.5.6	Therefore, although we are
2CO.5.7	for we live by faith, not by sight—
2CO.5.8	so we are confident and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord. 
2CO.5.9	Therefore indeed we have as our ambition, whether at home in the body or absent from the body, to be acceptable to him. 
2CO.5.10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, in order that each one may receive back the things through the body according to what he has done, whether good or bad. 
2CO.5.11	Therefore, because we
2CO.5.12	We are not commending ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to boast about us, in order that you may have an answer for those who boast in appearance and not in heart. 
2CO.5.13	For if we are out of our senses, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you. 
2CO.5.14	For the love of Christ controls us, because we
2CO.5.15	And he died for all, in order that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for the one who died for them and was raised. 
2CO.5.16	So then, from now on we know no one from a human point of view
2CO.5.17	Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, new things have come. 
2CO.5.18	And all these things are from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ, and who has given us the ministry of reconciliation, 
2CO.5.19	namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. 
2CO.5.20	Therefore we are ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as if
2CO.5.21	He made the one who did not know sin to be sin on our behalf, in order that we could become the righteousness of God in him. 
2CO.6.1	 Now because we
2CO.6.2	For he says, 
2CO.6.2	“At the acceptable time I heard you, 
2CO.6.2	and in the day of salvation I helped you.”
2CO.6.2	Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation! 
2CO.6.3	We are giving no one an occasion for taking offense in anything, in order that our ministry will not have fault found with it, 
2CO.6.4	but commending ourselves as servants of God in every way, in much endurance, in afflictions, in distresses, in difficulties, 
2CO.6.5	in beatings, in prisons, in disturbances, in troubles, in sleepless nights, in going hungry, 
2CO.6.6	in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love without hypocrisy, 
2CO.6.7	in the word of truth, in the power of God, with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and left hand, 
2CO.6.8	through glory and dishonor, through slander and good repute, regarded as deceivers and yet truthful, 
2CO.6.9	as unknown and yet known completely, as dying, and behold, we go on living, as disciplined, and yet not put to death, 
2CO.6.10	as grieving, but always rejoicing, as poor, but making many rich, as having nothing, and possessing everything. 
2CO.6.11	We have spoken freely and openly
2CO.6.12	You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your affections. 
2CO.6.13	Now the same way in exchange (I am speaking as to children), you open wide your hearts also. 
2CO.6.14	Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers, for what participation is there between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? 
2CO.6.15	And what agreement does Christ have with Beliar? Or what share does a believer have with an unbeliever? 
2CO.6.16	And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said, 
2CO.6.16	“I will live in
2CO.6.16	and I will be their God and they will be my people.”
2CO.6.17	Therefore “come out from their midst 
2CO.6.17	and be separate,” says the Lord, 
2CO.6.17	“and do not touch what is unclean,
2CO.6.17	and I will welcome you,
2CO.6.18	and I will be a father to you, 
2CO.6.18	and you will be sons and daughters to me,”
2CO.6.18	says the all-powerful Lord. 
2CO.7.1	 Therefore since we
2CO.7.2	Make room for us in your hearts
2CO.7.3	I do not say this to condemn you
2CO.7.4	Great is my confidence toward you; great is my boasting on your behalf; I am filled with encouragement; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction. 
2CO.7.5	For even when
2CO.7.6	But God, who comforts the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus, 
2CO.7.7	and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted among you, because he
2CO.7.8	For if indeed I grieved you by my letter, I do not regret it. Even if I did regret it (I see
2CO.7.9	now I rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you were grieved to repentance. For you were grieved according to the will of God, so that you suffered loss in no way through us. 
2CO.7.10	For grief according to the will of God brings about a repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted, but worldly grief brings about death. 
2CO.7.11	For behold how much diligence this very thing, being grieved according to the will of God, has brought about in you: what defense of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! In everything you have demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in this matter. 
2CO.7.12	Consequently, even if I wrote to you, it was not because of the one who did wrong or because of the one who had been wronged, but in order that your diligence on our behalf
2CO.7.13	Because of this we have been encouraged, and in addition to our encouragement, we rejoiced much more over the joy of Titus, because his spirit had been refreshed by all of you. 
2CO.7.14	For if I have boasted anything to him about you, I have not been put to shame, but as I have spoken everything to you in truth, thus also our boasting to Titus has proven to be true
2CO.7.15	And his affection for you is all the more when he
2CO.7.16	I rejoice, because in everything I am completely confident in you. 
2CO.8.1	 Now we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia, 
2CO.8.2	that with a great ordeal of affliction, the abundance of their joy and the extreme depth of their poverty have overflowed to the wealth of their generosity. 
2CO.8.3	I testify that they gave
2CO.8.4	requesting of us with much exhortation the favor and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints, 
2CO.8.5	and not just as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us, by the will of God. 
2CO.8.6	So we urged Titus that, just as he had previously begun it, thus he would also complete for you this act of grace. 
2CO.8.7	But just as you excel in everything—in faith and in speaking and in knowledge and with all diligence and in the love from us that is in you—so may you excel in this grace also. 
2CO.8.8	I am not saying this as a command, but proving the genuineness of your love by means of the diligence of others. 
2CO.8.9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he
2CO.8.10	And I am giving an opinion in this matter, because this is profitable for you who not only began previously, a year ago, to do something, but also to want to do it. 
2CO.8.11	So now also complete the doing of it, in order that just as you have the eagerness to want to do it, thus also you may complete it from what you have. 
2CO.8.12	For if the eagerness is present according to what one has
2CO.8.13	For this is not that for others there may be relief, and for you difficult circumstances, but as a matter of equality. 
2CO.8.14	At the present time your abundance will be for their need, in order that their abundance may also be for your need, so that there may be equality, 
2CO.8.15	just as it is written, “The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.”
2CO.8.16	But thanks be to God, who has put in the heart of Titus the same devotion on your behalf
2CO.8.17	because he not only welcomed our request, but being very earnest, by his own choice he went out
2CO.8.18	And we have sent at the same time with him the brother whose praise in the gospel has become known throughout all the churches. 
2CO.8.19	And not only this, but he was also chosen by the churches as our traveling companion together with this gift that is being administered by us to the glory of the Lord himself and to show our readiness to help. 
2CO.8.20	We are trying to avoid this, lest anyone should find fault with us in this abundant gift that is being administered by us. 
2CO.8.21	For we are taking into consideration what is honorable not only before the Lord, but also before people. 
2CO.8.22	And we are sending with them our brother whom we have tested many times in many things that he is diligent, but now much more diligent because of his great confidence in you. 
2CO.8.23	If there is a question concerning Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. If there is a question concerning our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ. 
2CO.8.24	Therefore show to them the proof of your love and our boasting about you openly before
2CO.9.1	 For it is unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the ministry to the saints, 
2CO.9.2	because I know your readiness to help, concerning which I keep on boasting to the Macedonians about you, that Achaia has been ready to help since last year, and your zeal has stirred up the majority of them. 
2CO.9.3	But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you would not prove to be empty in this case, so that you may be prepared just as I was saying, 
2CO.9.4	lest somehow if Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to speak of you
2CO.9.5	Therefore I considered it necessary to urge the brothers that they should go on ahead to you and make arrangements in advance for your generous gift that was promised previously, so this would be prepared as a generous gift and not as grudgingly granted. 
2CO.9.6	Now the point is this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. 
2CO.9.7	Each one should give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly
2CO.9.8	And God is able to cause all grace to abound to you, so that in everything at all times, because you
2CO.9.9	Just as it is written, 
2CO.9.9	“He scattered widely, he gave to the poor; 
2CO.9.9	his righteousness remains forever
2CO.9.10	Now the one who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your seed, and will cause the harvest of your righteousness to grow, 
2CO.9.11	being made rich in every way for all generosity, which is producing through us thanksgiving to God, 
2CO.9.12	because the service of this ministry is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but also is overflowing through many expressions of thanksgiving to God. 
2CO.9.13	Through the proven character of this service they will glorify God because of the submission of your confession to the gospel of Christ and the generosity of your participation toward them and toward everyone, 
2CO.9.14	and they are longing for you in their prayers for you, because of the surpassing grace of God to you. 
2CO.9.15	Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift! 
2CO.10.1	 Now I, Paul, appeal to you myself by the humility and gentleness of Christ, who when I am present in person
2CO.10.2	now I ask when I
2CO.10.3	For although we
2CO.10.4	for the weapons of our warfare are not merely human, but powerful to God for the tearing down of fortresses, tearing down arguments 
2CO.10.5	and all pride that is raised up against the knowledge of God, and taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ. 
2CO.10.6	And we are ready
2CO.10.7	You are looking at things according to appearance. If anyone is convinced he himself is Christ’s, he should consider this concerning himself again: that just as Christ himself is, so also are we. 
2CO.10.8	For even if I boast somewhat more about our authority that the Lord gave us for building you up and not for tearing you down
2CO.10.9	so that I do not want to appear as if I were terrifying you by my letters, 
2CO.10.10	because it is said, “His letters are severe and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak and his speech is of no account.” 
2CO.10.11	Let such a person consider this: that what we are in word by letters when we
2CO.10.12	For we do not dare to classify or to compare ourselves with some who commend themselves, but they themselves, when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, do not understand. 
2CO.10.13	But we will not boast beyond limits
2CO.10.14	For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we
2CO.10.15	not boasting beyond limits
2CO.10.16	so that we may proclaim the gospel in the regions that lie beyond you, and not boast in the things accomplished in the area assigned to someone else. 
2CO.10.17	But “the one who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”
2CO.10.18	For it is not the one commending himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends. 
2CO.11.1	 I wish that you would put up with me in something a little foolish
2CO.11.2	For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy, because I promised you in marriage to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. 
2CO.11.3	But I am afraid lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds may be led astray from the sincerity and the purity of devotion to Christ. 
2CO.11.4	For if the one who comes proclaims another Jesus whom we have not proclaimed, or you receive a different spirit which you did not receive, or a different gospel which you did not accept, you put up with it well enough! 
2CO.11.5	For I consider myself in no way to be inferior to the preeminent apostles.
2CO.11.6	But even if I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not in knowledge; certainly in everything we have made this clear to you in every way. 
2CO.11.7	Or did I commit a sin by
2CO.11.8	I robbed other churches by
2CO.11.9	And when I
2CO.11.10	As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine
2CO.11.11	Why
2CO.11.12	But what I am doing, I will also do, in order that I may remove the opportunity of those who want an opportunity, that they may be found just as also we are in what they are boasting about. 
2CO.11.13	For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 
2CO.11.14	And no wonder, for Satan himself disguises himself as an angel of light. 
2CO.11.15	Therefore it is not a great thing if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds. 
2CO.11.16	Again I say, do not let anyone think I am foolish. But indeed, if you do, accept me even as foolish, in order that I also may boast a little. 
2CO.11.17	What I am saying in this project of boasting, I am not saying as the Lord would say, but as in foolishness. 
2CO.11.18	Since many are boasting according to human standards, I also will boast. 
2CO.11.19	For because you
2CO.11.20	For you put up with it if someone enslaves you, if someone devours you, if someone takes advantage of you, if someone is presumptious toward you, if someone strikes you in the face. 
2CO.11.21	I say this to my shame, namely, that we have been weak. 
2CO.11.21	But in whatever anyone dares to boast—I am speaking in foolishness—I also dare to boast. 
2CO.11.22	Are they Hebrews? I am also! Are they Israelites? I am also! Are they descendants of Abraham? I am also! 
2CO.11.23	Are they servants of Christ?—I am speaking as though I were beside myself—I am more so, with far greater labors, with far more imprisonments, with beatings to a much greater degree, in danger of death many times. 
2CO.11.24	Five times I received at the hands of the Jews forty lashes less one. 
2CO.11.25	Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I received a stoning. Three times I was shipwrecked. A day and a night I have spent in the deep water. 
2CO.11.26	I have been on journeys many times, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own people, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers because of false brothers, 
2CO.11.27	with toil and hardship, often in sleepless nights, with hunger and thirst, often going hungry, in cold and poorly clothed. 
2CO.11.28	Apart from these external things, there is the pressure on me every day of the anxiety about all the churches. 
2CO.11.29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to sin, and I do not burn with indignation? 
2CO.11.30	If it is necessary to boast, I will boast about the things related to my weakness
2CO.11.31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is blessed forever
2CO.11.32	In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to take me into custody, 
2CO.11.33	and I was lowered through a window through the wall in a rope-basket, and I escaped his hands. 
2CO.12.1	 It is necessary to boast; it is not profitable, but I will proceed to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
2CO.12.2	I know a man in Christ fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven, 
2CO.12.3	and I know this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows—
2CO.12.4	that he was caught up to paradise and heard words not to be spoken, which it is not permitted for a person to speak. 
2CO.12.5	On behalf of such a person I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses. 
2CO.12.6	For if I want to boast, I will not be foolish, because I will be telling the truth, but I am refraining, so that no one can credit to me more than what he sees in me or hears anything from me, 
2CO.12.7	even because of the extraordinary degree of the revelations. Therefore, so that I would not exalt myself, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan, in order that it would torment me so that I would not exalt myself. 
2CO.12.8	Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would depart from me. 
2CO.12.9	And he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, because the
2CO.12.10	Therefore I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in calamities, in persecutions and difficulties for the sake of Christ, for whenever I am weak, then I am strong. 
2CO.12.11	I have become a fool! You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for I am in no way inferior to the preeminent apostles,
2CO.12.12	Indeed, the signs of an apostle have been done among you with all patient endurance, both signs and wonders and deeds of power. 
2CO.12.13	For in what respect are you made worse off
2CO.12.14	Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you. For I am not seeking your possessions, but you. For children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. 
2CO.12.15	But I will spend and be expended most gladly for your lives. If I love you much more, am I to be loved less? 
2CO.12.16	But let it be. I have not been a burden to you, but because I
2CO.12.17	I have not taken advantage of you through anyone whom I sent to you
2CO.12.18	I urged Titus to go, and I sent the brother with him. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he?
2CO.12.19	Have you been thinking all this time that we are defending ourselves to you? We are speaking in Christ before God, and all these things, dear friends, are for your edification. 
2CO.12.20	For I am afraid lest somehow when I
2CO.12.21	I am afraid lest when I
2CO.13.1	 This is the third time I am coming to you. By the testimony
2CO.13.2	I have already said when I was present the second time, and although I
2CO.13.3	since you are demanding proof that Christ, who is not weak toward you, but is powerful among you, is speaking in me. 
2CO.13.4	For indeed, he was crucified because of weakness, but he lives because of the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we will live together with him because of the power of God toward you. 
2CO.13.5	Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith. Examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize regarding yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are unqualified? 
2CO.13.6	And I hope that you will recognize that we are not unqualified! 
2CO.13.7	Now we pray to God that you not do wrong in any way, not that we are seen as approved, but that you do what is good, even though we are seen as though unqualified. 
2CO.13.8	For we are not able to do anything against the truth, but rather only for the truth. 
2CO.13.9	For we rejoice whenever we are weak, but you are strong, and we pray for this: your maturity. 
2CO.13.10	Because of this, I am writing these things although I
2CO.13.11	Finally, brothers, rejoice, be restored, be encouraged, be in agreement
2CO.13.12	Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the saints greet you. 
2CO.13.13	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you. 
GAL.1.1	 Paul, an apostle not from men nor by men but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead, 
GAL.1.2	and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia. 
GAL.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,
GAL.1.4	who gave himself for our sins in order to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, 
GAL.1.5	to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. 
GAL.1.6	I am astonished that you are turning away so quickly from the one who called you by the grace of Christ to a different gospel, 
GAL.1.7	not that there is a different gospel, except there are some who are disturbing you and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ. 
GAL.1.8	But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim a gospel to you contrary to what we proclaimed to you, let him be accursed! 
GAL.1.9	As we said before, and now I say again, if anyone is proclaiming a gospel to you contrary to what you have received, let him be accursed! 
GAL.1.10	For am I now making an appeal to people or to God? Or am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ. 
GAL.1.11	For I make known to you, brothers, the gospel that has been proclaimed by me, that it is not of human origin
GAL.1.12	For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. 
GAL.1.13	For you have heard about my former way of life in Judaism, that to an extraordinary degree I was persecuting the church of God, and trying to destroy it, 
GAL.1.14	and was progressing in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my nation, because
GAL.1.15	But when the one who set me apart
GAL.1.16	to reveal his Son in me in order that I would proclaim the gospel about him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not consult with flesh and blood, 
GAL.1.17	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia and I returned again to Damascus. 
GAL.1.18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days, 
GAL.1.19	but I did not see any others of the apostles except James, the brother of the Lord. 
GAL.1.20	(Now the things which I am writing to you, behold, I assure you before God that I am not lying.) 
GAL.1.21	Then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia, 
GAL.1.22	but I was unknown in person
GAL.1.23	and they were only hearing, “The one formerly persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith that formerly he was attempting to destroy,” 
GAL.1.24	and they were glorifying God because of me. 
GAL.2.1	 Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking along Titus also. 
GAL.2.2	Now I went up there because of a revelation and laid out to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles, but in private to the influential people, lest somehow I was running, or had run, in vain. 
GAL.2.3	But not even Titus who was with me, although
GAL.2.4	Now this was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, in order that they might enslave us, 
GAL.2.5	to whom not even for an hour did we yield in subjection, in order that the truth of the gospel might remain continually with you. 
GAL.2.6	But from those who were influential
GAL.2.7	But these, when they
GAL.2.8	(for the one who was at work through Peter for his apostleship to the circumcision was at work also through me for the Gentiles), 
GAL.2.9	and when James and Cephas and John—those thought to be pillars—acknowledged the grace given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, in order that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision. 
GAL.2.10	They asked only that we should remember the poor, the very thing I was also eager to do. 
GAL.2.11	But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was condemned. 
GAL.2.12	For before certain people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles, but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, because he
GAL.2.13	and the rest of the Jews also joined in this hypocrisy with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with them in their hypocrisy. 
GAL.2.14	But when I saw that they were not being straightforward with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of them all, “If you, although you
GAL.2.15	We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles, 
GAL.2.16	but knowing that a person is not justified by the works of the law, if not by faith in Jesus Christ,
GAL.2.17	But if while seeking to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also have been found to be sinners, then is Christ an agent of sin? May it never be! 
GAL.2.18	For if I build up again these things which I destroyed, I show myself to be a transgressor. 
GAL.2.19	For through the law I died to the law, in order that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ, 
GAL.2.20	and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me, and that life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. 
GAL.2.21	I do not declare invalid the grace of God, for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died to no purpose. 
GAL.3.1	 O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as having been crucified? 
GAL.3.2	I want only to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
GAL.3.3	Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now trying to be made complete by the flesh? 
GAL.3.4	Have you suffered so many things for nothing—if indeed also it was for nothing? 
GAL.3.5	Therefore does the one who gives you the Spirit and who works miracles among you do so by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
GAL.3.6	Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness, 
GAL.3.7	then understand that the ones who have faith
GAL.3.8	And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the good news in advance to Abraham: “In you all the nations
GAL.3.9	So then, the ones who have faith are blessed together with Abraham who believed. 
GAL.3.10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse, for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the things that are written in the book of the law to do them.”
GAL.3.11	Now it is clear that no one is justified in the sight of God by the law, because “the one who is righteous will live by faith.”
GAL.3.12	But the law is not from faith, but “the one who does these things will live by them.”
GAL.3.13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by
GAL.3.14	in order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 
GAL.3.15	Brothers, I am speaking according to a human perspective. Nevertheless, when
GAL.3.16	Now to Abraham and to his descendant the promises were spoken. It does not say, “and to descendants,” as concerning many, but as concerning one, “and to your descendant,”
GAL.3.17	Now I am saying this: the law, that came after four hundred and thirty years, does not revoke a covenant previously ratified by God, in order to nullify the promise. 
GAL.3.18	For if the inheritance is from the law, it is no longer from the promise, but God graciously gave it to Abraham through the promise. 
GAL.3.19	Why then the law? It was added on account of transgressions, until the descendant should come to whom it had been promised, having been ordered through angels by the hand of a mediator. 
GAL.3.20	Now the mediator is not for one, but God is one. 
GAL.3.21	Therefore is the law opposed to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, certainly righteousness would have been from the law. 
GAL.3.22	But the scripture imprisoned all under sin, in order that the promise could be given by faith
GAL.3.23	But before faith came, we were detained under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith was revealed. 
GAL.3.24	So then, the law became our guardian until Christ, in order that we could be justified by faith. 
GAL.3.25	But after
GAL.3.26	For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus,
GAL.3.27	for as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 
GAL.3.28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 
GAL.3.29	And if you are Christ’s, then you are descendants of Abraham, heirs according to the promise. 
GAL.4.1	 Now I say, for as long a time as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he
GAL.4.2	but he is under guardians and managers until the time set by his father. 
GAL.4.3	So also we, when we were children, we were enslaved under the elemental spirits of the world. 
GAL.4.4	But when the fullness of time came, God sent out his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, 
GAL.4.5	in order that he might redeem those under the law, in order that we might receive the adoption. 
GAL.4.6	And because you are sons, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying out, “Abba!
GAL.4.7	so that you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, also an heir through God. 
GAL.4.8	But at that time when you
GAL.4.9	But now, because you have come to know God, or rather have come to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental spirits? Do you want to be enslaved to them
GAL.4.10	You carefully observe days and months and seasons and years. 
GAL.4.11	I am afraid for you, lest perhaps I have labored for you in vain! 
GAL.4.12	I ask you, brothers, become like me, because I also have become like you. You have done me no wrong! 
GAL.4.13	But you know that because of an illness of the flesh I proclaimed the gospel to you the first time. 
GAL.4.14	And you did not despise or disdain what was a trial for you in my flesh, but you welcomed me like an angel of God, like Christ Jesus. 
GAL.4.15	So where is your blessing? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me! 
GAL.4.16	So then, have I become your enemy by
GAL.4.17	They zealously seek you, not commendably, but they want to exclude you, in order that you may seek them zealously. 
GAL.4.18	But it is good to be sought zealously in good at all times, and not only when I am present with you. 
GAL.4.19	My children, for whom I am having birth pains again, until Christ is formed in you! 
GAL.4.20	But I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone because I am perplexed about you. 
GAL.4.21	Tell me, you who are wanting to be under the law, do you not understand
GAL.4.22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the female slave and one by the free woman. 
GAL.4.23	But the one by the female slave was born according to human descent, and the one by the free woman through the promise, 
GAL.4.24	which things are spoken allegorically, for these women are two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery, who is Hagar. 
GAL.4.25	Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is a slave with her children. 
GAL.4.26	But the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother. 
GAL.4.27	For it is written, 
GAL.4.27	“Rejoice, O barren woman, who does not give birth to children; 
GAL.4.27	burst out and shout, you who do not have birth pains, 
GAL.4.27	because many are the children of the desolate woman, 
GAL.4.27	even more than those of the one who has a husband.”
GAL.4.28	But you, brothers, are children of the promise, just as Isaac. 
GAL.4.29	But just as at that time the child born according to human descent persecuted the child born according to the Spirit, so also now. 
GAL.4.30	But what does the scripture say? “Drive out the female slave and her son, for the son of the female slave will never inherit with the son”
GAL.4.31	Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the female slave but of the free woman. 
GAL.5.1	 For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery. 
GAL.5.2	Look! I, Paul, tell you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing! 
GAL.5.3	And again I testify to every man who becomes circumcised, that he is under obligation to keep the whole law. 
GAL.5.4	You are estranged from Christ, you who are attempting to be justified
GAL.5.5	For through the Spirit by faith we eagerly await the hope of righteousness. 
GAL.5.6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love. 
GAL.5.7	You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? 
GAL.5.8	This persuasion is not from the one who calls you! 
GAL.5.9	A little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough. 
GAL.5.10	I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will think nothing different, but the one who is confusing you will pay the penalty
GAL.5.11	Now, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished. 
GAL.5.12	I wish that the ones who are disturbing you would also castrate themselves
GAL.5.13	For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not let your freedom become an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. 
GAL.5.14	For the whole law is fulfilled in one statement, namely, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
GAL.5.15	But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another. 
GAL.5.16	But I say, live by the Spirit, and you will never carry out the desire of the flesh. 
GAL.5.17	For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, for these are in opposition to one another, so that whatever you want, you may not do these things. 
GAL.5.18	But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 
GAL.5.19	Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are sexual immorality, impurity, licentiousness, 
GAL.5.20	idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, factions, 
GAL.5.21	envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, things which I am telling you in advance, just as I said before, that the ones who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 
GAL.5.22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
GAL.5.23	gentleness, self control. Against such things there is no law. 
GAL.5.24	Now those who belong to Christ
GAL.5.25	If we live by the Spirit, we must also follow the Spirit. 
GAL.5.26	We must not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another. 
GAL.6.1	 Brothers, even if a person is caught in some trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a person in a spirit of humility, looking out for yourself, lest you also be tempted. 
GAL.6.2	Carry the burdens of one another, and so fulfill the law of Christ. 
GAL.6.3	For if anyone thinks he is something although he
GAL.6.4	But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have a reason for boasting in himself alone, and not in someone else. 
GAL.6.5	For each one will carry his own burden. 
GAL.6.6	Now the one who is taught the word must share in all good things with the one who teaches. 
GAL.6.7	Do not be deceived: God is not to be mocked, for whatever a person sows, this he will also reap, 
GAL.6.8	because the one who sows to his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit. 
GAL.6.9	And let us not grow weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap, if we
GAL.6.10	So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who belong to the household of faith. 
GAL.6.11	See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand. 
GAL.6.12	As many as are wanting to make a good showing in the flesh, these are attempting to compel
GAL.6.13	For not even those who are circumcised observe the law themselves, but they want you to be circumcised in order that they may boast in your flesh. 
GAL.6.14	But as for me, may it never be that I boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 
GAL.6.15	For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. 
GAL.6.16	And all those who follow this rule, peace and mercy be on them and on the Israel of God. 
GAL.6.17	Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I carry on my body the marks of Jesus. 
GAL.6.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen. 
EPH.1.1	 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus
EPH.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
EPH.1.3	Blessed is
EPH.1.4	just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love,
EPH.1.5	having predestined us to adoption through Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will, 
EPH.1.6	to the praise of the glory of his grace that he bestowed on us in the beloved, 
EPH.1.7	in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace, 
EPH.1.8	that he caused to abound to us in all wisdom and insight, 
EPH.1.9	making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he purposed in him, 
EPH.1.10	for the administration of the fullness of times, to bring together all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in him 
EPH.1.11	in whom also we were chosen, having been predestined according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of his will, 
EPH.1.12	that we who hoped beforehand in Christ should be for the praise of his glory, 
EPH.1.13	in whom also you, when you heard
EPH.1.14	who is the down payment of our inheritance, until the redemption of the possession, to the praise of his glory. 
EPH.1.15	Because of this I also, hearing of your faith
EPH.1.16	do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention in my prayers, 
EPH.1.17	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father
EPH.1.18	(the eyes of your hearts having been enlightened), so that you may know what is the hope of his calling, what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance among the saints, 
EPH.1.19	and what is the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his mighty strength 
EPH.1.20	which he has worked
EPH.1.21	above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name named, not only in this age but also in the coming one, 
EPH.1.22	and he subjected all things under his feet
EPH.1.23	which is his body, the fullness of the one who fills all things in every way. 
EPH.2.1	 And you, although you were dead
EPH.2.2	in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit now working in the sons of disobedience, 
EPH.2.3	among whom also we all formerly lived in the desires of our flesh, doing the will
EPH.2.4	But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us, 
EPH.2.5	and we being dead in trespasses, he made us alive together with Christ (by grace you are saved), 
EPH.2.6	and raised us together and seated us together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 
EPH.2.7	in order that he might show in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness upon us in Christ Jesus. 
EPH.2.8	For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; 
EPH.2.9	it is not from works, so that no one can boast. 
EPH.2.10	For we are his creation, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, so that we may walk in them. 
EPH.2.11	Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, the so-called uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision in the flesh, made by hands, 
EPH.2.12	that you were at that time apart from Christ, alienated from the citizenship of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, not having hope, and without God in the world. 
EPH.2.13	But now in Christ Jesus you, the ones who once were far away, have become near by the blood of Christ. 
EPH.2.14	For he himself is our peace, who made both one and broke down the dividing wall of the partition, the enmity, in his flesh, 
EPH.2.15	invalidating the law of commandments in ordinances, in order that he might create the two in himself into one new man, thus
EPH.2.16	and might reconcile both in one body to God through the cross, killing the enmity in himself.
EPH.2.17	And coming, he proclaimed the good news of peace to you who were far away and peace to the ones who were near, 
EPH.2.18	because through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. 
EPH.2.19	Consequently, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens of the saints and members of the household of God, 
EPH.2.20	built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone,
EPH.2.21	in whom the whole building, joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, 
EPH.2.22	in whom you also are built up together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.
EPH.3.1	 On account of this I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles 
EPH.3.2	—if indeed you have heard about the stewardship of God’s grace given to me for you. 
EPH.3.3	According to
EPH.3.4	so that you may be able when you read
EPH.3.5	(which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit): 
EPH.3.6	that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow sharers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, 
EPH.3.7	of which I became a servant, according to the gift of God’s grace given to me, according to the working of his power. 
EPH.3.8	To me, the least of all the saints, was given this grace: to proclaim the good news of the fathomless riches of Christ to the Gentiles, 
EPH.3.9	and to enlighten everyone as to what is the administration of the mystery hidden from the ages by God, who created all things, 
EPH.3.10	in order that the many-sided wisdom of God might be made known now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places through the church, 
EPH.3.11	according to the purpose of the ages which he carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, 
EPH.3.12	in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through faith in him.
EPH.3.13	Therefore I ask you
EPH.3.14	On account of this, I bend my knees before the Father, 
EPH.3.15	from whom every
EPH.3.16	that he may grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner person, 
EPH.3.17	that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith (you having been firmly rooted and established in love), 
EPH.3.18	in order that you may be strong enough to grasp together with all the saints what is the breadth, and length, and height, and depth, 
EPH.3.19	and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, in order that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God. 
EPH.3.20	Now to the one who is able to do beyond all measure more than all that we ask or think, according to the power that is at work in us, 
EPH.3.21	to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen. 
EPH.4.1	 Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you to live in a manner worthy of the calling with which you were called: 
EPH.4.2	with all humility and gentleness, with patience, putting up with one another in love, 
EPH.4.3	being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; 
EPH.4.4	one body and one Spirit (just as also you were called with one hope of your calling), 
EPH.4.5	one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
EPH.4.6	one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all. 
EPH.4.7	Now to each one of us was given this grace, according to the measure of Christ’s gift. 
EPH.4.8	Therefore it says, 
EPH.4.8	“Ascending on high he led captivity captive; 
EPH.4.8	he gave gifts to men.”
EPH.4.9	Now “he ascended,” what is it, except that he also descended
EPH.4.10	The one who descended himself is also the one who ascended above all the heavens, in order that he might fill all things. 
EPH.4.11	And he himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers 
EPH.4.12	for the equipping of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for building up the body of Christ, 
EPH.4.13	until we all reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to a measure of the maturity of the fullness of Christ, 
EPH.4.14	so that we may no longer be infants, tossed about by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching, by the trickery of people, by craftiness with reference to the scheming of deceit. 
EPH.4.15	But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow into him with reference to all things, who is the head, Christ, 
EPH.4.16	from whom the whole body, joined together and held together by every supporting ligament, according to the working by measure of each single part, the growth of the body makes for the building up of itself in love. 
EPH.4.17	This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles walk: in the futility of their mind, 
EPH.4.18	being darkened in understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart, 
EPH.4.19	who, becoming callous, gave themselves over to licentiousness, for the pursuit of all uncleanness in greediness. 
EPH.4.20	But you did not learn Christ in this way, 
EPH.4.21	if indeed you have heard about him, and you were taught by him (just as truth is in Jesus), 
EPH.4.22	that you take off, according to your former way of life, the old man, who is being destroyed according to deceitful desires, 
EPH.4.23	be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 
EPH.4.24	and put on the new man (in accordance with God), who is created in righteousness and holiness from the truth. 
EPH.4.25	Therefore, putting aside the lie, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor,
EPH.4.26	Be angry and do not sin;
EPH.4.27	nor give place to the devil. 
EPH.4.28	The one who steals must steal no longer, but instead must labor, working with his own hands what is good, so that he may have something to share with the one who has need. 
EPH.4.29	No rotten word must proceed
EPH.4.30	and do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 
EPH.4.31	All bitterness, and rage, and wrath, and clamor, and abusive speech, must be removed from you, together with all wickedness. 
EPH.4.32	Become
EPH.5.1	 Therefore become imitators of God, as beloved children, 
EPH.5.2	and live in love, just as also Christ loved us, and gave himself for us an offering and sacrifice to God for a fragrant smell.
EPH.5.3	But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or greediness, must not even be named among you (as is fitting for saints), 
EPH.5.4	and obscenity, and foolish talk, or coarse jesting (which are not proper), but rather thanksgiving. 
EPH.5.5	For this you know for certain
EPH.5.6	Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience. 
EPH.5.7	Therefore do not be sharers
EPH.5.8	for you were formerly darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live like children of light 
EPH.5.9	(for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth), 
EPH.5.10	trying to learn what is well-pleasing to the Lord. 
EPH.5.11	And do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even expose them. 
EPH.5.12	For it is shameful even to speak about the things being done by them in secret, 
EPH.5.13	but all things exposed by the light are made visible, 
EPH.5.14	for everything made visible is light. Therefore it says, 
EPH.5.14	Wake up, sleeper, 
EPH.5.14	and rise from the dead, 
EPH.5.14	and Christ will shine on you.
EPH.5.15	Therefore, consider carefully how you live, not as unwise but as wise, 
EPH.5.16	making the most of the time because the days are evil. 
EPH.5.17	Because of this do not become foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. 
EPH.5.18	And do not be drunk with wine (in which is dissipation), but be filled by the Spirit, 
EPH.5.19	speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and singing praise in your heart to the Lord, 
EPH.5.20	giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to the God and Father, 
EPH.5.21	being subject to one another out of reverence for
EPH.5.22	—wives to their own husbands as to the Lord, 
EPH.5.23	because the husband is the head of the wife, as also Christ is the head of the church (he himself being the Savior of the body). 
EPH.5.24	But as the church is subject to Christ, thus also wives should be subject
EPH.5.25	Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for her; 
EPH.5.26	in order that he might sanctify her by cleansing her
EPH.5.27	in order that he might present to himself the church glorious, not having a spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she may be holy and blameless. 
EPH.5.28	Thus also husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. The one who loves his own wife loves himself. 
EPH.5.29	For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as also Christ does the church, 
EPH.5.30	because we are members of his body. 
EPH.5.31	“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”
EPH.5.32	(This mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.) 
EPH.5.33	Only you also, each one of you, must thus love his own wife as himself, and the wife must respect
EPH.6.1	 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 
EPH.6.2	“Honor your father and mother” (which is the first
EPH.6.3	“in order that it may be well with you, and you may live a long time
EPH.6.4	And fathers, do not make your children angry, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. 
EPH.6.5	Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ, 
EPH.6.6	not while being watched
EPH.6.7	serving with goodwill as to the Lord and not to people, 
EPH.6.8	because you
EPH.6.9	And masters, do the same things to them, giving up threats, knowing that both their Lord and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him. 
EPH.6.10	Finally, become strong in the Lord and in the might of his strength. 
EPH.6.11	Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil, 
EPH.6.12	because our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. 
EPH.6.13	Because of this, take up the full armor of God, in order that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand. 
EPH.6.14	Stand therefore, girding your waist with truth, and putting on the breastplate of righteousness, 
EPH.6.15	and binding shoes under your feet with the preparation of the good news of peace, 
EPH.6.16	in everything taking up the shield of faith, with which you are able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one, 
EPH.6.17	and receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, 
EPH.6.18	with all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the Spirit, and to this end being alert with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints, 
EPH.6.19	and for me, that a word may be given to me at the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, 
EPH.6.20	for the sake of which I am an ambassador in chains, that in them
EPH.6.21	Now, so that you also may know my circumstances
EPH.6.22	whom I have sent
EPH.6.23	Peace to the brothers and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
EPH.6.24	Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility.
PHP.1.1	 Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons. 
PHP.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
PHP.1.3	I give thanks to my God upon my every remembrance of you,
PHP.1.4	always in my every prayer for all of you, making the prayer with joy, 
PHP.1.5	because of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now, 
PHP.1.6	convinced of this same thing, that the one who began a good work in you will finish it
PHP.1.7	just as it is right for me to think this about all of you, because I have you in my heart, since
PHP.1.8	For God is my witness, that I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. 
PHP.1.9	And this I pray: that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment, 
PHP.1.10	so that you may approve what is superior, in order that you may be sincere and blameless in
PHP.1.11	having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God. 
PHP.1.12	Now I want you to know, brothers, that my circumstances
PHP.1.13	so that my imprisonment in Christ has become known in the whole praetorium
PHP.1.14	and most of the brothers, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, dare even more to speak the word without fear. 
PHP.1.15	Some even because of envy and strife preach Christ, but some also because of good will. 
PHP.1.16	The latter do so from love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. 
PHP.1.17	The former proclaim Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction in my imprisonment. 
PHP.1.18	What is the result?
PHP.1.19	for I know that this will turn out to me for deliverance through your prayer and the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
PHP.1.20	according to my eager expectation and hope, that I will be put to shame in nothing, but with all boldness, even now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether through life or through death. 
PHP.1.21	For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain. 
PHP.1.22	But if it is to live in the flesh, this is fruitful work for me, and which I will prefer I do not know. 
PHP.1.23	But I am hard pressed between the two options
PHP.1.24	But to stay on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake. 
PHP.1.25	And because I am
PHP.1.26	so that what you can be proud of may increase in Christ Jesus because of me through my return again to you. 
PHP.1.27	Only lead your lives in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent I hear your circumstances
PHP.1.28	and not letting yourselves be intimidated in anything by your opponents, which is a sign of destruction to them, but of your salvation, and this from God, 
PHP.1.29	because to you has been graciously granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on behalf of him, 
PHP.1.30	having the same struggle which you saw in me and now hear about in me. 
PHP.2.1	 Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, 
PHP.2.2	complete my joy, so that you are in agreement
PHP.2.3	Do nothing according to selfish ambition or according to empty conceit, but in humility considering one another better than yourselves, 
PHP.2.4	each of you
PHP.2.5	Think this in
PHP.2.6	who, existing in the form of God, 
PHP.2.6	did not consider being equal with God something to be grasped, 
PHP.2.7	but emptied himself 
PHP.2.7	by
PHP.2.7	by
PHP.2.7	And being found in appearance like a man, 
PHP.2.8	he humbled himself 
PHP.2.8	by
PHP.2.8	that is, death on a cross. 
PHP.2.9	Therefore also God exalted him 
PHP.2.9	and graciously granted him the name above every name, 
PHP.2.10	so that at the name of Jesus 
PHP.2.10	every knee should bow, 
PHP.2.10	of those in heaven and of those on earth and of those under the earth, 
PHP.2.11	and every tongue confess 
PHP.2.11	that Jesus Christ is Lord, 
PHP.2.11	to the glory of God the Father. 
PHP.2.12	Therefore my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. 
PHP.2.13	For the one at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure, is God. 
PHP.2.14	Do all things without grumbling and disputing, 
PHP.2.15	in order that you may become blameless and innocent, children of God without fault
PHP.2.16	holding fast to the word of life, for a source of pride
PHP.2.17	But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and rejoice with all of you. 
PHP.2.18	And in the same way also you rejoice and rejoice with me. 
PHP.2.19	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I also may be encouraged when I
PHP.2.20	For I have no one like-minded who will sincerely be concerned about your circumstances
PHP.2.21	For they all seek their own interests
PHP.2.22	But you know his proven character, that like a child with a father he served with me for the gospel. 
PHP.2.23	Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see my circumstances
PHP.2.24	And I am convinced in the Lord that I myself will arrive shortly also. 
PHP.2.25	But I considered it
PHP.2.26	because he was longing for all of you and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick. 
PHP.2.27	For indeed he was sick, coming near to death, but God had mercy on him and not on him only, but also on me, so that I would not have grief upon grief. 
PHP.2.28	Therefore I am sending him with special urgency, in order that when
PHP.2.29	Therefore welcome him in the Lord with all joy, and consider such people highly honored, 
PHP.2.30	because on account of the work of Christ he came near to the point of death, risking his life in order that he might make up for your inability to serve me
PHP.3.1	 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is not troublesome to me, but is a safeguard for you. 
PHP.3.2	Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the mutilation.
PHP.3.3	For we are the circumcision, the ones who worship
PHP.3.4	although I could have confidence even in the flesh. 
PHP.3.4	If anyone else thinks to put confidence in the flesh, I can do so more: 
PHP.3.5	circumcised on the eighth day
PHP.3.6	according to zeal persecuting the church, according to the righteousness in the law being blameless. 
PHP.3.7	But whatever things were gain to me, these things I have considered loss because of Christ. 
PHP.3.8	More than that
PHP.3.9	and may be found in him, not having my righteousness which is from the law, but which is through faith in Christ,
PHP.3.10	so that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death, 
PHP.3.11	if somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. 
PHP.3.12	Not that I have already received this,
PHP.3.13	Brothers, I do not consider myself to have laid hold of it.
PHP.3.14	I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 
PHP.3.15	Therefore as many as are perfect, let us hold this opinion
PHP.3.16	Only to what we have attained, to the same hold on. 
PHP.3.17	Become fellow imitators of me, brothers, and observe those who walk in this way, just as you have us as an example. 
PHP.3.18	For many live, of whom I spoke about to you many times, but now speak about even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ, 
PHP.3.19	whose end is destruction, whose God is the stomach, and whose glory is in their shame, the ones who think on earthly things. 
PHP.3.20	For our commonwealth exists in heaven, from which also we eagerly await a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, 
PHP.3.21	who will transform our humble body to be conformed to his glorious body, in accordance with the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself. 
PHP.4.1	 So then, my beloved and greatly desired brothers, my joy and crown, thus stand firm in the Lord, dear friends. 
PHP.4.2	I appeal to Euodia and I appeal to Syntyche to be in agreement
PHP.4.3	Yes, I ask also you, true yokefellow, help them, who struggled along with me in the gospel with both Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life. 
PHP.4.4	Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice. 
PHP.4.5	Let your gentleness be made known to all people. The Lord is near. 
PHP.4.6	Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. 
PHP.4.7	And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds
PHP.4.8	Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are right, whatever things are pure, whatever things are pleasing, whatever things are commendable, if there is any excellence of character and if anything praiseworthy, think about these things. 
PHP.4.9	And the things which you have learned and received and heard about and seen in me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you. 
PHP.4.10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last you have renewed your concern for me
PHP.4.11	Not that I speak from need, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am. 
PHP.4.12	I know how both to make do with little
PHP.4.13	I am able to do all things by the one who strengthens me. 
PHP.4.14	Nevertheless you have done well by sharing
PHP.4.15	Now you also know, Philippians, that at the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone, 
PHP.4.16	because even in Thessalonica on more than one occasion
PHP.4.17	Not that I seek the gift, but I seek for the profit that increases to your account. 
PHP.4.18	But I have received everything in full and have an abundance; I am well supplied
PHP.4.19	And my God will fulfill your every need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 
PHP.4.20	Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever
PHP.4.21	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers with me greet you. 
PHP.4.22	All the saints greet you, and especially those of Caesar’s household. 
PHP.4.23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. 
COL.1.1	 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, 
COL.1.2	to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ in Colossae. Grace to you and peace from God our Father. 
COL.1.3	We give thanks always to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ when we
COL.1.4	since we
COL.1.5	because of the hope reserved for you in heaven, which you have heard about beforehand in the word of truth, the gospel, 
COL.1.6	that has come to you, just as also in all the world it is bearing fruit and increasing, just as also among you from the day you heard about and understood the grace of God in truth, 
COL.1.7	just as you learned it
COL.1.8	who also made clear to us your love in the Spirit. 
COL.1.9	Because of this also we, from the day we heard about it,
COL.1.10	so that you may live in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please him in all respects
COL.1.11	enabled with all power, according to his glorious might, for all steadfastness and patience with joy, 
COL.1.12	giving thanks to the Father who has qualified you for a share of the inheritance of the saints in light, 
COL.1.13	who has rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us
COL.1.14	in whom we have the redemption, the forgiveness of sins, 
COL.1.15	who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all
COL.1.16	because all things in the heavens and on the earth were created by him, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers, all things were created through him and for him, 
COL.1.17	and he himself is before all things, and in him all things are held together, 
COL.1.18	and he himself is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he himself may become first in everything, 
COL.1.19	because he was well pleased for all the fullness to dwell in him, 
COL.1.20	and through him to reconcile all things to himself, by
COL.1.21	And although you were formerly alienated
COL.1.22	but now you have been reconciled
COL.1.23	if indeed you remain in the faith, established and steadfast and not shifted away from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister. 
COL.1.24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings on behalf of you, and I fill up in my flesh what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ, on behalf of his body which is the church, 
COL.1.25	of which I became a minister, according to God’s stewardship which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God, 
COL.1.26	the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but has now been revealed to his saints, 
COL.1.27	to whom God wanted to make known what is the glorious wealth of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory, 
COL.1.28	whom we proclaim, by
COL.1.29	for which purpose also I labor, striving according to his working which is at work powerfully in me. 
COL.2.1	 For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on behalf of you, and those in Laodicea, and all those who have not seen my face in person
COL.2.2	so that their hearts may be encouraged, united in love and into all the wealth of the full assurance of insight into the knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ, 
COL.2.3	in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden. 
COL.2.4	I say this in order that no one will deceive you with persuasive speech, 
COL.2.5	for even if I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing and seeing your good order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. 
COL.2.6	Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, live in him, 
COL.2.7	firmly rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding with thankfulness. 
COL.2.8	Beware lest anyone take you captive
COL.2.9	because in him all the fullness of deity dwells bodily, 
COL.2.10	and you are filled in him, who is the head over every ruler and authority, 
COL.2.11	in whom also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made by hands, by the removal of the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, 
COL.2.12	having been buried with him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. 
COL.2.13	And although you were dead
COL.2.14	having destroyed the certificate of indebtedness in ordinances against us, which was hostile to us, and removed it out of the way by
COL.2.15	When he
COL.2.16	Therefore do not let anyone judge you with reference to eating or
COL.2.17	which are a shadow of what is to come, but the reality is Christ. 
COL.2.18	Let no one condemn you, taking pleasure in humility and the worship of angels, going into detail about the things which he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind, 
COL.2.19	and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by the ligaments and sinews, grows with the growth of God. 
COL.2.20	If you have died with Christ to the elemental spirits of the world, why do you submit to them as if living in the world? 
COL.2.21	“Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch,” 
COL.2.22	which things are all meant for destruction by consuming according to human commandments and teachings, 
COL.2.23	which things although they have
COL.3.1	 Therefore, if you have been raised together with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 
COL.3.2	Set your mind on the things above, not on the things on earth. 
COL.3.3	For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 
COL.3.4	When Christ, who is your life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory. 
COL.3.5	Therefore put to death what is earthly in you
COL.3.6	because of which the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience, 
COL.3.7	in which also you once lived, when you used to live in them.
COL.3.8	But now you also lay aside all these things: anger, rage, wickedness, slander, abusive language from your mouth. 
COL.3.9	Do not lie to one another, because you
COL.3.10	and have put on the new man that is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of the one who created him, 
COL.3.11	where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free, but Christ is all, and in all. 
COL.3.12	Therefore, as the chosen of God, holy and dearly loved, put on affection, compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, 
COL.3.13	putting up with one another and forgiving one another. If anyone should have a complaint against anyone, just as also the Lord forgave you, thus also you do the same. 
COL.3.14	And to all these things add love, which is the bond of perfection. 
COL.3.15	And the peace of Christ must rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body, and be thankful. 
COL.3.16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another with all wisdom, with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God, 
COL.3.17	and everything whatever
COL.3.18	Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 
COL.3.19	Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them. 
COL.3.20	Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing in the Lord. 
COL.3.21	Fathers, do not provoke your children, so that they will not become discouraged. 
COL.3.22	Slaves, obey your human
COL.3.23	Whatever you do, accomplish it from the soul, as to the Lord, and not to people, 
COL.3.24	because you
COL.3.25	For the one who does wrong will receive back whatever wrong he has done, and there is no partiality. 
COL.4.1	 Masters, grant your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you also have a master in heaven. 
COL.4.2	Be devoted to prayer, keeping alert in it with thanksgiving, 
COL.4.3	praying at the same time for us also, that God may open for us a door of the message, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which also I am a prisoner
COL.4.4	so that I may reveal
COL.4.5	Live with wisdom toward those outside, making the most of the time. 
COL.4.6	Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how it is necessary for you to answer each one. 
COL.4.7	Tychicus, my dear brother and faithful servant and fellow slave in the Lord, will make known to you all my circumstances
COL.4.8	whom I have sent to you for this very reason, in order that you may know our circumstances
COL.4.9	together with Onesimus, my faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all the circumstances
COL.4.10	Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions—if he should come to you, welcome him), 
COL.4.11	and Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only ones who are fellow workers for the kingdom of God from the circumcision, who have been a comfort to me. 
COL.4.12	Epaphras, who is one of you, greets you, a slave of Christ
COL.4.13	For I testify to him that he is working hard
COL.4.14	Luke the physician, our dear friend, greets you, as does Demas. 
COL.4.15	Greet the brothers in Laodicea, and Nympha and the church in her
COL.4.16	And whenever this letter is read among you, see to it
COL.4.17	And tell Archippus, “Direct your attention to the ministry that you received in the Lord, in order that you may complete it.” 
COL.4.18	The greeting is by my hand, Paul’s. Remember my imprisonment
1TH.1.1	 Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you and peace. 
1TH.1.2	We give thanks to God always concerning all of you, making mention constantly in our prayers, 
1TH.1.3	because we
1TH.1.4	knowing, brothers dearly loved by God, that he has chosen you
1TH.1.5	because our gospel did not come to you with word only, but also with power and with the Holy Spirit and with much certainty, just as you know what sort of people we became among you for your sake. 
1TH.1.6	And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, receiving the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit, 
1TH.1.7	so that you became an example to all those who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia, 
1TH.1.8	for from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and Achaia,
1TH.1.9	For they themselves report about us, what sort of welcome we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, 
1TH.1.10	and to await his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus, the one who delivers us from the coming wrath. 
1TH.2.1	 For you yourselves know, brothers, our reception with you, that it was not in vain, 
1TH.2.2	but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, just as you know, we had the courage in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition. 
1TH.2.3	For our exhortation is not from error or from impurity or with deceit, 
1TH.2.4	but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, thus we speak, not as pleasing people but God, who examines our hearts. 
1TH.2.5	For never
1TH.2.6	nor seeking glory from people, neither from you nor from others. 
1TH.2.7	Although we could have insisted on our own importance
1TH.2.8	Longing for you in this way, we determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls, because you had become dear to us. 
1TH.2.9	For you remember, brothers, our labor and hardship: working by night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. 
1TH.2.10	You are witnesses, and so is God, how devoutly and righteously and blamelessly we became to you who believe, 
1TH.2.11	just as you know how we treated each one of you, like a father his own children, 
1TH.2.12	exhorting and consoling you and insisting that you live in a manner worthy of God, who calls you to his own kingdom and glory. 
1TH.2.13	And because of this we also give thanks to God constantly, that when you
1TH.2.14	For you became imitators, brothers, of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because you also suffered the same things at the hands of your own people, just as they themselves did also at the hands of the Jews, 
1TH.2.15	who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and who persecuted us, and who are not pleasing to God and are opposed to all people, 
1TH.2.16	hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles in order that they may be saved, so that they always fill up their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the end.
1TH.2.17	But when
1TH.2.18	because we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, on more than one occasion
1TH.2.19	For who is our hope or joy or crown of boasting? Is it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming? 
1TH.2.20	For you are our glory and joy. 
1TH.3.1	 Therefore when we
1TH.3.2	and we sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, in order to strengthen and to encourage you about your faith, 
1TH.3.3	so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are appointed for this, 
1TH.3.4	for indeed when we were with you we told you beforehand that we were about to be afflicted, just as indeed it happened, and you know. 
1TH.3.5	Because of this, I also, when I
1TH.3.6	But now, because
1TH.3.7	because of this, brothers, we have been comforted because of you in all our distress and affliction through your faith, 
1TH.3.8	because now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord. 
1TH.3.9	For what thanks can we repay to God concerning you, because of all the joy with which we rejoice because of you before our God, 
1TH.3.10	night and day praying beyond all measure that we may see your face and complete what is lacking in your faith? 
1TH.3.11	Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you, 
1TH.3.12	and may the Lord cause you to increase and to abound in love for one another and for all, just as also we do for you, 
1TH.3.13	so that your hearts may be established blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
1TH.4.1	 Finally therefore, brothers, we ask you and appeal to you in the Lord Jesus that, just as you have received from us how it is necessary for you to live and to please God, just as indeed you are living, that you progress even more. 
1TH.4.2	For you know what commands we gave to you through the Lord Jesus. 
1TH.4.3	For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; 
1TH.4.4	that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor, 
1TH.4.5	not in lustful passion, just as also the Gentiles who do not know God; 
1TH.4.6	not to transgress and to exploit his brother in the matter, because the Lord is the one who avenges concerning all these things, just as also we told you beforehand and testified solemnly. 
1TH.4.7	For God did not call us to impurity, but in holiness. 
1TH.4.8	Therefore the one who rejects this is not rejecting man, but God, who also gives his Holy Spirit to you. 
1TH.4.9	But concerning brotherly love, I do not have need to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another, 
1TH.4.10	for indeed you are practicing it toward all the brothers in all of Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to progress even more, 
1TH.4.11	and to aspire to live a quiet life, and to attend to your own business,
1TH.4.12	so that you may live decently toward those outside, and may have need of nothing. 
1TH.4.13	Now we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you will not grieve as also the rest, who have no hope. 
1TH.4.14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, thus also God will bring those who have fallen asleep through Jesus together with him. 
1TH.4.15	For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain until the Lord’s coming, will not possibly precede those who have fallen asleep. 
1TH.4.16	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. 
1TH.4.17	Then we who are alive, who remain, will be snatched away at the same time together with them in the clouds for a meeting with the Lord in the air, and thus we will be together with the Lord always. 
1TH.4.18	Therefore comfort one another with these words. 
1TH.5.1	 Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need of anything to be written to you, 
1TH.5.2	for you yourselves well know that the day of the Lord is coming in the same way as a thief in the night. 
1TH.5.3	Whenever they say “Peace and security,” then sudden destruction will overtake them like the birth pains of a pregnant woman
1TH.5.4	But you, brothers, are not in the darkness, so that the day should catch you like a thief, 
1TH.5.5	for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of the night nor of darkness. 
1TH.5.6	So then, we must not sleep like the rest, but must be on the alert and be self-controlled. 
1TH.5.7	For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night. 
1TH.5.8	But because
1TH.5.9	because God did not appoint us for wrath, but for the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1TH.5.10	who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live at the same time with him. 
1TH.5.11	Therefore encourage one another and build up each other
1TH.5.12	Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and rule over you in the Lord and admonish you, 
1TH.5.13	and to esteem them beyond all measure in love, because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 
1TH.5.14	And we urge you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, console the discouraged, help the sick, be patient toward all people. 
1TH.5.15	See to it that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue good toward
1TH.5.16	Rejoice always, 
1TH.5.17	pray constantly, 
1TH.5.18	give thanks in everything; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. 
1TH.5.19	Do not quench the Spirit. 
1TH.5.20	Do not despise prophecies, 
1TH.5.21	but examine all things; hold fast to what is good. 
1TH.5.22	Abstain from every form of evil. 
1TH.5.23	Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your spirit and soul and body be kept complete, blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1TH.5.24	The one who calls you is faithful, who also will do this. 
1TH.5.25	Brothers, pray for us.
1TH.5.26	Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. 
1TH.5.27	I adjure you by the Lord, have this letter read aloud to all the brothers. 
1TH.5.28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
2TH.1.1	 Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
2TH.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God the Father
2TH.1.3	We ought to give thanks to God always concerning you, brothers, just as it is fitting, because your faith is flourishing and the love of each one of you all toward one another is increasing 
2TH.1.4	so that we ourselves boast in you in the churches of God about your patient endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions that you are enduring, 
2TH.1.5	a proof of the righteous judgment of God, so that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, on behalf of which also you are suffering, 
2TH.1.6	since it is righteous in the sight of God to pay back those who are afflicting you with affliction, 
2TH.1.7	and to you who are being afflicted, rest with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels, 
2TH.1.8	with burning flame
2TH.1.9	who will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his strength, 
2TH.1.10	whenever he should come to be glorified on that day by his saints and to be marveled at by all who believe, because our testimony was believed among you, 
2TH.1.11	for which purpose we also pray always for you, that you may be considered worthy of the calling of our God, and he might fulfill every desire for goodness and work of faith with power,
2TH.1.12	in order that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
2TH.2.1	 Now we ask you, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our assembling to him, 
2TH.2.2	that you not be easily shaken from your composure, nor be troubled either by a spirit or by a message or by a letter alleged to be from us
2TH.2.3	Do not let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, 
2TH.2.4	who opposes and who exalts himself over every so-called god or object of worship, so that he sits down in the temple of God, proclaiming that he himself is God. 
2TH.2.5	Do you not remember that while
2TH.2.6	And you know that which restrains him now, so that he will be revealed in his own time. 
2TH.2.7	For the mystery of lawlessness is at work already; only the one who now restrains
2TH.2.8	and then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of his mouth, and wipe out by the appearance of his coming, 
2TH.2.9	whose coming is in accordance with the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders, 
2TH.2.10	and with every unrighteous deception against those who are perishing, in place of which they did not accept the love of the truth, so that they would be saved. 
2TH.2.11	And because of this, God sends them a powerful delusion
2TH.2.12	in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth, but delighted in unrighteousness. 
2TH.2.13	But we ought to give thanks to God always concerning you, brothers dearly loved by the Lord, because God has chosen you as first fruits for salvation by the sanctification of the Spirit and faith in the truth, 
2TH.2.14	for which purpose he called
2TH.2.15	So then, brothers, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions which you were taught, whether by spoken word or by letter from us. 
2TH.2.16	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal encouragement and good hope by grace, 
2TH.2.17	encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good work and word. 
2TH.3.1	 Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may progress and be honored, just as also it was with you, 
2TH.3.2	and that we may be delivered from evil and wicked people, for not all have the faith
2TH.3.3	But the Lord is faithful, who will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one. 
2TH.3.4	And we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are both doing and you will do the things that we are commanding. 
2TH.3.5	Now may the Lord direct your hearts toward the love of God and toward the patient endurance of Christ. 
2TH.3.6	But we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother who lives irresponsibly and not according to the tradition that they received from us. 
2TH.3.7	For you yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate us, that we did not behave irresponsibly among you, 
2TH.3.8	nor did we eat bread from anyone without paying, but with toil and labor, we were working night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you, 
2TH.3.9	not that we do not have the right, but so that we may give ourselves as an example to you, so that you may imitate us. 
2TH.3.10	For even when we were with you, we used to command this to you: that if anyone does not want to work, neither should he eat. 
2TH.3.11	For we hear that some among you are living irresponsibly, working at nothing, but being busybodies. 
2TH.3.12	Now we command and we exhort such people in the Lord Jesus Christ that, working with quietness, they eat their own bread. 
2TH.3.13	But as for you, brothers, do not be discouraged while
2TH.3.14	But if anyone does not obey our message through this letter, take note not to associate with him, in order that he may be put to shame. 
2TH.3.15	And do not consider him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. 
2TH.3.16	Now may the Lord of peace himself grant you peace through everything in every way. May the Lord be with all of you. 
2TH.3.17	The greeting is by my hand, Paul’s, which is a sign of genuineness
2TH.3.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. 
1TI.1.1	 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope, 
1TI.1.2	to Timothy, my true child in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
1TI.1.3	Just as I urged you when I
1TI.1.4	and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause useless speculations rather than God’s plan that is by faith. 
1TI.1.5	But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a faith without hypocrisy, 
1TI.1.6	from which some have deviated, and have turned away into fruitless discussion, 
1TI.1.7	wanting to be teachers of the law, although they
1TI.1.8	But we know that the law is good, if anyone makes use of it lawfully, 
1TI.1.9	knowing this, that the law is not given for a righteous person but for the lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and totally worldly, for the one who kills his father and the one who kills his mother, for murderers, 
1TI.1.10	sexually immoral people, homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and whatever
1TI.1.11	according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God that I was entrusted with. 
1TI.1.12	I give thanks
1TI.1.13	although I
1TI.1.14	and the grace of our Lord abounded with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 
1TI.1.15	The saying is trustworthy and worthy of all acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. 
1TI.1.16	But because of this I was shown mercy, in order that in me foremost, Christ Jesus might demonstrate his total patience, for an example for those who are going to believe in him for eternal life. 
1TI.1.17	Now to the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, to the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever
1TI.1.18	I am setting before you this instruction, Timothy my child, in accordance with the prophecies spoken long ago about you, in order that by them you may fight the good fight, 
1TI.1.19	having faith and a good conscience, which some, because they
1TI.1.20	among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, in order that they may be taught not to blaspheme. 
1TI.2.1	 Therefore, I urge first of all that petitions, prayers, requests, and thanksgiving be made on behalf of all people, 
1TI.2.2	on behalf of kings and all those who are in authority, in order that we may live a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. 
1TI.2.3	This is good and acceptable before God our Savior, 
1TI.2.4	who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. 
1TI.2.5	For there is one God and one mediator between God and human beings, the man Christ Jesus, 
1TI.2.6	who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony at the proper time, 
1TI.2.7	for which I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am speaking the truth, I am not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. 
1TI.2.8	Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and dispute. 
1TI.2.9	Likewise also the women should adorn themselves in appropriate clothing, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold jewelry or pearls or expensive clothing, 
1TI.2.10	but with good deeds which are fitting for women who profess godliness. 
1TI.2.11	A woman must learn in quietness with all submission. 
1TI.2.12	But I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet
1TI.2.13	For Adam was formed first, then Eve, 
1TI.2.14	and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, because she
1TI.2.15	But she will be saved through the bearing of children, if she continues in faith and love and holiness with self-control. 
1TI.3.1	 The saying is trustworthy: if anyone aspires to supervision, he desires a good work. 
1TI.3.2	Therefore the overseer must be irreproachable, the husband of one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, skillful in teaching, 
1TI.3.3	not addicted to wine, not a violent person, but gentle, peaceable, not loving money, 
1TI.3.4	managing his own household well, having children in submission with all dignity 
1TI.3.5	(but if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?), 
1TI.3.6	not newly converted, lest he become conceited and fall into the condemnation of the devil. 
1TI.3.7	But he must also have a good testimony from those outside, in order that he may not fall into disgrace and the trap of the devil. 
1TI.3.8	Deacons likewise must be dignified, not insincere, not devoted to much wine, not fond of dishonest gain, 
1TI.3.9	holding the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience, 
1TI.3.10	and these also must be tested first; then let them serve if they
1TI.3.11	The wives
1TI.3.12	Deacons must be husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households well. 
1TI.3.13	For those who have served well acquire a good standing for themselves, and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. 
1TI.3.14	I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you in a short time. 
1TI.3.15	But if I am delayed, I am writing
1TI.3.16	And most certainly, great is the mystery of godliness: 
1TI.3.16	Who was revealed in the flesh, 
1TI.3.16	was vindicated by
1TI.3.16	was seen by angels, 
1TI.3.16	was proclaimed among the Gentiles
1TI.3.16	was believed on in the world, 
1TI.3.16	was taken up in glory. 
1TI.4.1	 Now the Spirit explicitly says that in the last times some will depart from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, 
1TI.4.2	by the hypocrisy of liars, who are seared in their own conscience, 
1TI.4.3	who forbid marrying and insist on abstaining from foods that God created for sharing in with thankfulness by those who believe and who know the truth, 
1TI.4.4	because everything created by God is good and nothing is to be rejected if it is
1TI.4.5	for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer. 
1TI.4.6	By
1TI.4.7	But reject those worthless myths told by elderly women
1TI.4.8	For the training of the body is somewhat
1TI.4.9	The statement is trustworthy and deserving of complete acceptance. 
1TI.4.10	For to this end we labor and suffer reproach,
1TI.4.11	Command these things and teach them. 
1TI.4.12	Let no one look down on your youth, but be an example for the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity. 
1TI.4.13	Until I come, pay attention to the public reading,
1TI.4.14	Do not neglect the gift that is in you, that was granted to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders. 
1TI.4.15	Practice these things. Be diligent
1TI.4.16	Fix your attention on yourself and on your teaching. Continue in them, for by
1TI.5.1	 Do not rebuke an older man, but appeal to him as a father, younger men as brothers, 
1TI.5.2	older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, with all purity. 
1TI.5.3	Honor widows who are truly widows. 
1TI.5.4	But if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must learn to show profound respect for their own household first, and to pay back recompense to their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God. 
1TI.5.5	But the widow who is one truly, and is left alone, has put her hope in God and continues in her petitions and prayers night and day. 
1TI.5.6	But the one who lives for sensual pleasure is dead even though she
1TI.5.7	And command these things, in order that they may be irreproachable. 
1TI.5.8	But if someone does not provide for his own relatives, and especially the members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. 
1TI.5.9	Let a widow be put on the list if she
1TI.5.10	being well-attested by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has helped those who are oppressed, if she has devoted herself to every good work. 
1TI.5.11	But refuse younger widows, for whenever their physical desires lead them away from Christ, they want to marry, 
1TI.5.12	thus incurring condemnation because they have broken their former pledge. 
1TI.5.13	And at the same time also, going around from house to house, they learn to be idle, and not only idle, but also gossipy and busybodies, saying the things that are not necessary. 
1TI.5.14	Therefore I want younger widows to marry, to bear children, to manage a household, to give the adversary no opportunity for reproach. 
1TI.5.15	For already some have turned away and followed after Satan. 
1TI.5.16	If any believing woman has widows, she must help them, and the church must not be burdened, in order that it may help those who are truly widows. 
1TI.5.17	The elders who lead well must be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor by speaking and teaching. 
1TI.5.18	For the scripture says, “You must not muzzle an ox while it
1TI.5.19	Do not accept an accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. 
1TI.5.20	Reprove those who sin in the presence of all, in order that the rest also may experience fear. 
1TI.5.21	I testify solemnly before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing according to partiality. 
1TI.5.22	Lay hands on no one hastily, and do not participate in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. 
1TI.5.23	(No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach and your frequent illnesses.) 
1TI.5.24	The sins of some people are evident, preceding them to judgment, but for some also they follow after them. 
1TI.5.25	Likewise also good works are evident, and those considered otherwise are not able to be hidden. 
1TI.6.1	 All those who are under the yoke as slaves must regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, lest the name of God and the teaching be slandered. 
1TI.6.2	And those who have believing masters must not look down on them because they are brothers, but rather they must serve, because those who benefit by their service are believers and dearly loved. 
1TI.6.2	Teach and encourage these things. 
1TI.6.3	If anyone teaches other doctrine and does not devote himself to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that is in accordance with godliness, 
1TI.6.4	he is conceited, understanding nothing, but having a morbid interest concerning controversies and disputes about words, from which come envy, strife, slanders, evil suspicions, 
1TI.6.5	constant wrangling by people of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who consider godliness to be a means of gain. 
1TI.6.6	But godliness with contentment is a great means of gain. 
1TI.6.7	For we have brought nothing into the world, so that neither can we bring anything out. 
1TI.6.8	But if we
1TI.6.9	But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and a trap and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge those people into ruin and destruction. 
1TI.6.10	For the love of money is a root of all evil, by which some, because they
1TI.6.11	But you, O man of God, flee from these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patient endurance, gentleness. 
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 
1TI.6.13	I command you, in the sight of God who gives life to all things and Christ Jesus who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, 
1TI.6.14	that you observe the commandment without fault, irreproachable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1TI.6.15	which he will make known in his own time, the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of those who reign as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords, 
1TI.6.16	the one who alone possesses immortality, who lives in unapproachable light, whom no human being has seen nor is able to see, to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen. 
1TI.6.17	Command those who are rich in this present age not to be proud and not to put their hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in God, who provides us all things richly for enjoyment, 
1TI.6.18	to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, sharing freely, 
1TI.6.19	storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future, in order that they may take hold of what is truly life. 
1TI.6.20	O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Turn away from pointless empty talk and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge, 
1TI.6.21	which some, by
2TI.1.1	 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, 
2TI.1.2	to Timothy, my dear child. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
2TI.1.3	I am thankful
2TI.1.4	longing to see you as I
2TI.1.5	remembering the
2TI.1.6	for which reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is in you through the laying on of my hands. 
2TI.1.7	For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and love and self-discipline. 
2TI.1.8	Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor me his prisoner, but suffer along with me for the gospel, according to the power of God, 
2TI.1.9	who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace that was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began
2TI.1.10	but has now been disclosed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ,
2TI.1.11	for which I was appointed a proclaimer and an apostle and a teacher, 
2TI.1.12	for which reason also I suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, because I know in whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted until that day. 
2TI.1.13	Hold fast to the pattern of sound words which you heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.1.14	Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who lives in us. 
2TI.1.15	You know this, that all those in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. 
2TI.1.16	May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he refreshed me many times, and was not ashamed of my imprisonment, 
2TI.1.17	but when he
2TI.1.18	May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day! And how much he served me in Ephesus you know very well. 
2TI.2.1	 You, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, 
2TI.2.2	and the things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these things to faithful people who will be competent to teach others also. 
2TI.2.3	Suffer together with me as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.4	No one who serves as a soldier is entangled in the activities of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him. 
2TI.2.5	And also if anyone competes he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. 
2TI.2.6	The farmer who works hard must be the first to receive a share of the crops. 
2TI.2.7	Consider what I am saying, for the Lord will grant you understanding in all these things. 
2TI.2.8	Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David according to my gospel, 
2TI.2.9	in connection with which I suffer misfortune to the point of imprisonment
2TI.2.10	Because of this, I endure all things for the sake of the chosen, in order that they also may obtain salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 
2TI.2.11	The saying is trustworthy: 
2TI.2.11	For if we died with him, we will also live with him; 
2TI.2.12	if we endure, we will also reign with him; 
2TI.2.12	if we deny him, he also will deny us; 
2TI.2.13	if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful—he cannot deny himself
2TI.2.14	Remind people of these things, solemnly urging them before the Lord
2TI.2.15	Make every effort to present yourself approved to God, a worker having no need to be ashamed, guiding the word of truth along a straight path. 
2TI.2.16	But avoid pointless chatter, for it will progress to greater ungodliness, 
2TI.2.17	and their message will spread
2TI.2.18	who have deviated concerning the truth by
2TI.2.19	However, the solid foundation of God stands firm, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,”
2TI.2.20	Now in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthenware ones, some of which are for honorable use, and some of which are for ordinary use. 
2TI.2.21	Therefore, if someone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work. 
2TI.2.22	But flee from youthful desires, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, in company with those who call upon the Lord from a pure heart. 
2TI.2.23	But avoid foolish and uninformed controversies, because you
2TI.2.24	And the slave of the Lord must not quarrel, but be kind toward everyone, skillful in teaching, tolerant, 
2TI.2.25	correcting those who are opposed with gentleness, seeing whether perhaps God may grant them repentance to a knowledge of the truth, 
2TI.2.26	and they will come to their senses again and escape from the trap of the devil, being held captive by him to do his will. 
2TI.3.1	 But know this, that in the last days difficult times will come, 
2TI.3.2	for people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, slanderers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, 
2TI.3.3	hardhearted, irreconcilable, slanderous, without self-control, savage, with no interest for what is good, 
2TI.3.4	traitors, reckless, conceited, loving pleasure rather than loving God, 
2TI.3.5	maintaining a form of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid these people. 
2TI.3.6	For from these are those who slip into houses and captivate foolish women loaded down with sins, led by various kinds of desires, 
2TI.3.7	always learning and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth. 
2TI.3.8	And just as
2TI.3.9	But they will not progress to a greater extent, for their folly will be quite evident to everyone, as also the folly of those two was. 
2TI.3.10	But you have faithfully followed my teaching, way of life, purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, 
2TI.3.11	persecutions, and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, and in Lystra, what sort of persecutions I endured, and the Lord delivered me from all of them. 
2TI.3.12	And indeed, all those who want to live in a godly manner in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 
2TI.3.13	But evil people and imposters will progress to the worse, deceiving and being deceived. 
2TI.3.14	But you continue in the things which you have learned and are convinced of, because you
2TI.3.15	and that from childhood you have known the holy writings that are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.3.16	All scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness, 
2TI.3.17	in order that the person of God may be competent, equipped for every good work. 
2TI.4.1	 I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom, 
2TI.4.2	preach the word, be ready in season and out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all patience and instruction. 
2TI.4.3	For there will be a time when they will not put up with sound teaching, but in accordance with their own desires, they will accumulate for themselves teachers, because they have an insatiable curiosity
2TI.4.4	and they will turn away from the hearing of the truth, but will turn to myths. 
2TI.4.5	But you, be self-controlled in all things, bear hardship patiently, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. 
2TI.4.6	For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is imminent. 
2TI.4.7	I have fought the good fight, I have completed the race, I have kept the faith. 
2TI.4.8	Finally, the crown of righteousness is reserved for me, that the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me, but also to all who have loved his appearing. 
2TI.4.9	Make haste to come to me quickly. 
2TI.4.10	For Demas deserted me, because he
2TI.4.11	Luke alone is with me. Take along Mark and
2TI.4.12	But I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 
2TI.4.13	When you
2TI.4.14	Alexander the metalworker did me much harm; may the Lord pay back to him according to his deeds, 
2TI.4.15	against whom you also be on guard, because he vehemently opposed our words. 
2TI.4.16	At my first defense, no one came to my aid, but they all deserted me; may it not be counted against them. 
2TI.4.17	But the Lord helped me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fulfilled and all the Gentiles might hear, and he rescued me from the lion’s mouth. 
2TI.4.18	The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will save me for his heavenly kingdom, to whom be the glory forever and ever
2TI.4.19	Greet Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus. 
2TI.4.20	Erastus remained in Corinth, but Trophimus I left behind in Miletus because he
2TI.4.21	Make haste to come before winter. Eubulus and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers greet you. 
2TI.4.22	The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you. 
TIT.1.1	 Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of the chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth that is according to godliness, 
TIT.1.2	in the hope of eternal life which God, who does not lie, promised before eternal ages, 
TIT.1.3	but at the proper time has disclosed his message in the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the command of God our Savior, 
TIT.1.4	to Titus, my true child according to a common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. 
TIT.1.5	On account of this, I left you behind in Crete, in order that what remains may be set in order and you may appoint elders in every town, as I ordered you. 
TIT.1.6	If anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful
TIT.1.7	For it is necessary for the overseer to be blameless as God’s steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain, 
TIT.1.8	but hospitable, loving what is good, prudent, just, devout, self-controlled, 
TIT.1.9	holding fast to the faithful message according to the teaching, in order that he may be able both to exhort with sound instruction and to reprove those who speak against it. 
TIT.1.10	For there are many rebellious people, idle talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, 
TIT.1.11	whom it is necessary to silence, whoever are ruining whole families by
TIT.1.12	A certain one of them, one of their own prophets, has said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” 
TIT.1.13	This testimony is true, for which reason reprove them severely, in order that they may be sound in the faith, 
TIT.1.14	not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of people who turn away from the truth. 
TIT.1.15	To the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and conscience are defiled. 
TIT.1.16	They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny him, because they
TIT.2.1	 But you, speak the things which are fitting for sound instruction. 
TIT.2.2	Older men are to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in endurance. 
TIT.2.3	Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not slanderous, not enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good, 
TIT.2.4	in order that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands and to love their children, 
TIT.2.5	to be self-controlled, pure, busy at home, good, being subject to their own husbands, in order that the word of God may not be slandered. 
TIT.2.6	Likewise, exhort the young men to be self-controlled, 
TIT.2.7	concerning everything showing yourself to be an example of good deeds, in your teaching demonstrating soundness, dignity, 
TIT.2.8	a sound message beyond reproach, in order that an opponent
TIT.2.9	Slaves must be subject to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not to talk back, 
TIT.2.10	not stealing, but demonstrating all good faith, in order that they may do credit to the teaching of God our Savior in everything. 
TIT.2.11	For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people, 
TIT.2.12	training us in order that, denying impiety and worldly desires, we may live self-controlled and righteously and godly in the present age, 
TIT.2.13	looking forward to the blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 
TIT.2.14	who gave himself for us, in order that he might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good deeds. 
TIT.2.15	Speak these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you. 
TIT.3.1	 Remind them to be subject to the rulers and to the authorities, to obey, to be prepared for every good work, 
TIT.3.2	to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all courtesy to all people. 
TIT.3.3	For we also were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, enslaved to various desires and pleasures, spending our lives in wickedness and envy, despicable, hating one another. 
TIT.3.4	But when the kindness and love for mankind of God our Savior appeared, 
TIT.3.5	he saved us, not by deeds of righteousness that we have done, but because of his mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit, 
TIT.3.6	whom he poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
TIT.3.7	so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 
TIT.3.8	The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist concerning these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and beneficial for people. 
TIT.3.9	But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and contentions and quarrels about the law, for they are useless and fruitless. 
TIT.3.10	Reject a divisive person after a first and second admonition, 
TIT.3.11	knowing that such a person is perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned. 
TIT.3.12	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make haste to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. 
TIT.3.13	Diligently send on their way Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, so that they may lack nothing
TIT.3.14	But also our people must learn to engage in good deeds for necessary needs, so that they will not be unfruitful. 
TIT.3.15	All those with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you. 
PHM.1.1	Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker, 
PHM.1.2	and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house. 
PHM.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
PHM.1.4	I thank my God, always making mention of you in my prayers, 
PHM.1.5	because I
PHM.1.6	I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing that is in us for Christ. 
PHM.1.7	For I have great joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. 
PHM.1.8	Therefore, although I
PHM.1.9	instead I appeal to you because of love, since I
PHM.1.10	I am appealing to you concerning my child whom I became the father of during my imprisonment, Onesimus. 
PHM.1.11	Once he was useless to you, but now he is useful to you
PHM.1.12	whom I have sent back to you himself, that is, my heart, 
PHM.1.13	whom I wanted to keep with me, in order that he might serve me on behalf of you during my imprisonment for the gospel. 
PHM.1.14	But apart from your consent, I wanted to do nothing, in order that your good deed might be not as according to necessity, but according to your own free will. 
PHM.1.15	For perhaps because of this, he was separated from you for a time, in order that you might have him back forever, 
PHM.1.16	no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 
PHM.1.17	If therefore you consider me a partner, receive him as you would me. 
PHM.1.18	But if in anything he has caused you loss or owes you anything, charge this to my account
PHM.1.19	I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will pay it back, lest I mention to you that you owe me even your very self besides
PHM.1.20	Yes, brother, I ought to have some benefit of you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. 
PHM.1.21	Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you because I
PHM.1.22	At the same time also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you. 
PHM.1.23	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, 
PHM.1.24	and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. 
PHM.1.25	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. 
HEB.1.1	 Although
HEB.1.2	in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the world,
HEB.1.3	who is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence, sustaining all things by the word of power.
HEB.1.4	having become by so much better than the angels, by as much as he has inherited a more excellent name than theirs. 
HEB.1.5	For to which of the angels did he ever say, 
HEB.1.5	“You are my son, 
HEB.1.5	today I have begotten you,”
HEB.1.5	and again, 
HEB.1.5	“I will be his father
HEB.1.5	and he will be my son
HEB.1.6	And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, 
HEB.1.6	“And let all the angels of God worship him.”
HEB.1.7	And concerning the angels he says, 
HEB.1.7	“The one who makes his angels winds, 
HEB.1.7	and his servants a flame of fire,”
HEB.1.8	but concerning the Son, 
HEB.1.8	“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever
HEB.1.8	and the scepter of righteous is the scepter of your kingdom. 
HEB.1.9	You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; 
HEB.1.9	because of this God, your God, has anointed you 
HEB.1.9	with the olive oil of joy more than your companions.
HEB.1.10	And, 
HEB.1.10	“You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, 
HEB.1.10	and the heavens are the works of your hands; 
HEB.1.11	they will perish, but you continue, 
HEB.1.11	and they will all become old like a garment, 
HEB.1.12	and like a robe you will roll them up, 
HEB.1.12	and like a garment they will be changed; 
HEB.1.12	but you are the same, and your years will not run out.”
HEB.1.13	But to which of the angels has he ever said, 
HEB.1.13	“Sit down at my right hand, 
HEB.1.13	until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”
HEB.1.14	Are they not all spirits engaged in special service, sent on assignment for the sake of those who are going to inherit salvation? 
HEB.2.1	 Because of this, it is all the more necessary that we pay attention to the things we have heard, lest we drift away. 
HEB.2.2	For if the word spoken through angels was binding and every transgression and act of disobedience received a just penalty, 
HEB.2.3	how will we escape if we
HEB.2.4	while
HEB.2.5	For he did not subject to angels the world to come, about which we are speaking. 
HEB.2.6	But someone testified somewhere, saying, 
HEB.2.6	“What is man, that you remember him, 
HEB.2.6	or the son of man, that you care for him? 
HEB.2.7	You made him for a short time lower than the angels; 
HEB.2.7	you crowned him with glory and honor;
HEB.2.8	you subjected all things under his feet.
HEB.2.8	For in subjecting all things,
HEB.2.9	but we see Jesus, for a short time made lower than the angels, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that apart from God
HEB.2.10	For it was fitting for him for whom are all things and through whom are all things in bringing many sons to glory to perfect the originator of their salvation through sufferings. 
HEB.2.11	For both the one who sanctifies and the ones who are sanctified are all from one, for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers, 
HEB.2.12	saying, 
HEB.2.12	“I will proclaim your name to my brothers; 
HEB.2.12	in the midst of the assembly I will sing in praise of you.”
HEB.2.13	And again, 
HEB.2.13	“I will trust in him.”
HEB.2.13	And again, 
HEB.2.13	“Behold, I and the children God has given me.”
HEB.2.14	Therefore, since the children share in blood and flesh, he also in like manner shared in these same things, in order that through death he could destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, 
HEB.2.15	and could set free these who through fear of death were subject to slavery throughout all their lives. 
HEB.2.16	For surely he is not concerned with angels, but he is concerned with the descendants of Abraham. 
HEB.2.17	Therefore he was obligated to be made like his brothers in all respects, in order that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in the things relating to God, in order to make atonement for the sins of the people. 
HEB.2.18	For in that which he himself suffered when he
HEB.3.1	 Therefore, holy brothers, sharers in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession, 
HEB.3.2	who was faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses also was in his household.
HEB.3.3	For this one is considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, inasmuch as the one who builds it has greater honor than the house. 
HEB.3.4	For every house is built by someone, but the one who built all things is God. 
HEB.3.5	And Moses was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony to the things that would be spoken, 
HEB.3.6	but Christ was faithful
HEB.3.7	Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, 
HEB.3.7	“Today, if you hear his voice, 
HEB.3.8	do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, 
HEB.3.8	in the day of testing in the wilderness, 
HEB.3.9	where your fathers tested me by trial 
HEB.3.9	and saw my works 
HEB.3.10	for forty years. 
HEB.3.10	Therefore I was angry with this generation, 
HEB.3.10	and I said, ‘They always go astray in their heart, 
HEB.3.10	and they do not know my ways.’ 
HEB.3.11	As I swore in my anger, 
HEB.3.11	‘They will never enter
HEB.3.12	Watch out, brothers, lest there be in some of you an evil, unbelieving heart, with the result that you fall away
HEB.3.13	But encourage one another day by day
HEB.3.14	For we have become partners of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of our commitment steadfast until the end, 
HEB.3.15	while it is said
HEB.3.15	“Today, if you hear his voice, 
HEB.3.15	do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”
HEB.3.16	For who, when they
HEB.3.17	And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness? 
HEB.3.18	And to whom did he swear they would not enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient? 
HEB.3.19	And so we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief. 
HEB.4.1	 Therefore let us fear, while there
HEB.4.2	For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us
HEB.4.3	For we who have believed enter into rest,
HEB.4.3	“As I swore in my anger, 
HEB.4.3	‘They will never enter
HEB.4.3	And yet these works have been accomplished from the foundation of the world. 
HEB.4.4	For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,”
HEB.4.5	and in this passage again, ‘They will never enter
HEB.4.6	Since therefore it remains for some to enter into it, and the ones to whom the good news was proclaimed previously did not enter because of disobedience, 
HEB.4.7	again he ordains a certain day, today, speaking by David after so long a time, just as had been said before, 
HEB.4.7	“Today, if you hear his voice, 
HEB.4.7	do not harden your hearts.”
HEB.4.8	For if Joshua had caused them to rest, he would not have spoken about another day after these things. 
HEB.4.9	Consequently a sabbath rest remains for the people of God. 
HEB.4.10	For the one who has entered into his rest has also himself rested from his works, just as God did from his own works. 
HEB.4.11	Therefore, let us make every effort to enter into that rest, in order that no one may fall in the same pattern of disobedience. 
HEB.4.12	For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, both joints and marrow, and able to judge the reflections and thoughts of the heart. 
HEB.4.13	And no creature is hidden in the sight of him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of him to whom we must give our account
HEB.4.14	Therefore, because we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. 
HEB.4.15	For we do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our weaknesses, but who has been tempted in all things in the same way, without sin. 
HEB.4.16	Therefore let us approach with confidence to the throne of grace, in order that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. 
HEB.5.1	 For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of people in the things relating to God, in order that he can offer both gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins, 
HEB.5.2	being able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and led astray, since he himself also is surrounded by weakness, 
HEB.5.3	and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins for himself also, as well as for the people
HEB.5.4	And someone does not take for himself the honor, but is called by God, just as Aaron also was. 
HEB.5.5	Thus also Christ did not glorify himself to become high priest, but the one who said to him, 
HEB.5.5	“You are my Son, today I have begotten you,”
HEB.5.6	just as also in another place he says, 
HEB.5.6	“You are a priest forever
HEB.5.7	who in the days of his flesh offered up both prayers and supplications, with loud crying and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard as a result of his reverence. 
HEB.5.8	Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered, 
HEB.5.9	and being perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey him, 
HEB.5.10	being designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek. 
HEB.5.11	Concerning this
HEB.5.12	For indeed, although you
HEB.5.13	For everyone who partakes of milk is unacquainted with the message of righteousness, because he is an infant. 
HEB.5.14	But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have trained their faculties for the distinguishing of both good and evil. 
HEB.6.1	 Therefore, leaving behind the elementary message about Christ, let us move on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God, 
HEB.6.2	teaching about baptisms and laying on of hands, and resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment. 
HEB.6.3	And this we will do, if God permits. 
HEB.6.4	For it is impossible concerning those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and become sharers of the Holy Spirit, 
HEB.6.5	and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age, 
HEB.6.6	and having fallen away, to renew them again to repentance, because they
HEB.6.7	For ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth vegetation usable to those people for whose sake
HEB.6.8	But if it
HEB.6.9	But even if we are speaking in this way, dear friends, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and belonging to salvation. 
HEB.6.10	For God is not unjust, so as to forget your work and the love which you demonstrated for his name by
HEB.6.11	And we desire each one of you to demonstrate the same diligence for the full assurance of your hope until the end, 
HEB.6.12	in order that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and patience. 
HEB.6.13	For when
HEB.6.14	saying, 
HEB.6.14	“Surely I will greatly bless
HEB.6.15	And so, by
HEB.6.16	For people swear by what is greater than themselves, and the oath for confirmation is the end of all dispute for them. 
HEB.6.17	In the same way God, because he
HEB.6.18	in order that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge may have powerful encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us, 
HEB.6.19	which we have like an anchor of the soul, both firm and steadfast, and entering into the inside of the curtain, 
HEB.6.20	where Jesus, the forerunner for us, entered, because he
HEB.7.1	 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham as he
HEB.7.2	to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of everything
HEB.7.3	without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God—he remains a priest for all time. 
HEB.7.4	But see how great this man was, to whom Abraham
HEB.7.5	And indeed those of the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have a commandment to collect a tenth from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, although they are descended from Abraham
HEB.7.6	But the one who did not trace his descent from them collected tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. 
HEB.7.7	Now without any dispute the inferior is blessed by the more prominent. 
HEB.7.8	And in this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case it is testified that he lives. 
HEB.7.9	And, so to speak
HEB.7.10	For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him. 
HEB.7.11	Thus if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood, for on the basis of it the people received the law, what further need is there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and not said to be according to the order of Aaron? 
HEB.7.12	For when
HEB.7.13	For the one about whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe from which no one has officiated at the altar. 
HEB.7.14	For it is evident that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses said nothing concerning priests. 
HEB.7.15	And it is still more clear, if another priest according to the likeness of Melchizedek arises, 
HEB.7.16	who has become a priest not according to a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life. 
HEB.7.17	For it is testified, 
HEB.7.17	“You are a priest forever
HEB.7.18	For on the one hand a preceding commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness 
HEB.7.19	(for the law made nothing perfect), but on the other hand there is the introduction of a better hope through which we draw near to God. 
HEB.7.20	And by as much as this was not without an oath (for these on the one hand have become priests
HEB.7.21	but he with an oath by the one who said to him, 
HEB.7.21	“The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, 
HEB.7.21	‘You are a priest forever
HEB.7.22	by so much more
HEB.7.23	And indeed many have become
HEB.7.24	but he, because he continues forever
HEB.7.25	Therefore also he is able to save completely those who draw near to God through him, because he
HEB.7.26	For a high priest such as this indeed is fitting for us, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and having become exalted above the heavens, 
HEB.7.27	who does not need every day
HEB.7.28	For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the statement of the oath, after the law, appoints a Son, who is made perfect forever
HEB.8.1	 Now this is the main point in what has been said: we have a high priest such as this, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, 
HEB.8.2	a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord set up, not man. 
HEB.8.3	For every high priest is appointed in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices; therefore it was
HEB.8.4	Now if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because there
HEB.8.5	who serve a sketch and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned when he
HEB.8.6	But now he has attained a more excellent ministry, by as much as he is also mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted upon better promises. 
HEB.8.7	For if that first covenant had been faultless, occasion would not have been sought for a second. 
HEB.8.8	For in finding fault with them he says, 
HEB.8.8	“Behold, days are coming, says the Lord, 
HEB.8.8	when I will complete a new covenant with the house of Israel 
HEB.8.8	and with the house of Judah, 
HEB.8.9	not like the covenant which I made with their fathers 
HEB.8.9	on the day I took hold of them by my hand 
HEB.8.9	to lead them out of the land of Egypt, 
HEB.8.9	because they did not continue in my covenant 
HEB.8.9	and I disregarded them, says the Lord. 
HEB.8.10	For this is the covenant that I will decree with the house of Israel 
HEB.8.10	after those days, says the Lord: 
HEB.8.10	I am putting my laws in their minds 
HEB.8.10	and I will write them on their hearts, 
HEB.8.10	and I will be their
HEB.8.10	and they will be my
HEB.8.11	And they will not teach each one his fellow citizen 
HEB.8.11	and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ 
HEB.8.11	because they will all know me, 
HEB.8.11	from the least of them to the greatest. 
HEB.8.12	For I will be merciful toward their wrongdoings, 
HEB.8.12	and I will not remember their sins any longer.” 
HEB.8.13	In calling it new, he has declared the former to be old. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is near to disappearing. 
HEB.9.1	 Now
HEB.9.2	For a tent was prepared, the first one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the presentation of the loaves, which is called the holy place. 
HEB.9.3	And after the second curtain was a tent called the holy of holies, 
HEB.9.4	containing the golden incense altar and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which were a golden jar containing the manna and the rod of Aaron that budded and the tablets of the covenant. 
HEB.9.5	And above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, about which it is not now possible to speak in detail. 
HEB.9.6	Now these things having been prepared in this way, the priests enter into the first tent continually
HEB.9.7	but only the high priest enters into the second tent once a year, not without blood, which he offers on behalf of himself and the sins of the people committed in ignorance. 
HEB.9.8	The Holy Spirit was making this clear, that the way into the holy place was not yet revealed, while
HEB.9.9	which was a symbol for the present time, in which both the gifts and sacrifices which were offered were not able to perfect the worshiper with respect to the conscience, 
HEB.9.10	concerning instead only food and drink and different washings, regulations of outward things imposed until the time of setting things right. 
HEB.9.11	But Christ has arrived as a high priest of the good things to come. Through the greater and more perfect tent not made by hands, that is, not of this creation, 
HEB.9.12	and not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered once for all into the most holy place, obtaining eternal redemption. 
HEB.9.13	For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled sanctify them for the ritual purity of the flesh, 
HEB.9.14	how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works to serve the living God? 
HEB.9.15	And because of this, he is the mediator of a new covenant, in order that, because
HEB.9.16	For where there is a will, it is a necessity for the death of the one who made the will to be established. 
HEB.9.17	For a will is in force concerning those who are dead, since it is never in force when the one who made the will is alive. 
HEB.9.18	Therefore not even the first covenant was ratified without blood. 
HEB.9.19	For when
HEB.9.20	saying, 
HEB.9.20	“This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you.”
HEB.9.21	And likewise he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the utensils of service with the blood. 
HEB.9.22	Indeed, nearly everything is purified with blood according to the law, and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. 
HEB.9.23	Therefore it was necessary for the sketches of the things in heaven to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves to be purified with better sacrifices than these. 
HEB.9.24	For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf, 
HEB.9.25	and not in order that he can offer himself many times, as the high priest enters into the sanctuary year by year
HEB.9.26	since it would have been necessary for him to suffer many times from the foundation of the world, but now he has appeared once at the end of the ages for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of himself. 
HEB.9.27	And just as
HEB.9.28	thus also Christ, having been offered once in order to bear the sins of many, will appear for the second time without reference to sin to those who eagerly await him for salvation. 
HEB.10.1	 For the law, possessing a shadow of the good things that are about to come, not the form of things itself, is never able year by year
HEB.10.2	For otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the ones who worship, having been purified once and for all, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? 
HEB.10.3	But in them there is a reminder of sins year by year
HEB.10.4	For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 
HEB.10.5	Therefore, when he
HEB.10.5	“Sacrifice and offering you did not want, 
HEB.10.5	but a body you prepared for me; 
HEB.10.6	you did not delight in whole burnt offerings and offerings for sins. 
HEB.10.7	Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come— 
HEB.10.7	in the roll of the book it is written about me— 
HEB.10.7	to do your will, O God.’ 
HEB.10.8	When he says above, 
HEB.10.8	“Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and offerings for sin 
HEB.10.8	you did not want, nor did you delight in,”
HEB.10.8	which are offered according to the law, 
HEB.10.9	then he has said, 
HEB.10.9	“Behold, I have come to do your will.”
HEB.10.9	He takes away the first in order to establish the second, 
HEB.10.10	by which will we are made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. 
HEB.10.11	And every priest stands every day serving and offering the same sacrifices many times, which are never able to take away sins. 
HEB.10.12	But this one, after he
HEB.10.13	from now on waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet. 
HEB.10.14	For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy. 
HEB.10.15	And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying, 
HEB.10.16	“This is the covenant that I will decree for them 
HEB.10.16	after those days, says the Lord: 
HEB.10.16	I am putting my laws on their hearts, 
HEB.10.16	and I will write them on their minds.”
HEB.10.17	He also says, 
HEB.10.17	“Their sins and their lawless deeds I will never remember again.”
HEB.10.18	Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin. 
HEB.10.19	Therefore, brothers, since we
HEB.10.20	by the new and living way which he inaugurated for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh, 
HEB.10.21	and since we have
HEB.10.22	let us approach with a true heart in the full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. 
HEB.10.23	Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for the one who promised is faithful. 
HEB.10.24	And let us think about how to stir one another up to love
HEB.10.25	not abandoning our meeting together
HEB.10.26	For if
HEB.10.27	but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that is about to consume the adversaries. 
HEB.10.28	Anyone who rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. 
HEB.10.29	How much worse punishment do you think the person will be considered worthy of who treats with disdain the Son of God and who considers ordinary the blood of the covenant by which he was made holy and who insults the Spirit of grace? 
HEB.10.30	For we know the one who said, 
HEB.10.30	“Vengeance is mine, I will repay,”
HEB.10.30	and again, 
HEB.10.30	“The Lord will judge his people.”
HEB.10.31	It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God. 
HEB.10.32	But remember the former days in which, after you
HEB.10.33	sometimes being publicly exposed both to insults and to afflictions, and sometimes becoming sharers with those who were treated in this way. 
HEB.10.34	For you both sympathized with the prisoners and put up with the seizure of your belongings with joy because you
HEB.10.35	Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has great reward. 
HEB.10.36	For you have need of endurance, in order that after you
HEB.10.37	For yet 
HEB.10.37	“a very, very little while, 
HEB.10.37	and the one who is coming will come and will not delay. 
HEB.10.38	But my righteous one will live by faith, 
HEB.10.38	and if he shrinks back, my soul is not well pleased with him.”
HEB.10.39	But we are not among those who shrink back to destruction, but among those who have faith to the preservation of our souls. 
HEB.11.1	 Now faith is the realization of what is hoped for, the proof of things not seen. 
HEB.11.2	For by this the people of old were approved. 
HEB.11.3	By faith we understand the worlds were created by the word of God, in order that what is seen did not come into existence from what is visible. 
HEB.11.4	By faith Abel offered to God a greater sacrifice than Cain, by which he was approved that he was righteous, because
HEB.11.5	By faith Enoch was taken up, so that he did not experience death, and he was not found, because God took him up. For before his removal, he had been approved as having been pleasing
HEB.11.6	Now without faith it is impossible to please him, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and is a rewarder of those who seek him. 
HEB.11.7	By faith Noah, having been warned about things not yet seen, out of reverence constructed an ark for the deliverance of his family, by which he pronounced sentence on the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith. 
HEB.11.8	By faith Abraham, when he
HEB.11.9	By faith he lived in the land of promise as a stranger, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the fellow heirs of the same promise. 
HEB.11.10	For he was expecting the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 
HEB.11.11	By faith also, with Sarah
HEB.11.12	And therefore these were fathered from one man, and he being as good as dead, as the stars of heaven in number and like the innumerable sand by the shore of the sea. 
HEB.11.13	These all died in faith without receiving the promises, but seeing them from a distance and welcoming them, and admitting that they were strangers and temporary residents on the earth. 
HEB.11.14	For those who say such things make clear that they are seeking a homeland. 
HEB.11.15	And if they remember
HEB.11.16	But now they aspire to a better land, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city. 
HEB.11.17	By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered Isaac, and the one who received the promises was ready to offer his one and only son, 
HEB.11.18	with reference to whom it was said, “In Isaac your descendants will be named,”
HEB.11.19	having reasoned that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which he received him back also as a symbol. 
HEB.11.20	By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things that were going to happen. 
HEB.11.21	By faith Jacob, as he
HEB.11.22	By faith Joseph, as he
HEB.11.23	By faith Moses, when he
HEB.11.24	By faith Moses, when he
HEB.11.25	choosing instead to be mistreated with the people of God rather than to experience the transitory enjoyment of sin, 
HEB.11.26	considering reproach endured for the sake of Christ
HEB.11.27	By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king, for he persevered as if he
HEB.11.28	By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, in order that the one who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. 
HEB.11.29	By faith they crossed the Red Sea as if on dry land; the Egyptians, when they made the attempt
HEB.11.30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they
HEB.11.31	By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she
HEB.11.32	And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, and Samuel and the prophets, 
HEB.11.33	who through faith conquered kingdoms, accomplished justice, obtained what was promised, shut the mouths of lions, 
HEB.11.34	extinguished the effectiveness of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong from weakness, became mighty in battle, put to flight enemy battle lines. 
HEB.11.35	Women received back their dead by resurrection. But others were tortured, not accepting release, in order that they might gain a better resurrection. 
HEB.11.36	And others experienced mocking and flogging
HEB.11.37	They were stoned, they were sawed in two, they died by murder with a sword, they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, impoverished, afflicted, mistreated, 
HEB.11.38	of whom the world was not worthy, wandering about on deserts and mountains and in caves and in holes in the ground. 
HEB.11.39	And although they
HEB.11.40	because
HEB.12.1	 Therefore, since
HEB.12.2	fixing our eyes on Jesus, the originator and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 
HEB.12.3	For consider the one who endured such hostility by sinners against himself,
HEB.12.4	You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your
HEB.12.5	And have you completely forgotten the exhortation which instructs you as sons? 
HEB.12.5	“My son, do not make light of the Lord’s discipline, 
HEB.12.5	or give up when you are corrected by him. 
HEB.12.6	For the Lord disciplines the one whom he loves, 
HEB.12.6	and punishes every son whom he accepts.”
HEB.12.7	Endure it for discipline. God is dealing with you as sons. For what son is there whom a father does not discipline? 
HEB.12.8	But if you are without discipline, in which all legitimate sons
HEB.12.9	Furthermore, we have had our earthly fathers
HEB.12.10	For they disciplined us for a few days according to what seemed appropriate to them, but he does so for our benefit, in order that we can have a share in his holiness. 
HEB.12.11	Now all discipline seems for the moment not to be joyful but painful, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness for those who are trained by it. 
HEB.12.12	Therefore strengthen your slackened hands and your weakened knees, 
HEB.12.13	and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame will not be dislocated, but rather be healed. 
HEB.12.14	Pursue peace with everyone, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord. 
HEB.12.15	Take care that no one falls short of the grace of God; that no one growing up like a root of bitterness causes trouble, and by it many become defiled; 
HEB.12.16	that no one be a sexually immoral or totally worldly person like Esau, who for one meal traded his own birthright. 
HEB.12.17	For you know that also afterwards, when he
HEB.12.18	For you have not come to something that can be touched, and to a burning fire, and to darkness, and to gloom, and to a whirlwind, 
HEB.12.19	and to the noise of a trumpet, and to the sound of words which those who heard begged that not another word be spoken to them. 
HEB.12.20	For they could not endure what was commanded: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned.”
HEB.12.21	And the spectacle was so terrifying that Moses said, “I am terrified and trembling.”
HEB.12.22	But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to tens of thousands of angels, to the festal gathering 
HEB.12.23	and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous people made perfect, 
HEB.12.24	and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood
HEB.12.25	Watch out that you do not refuse the one who is speaking! For if those did not escape when they
HEB.12.26	whose voice shook the earth at that time, but now he has promised, saying, 
HEB.12.26	“Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven.”
HEB.12.27	Now the phrase “yet once more” indicates the removal of what is shaken, namely, things that have been created, in order that the things that are not shaken may remain. 
HEB.12.28	Therefore, since we
HEB.12.29	For indeed our God is a consuming fire. 
HEB.13.1	 Brotherly love must continue. 
HEB.13.2	Do not neglect hospitality, because through this some have received angels as guests without knowing it. 
HEB.13.3	Remember the prisoners, as though you were fellow-prisoners; remember
HEB.13.4	Marriage must be held in honor by all, and the marriage bed be undefiled, because God will judge sexually immoral people and adulterers. 
HEB.13.5	Your lifestyle must be free from the love of money, being content with what you have. For he himself has said, “I will never desert you, and I will never abandon you.”
HEB.13.6	So then, we can say with confidence, 
HEB.13.6	“The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid.
HEB.13.6	What will man do to me?”
HEB.13.7	Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you; considering the outcome of their way of life
HEB.13.8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever
HEB.13.9	Do not be carried away by various and strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods by which those who participate have not benefited. 
HEB.13.10	We have an altar from which those who serve in the tabernacle do not have the right to eat. 
HEB.13.11	For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sins are burned up outside the camp. 
HEB.13.12	Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the gate, in order that he might sanctify the people by his own blood. 
HEB.13.13	So we must go out to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach. 
HEB.13.14	For here we do not have a permanent city, but we seek the city that is to come. 
HEB.13.15	Therefore through him let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually
HEB.13.16	And do not neglect doing good and generosity, for God is pleased with such sacrifices. 
HEB.13.17	Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account, so that they can do this with joy and not with groaning, for this would be unprofitable for you. 
HEB.13.18	Pray for us, for we are convinced that we have a good conscience, and want to conduct ourselves commendably in every way. 
HEB.13.19	And I especially urge you to do this, so that I may be restored to you more quickly. 
HEB.13.20	Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant, 
HEB.13.21	equip you with every good thing to do his will, carrying out in us what is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever
HEB.13.22	Now I urge you, brothers, bear with my word of exhortation, for indeed I have written to you briefly
HEB.13.23	Know that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I will see you, if he comes quickly enough. 
HEB.13.24	Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you. 
HEB.13.25	Grace be with all of you. 
JAS.1.1	 James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the dispersion. Greetings! 
JAS.1.2	Consider it all joy, my brothers, whenever you encounter various trials, 
JAS.1.3	because you
JAS.1.4	And let endurance have its perfect effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking in nothing. 
JAS.1.5	Now if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask for it from God, who gives to all without reservation and not reproaching, and it will be given to him. 
JAS.1.6	But let him ask for it in faith, without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed about. 
JAS.1.7	For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 
JAS.1.8	he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. 
JAS.1.9	Now let the brother of humble circumstances boast in his high position, 
JAS.1.10	but the rich person in his humiliation, because he will pass away like a flower of the grass. 
JAS.1.11	For the sun rises with its burning heat and dries up the grass, and its flower falls off, and the beauty of its appearance is lost. So also the rich person in his pursuits
JAS.1.12	Blessed is the person
JAS.1.13	No one who is being tempted should say, “I am being tempted by God,” for God cannot be tempted
JAS.1.14	But each one is tempted when he
JAS.1.15	Then desire, after it
JAS.1.16	Do not be deceived, my dear brothers. 
JAS.1.17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of change. 
JAS.1.18	By his
JAS.1.19	Understand this, my dear brothers: every person must be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, 
JAS.1.20	for human
JAS.1.21	Therefore, putting aside all moral uncleanness and wicked excess, welcome
JAS.1.22	But be doers of the message and not hearers only,
JAS.1.23	because if anyone is a hearer of the message and not a doer, this one is like someone
JAS.1.24	for he looks at himself and goes away and immediately forgets what sort of person he was. 
JAS.1.25	But the one who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues to do it, not being a forgetful hearer but a doer who acts, this one will be blessed in what he does
JAS.1.26	If anyone thinks he is religious, although he
JAS.1.27	Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our
JAS.2.1	 My brothers, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with partiality. 
JAS.2.2	For if someone
JAS.2.3	and you look favorably on the one wearing the fine clothing and you say, “Be seated here in a good place,” and to the poor person you say, “You stand or be seated there
JAS.2.4	have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? 
JAS.2.5	Listen, my dear brothers! Did not God choose the poor of the world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him? 
JAS.2.6	But you have dishonored the poor! Are not the rich exploiting you and they themselves dragging you into the courts? 
JAS.2.7	Do they themselves not blaspheme the good name of the one to whom you belong
JAS.2.8	However, if you carry out the royal law according to the scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,”
JAS.2.9	But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and thus
JAS.2.10	For whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles in one point only has become guilty of all of it. 
JAS.2.11	For the one who said “Do not commit adultery”
JAS.2.12	Thus speak and thus act as those who are going to be judged by the law of liberty. 
JAS.2.13	For judgment is merciless to the one who has not practiced mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. 
JAS.2.14	What is the benefit, my brothers, if someone says that he has faith but does not have works? That faith is not able to save him, is it?
JAS.2.15	If a brother or a sister is poorly clothed and lacking food for the day, 
JAS.2.16	and one of you should say to them, “Go in peace, keep warm and eat well
JAS.2.17	Thus also faith, if it does not have works, is dead by itself. 
JAS.2.18	But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.”
JAS.2.19	You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe, and shudder! 
JAS.2.20	But do you want to know, O foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? 
JAS.2.21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he
JAS.2.22	You see that faith was working together with his works, and by the works the faith was perfected. 
JAS.2.23	And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness,”
JAS.2.24	You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. 
JAS.2.25	And likewise was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she
JAS.2.26	For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead. 
JAS.3.1	 Not many should become teachers, my brothers, because you
JAS.3.2	For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect individual,
JAS.3.3	And if we put bits in the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we also guide their whole bodies. 
JAS.3.4	Behold also ships: although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot wishes. 
JAS.3.5	So also the tongue is a small member of the body
JAS.3.6	And the tongue is a fire! The world of unrighteousness,
JAS.3.7	For every species of animals and birds, of reptiles and sea creatures, is being tamed and has been tamed by the human species, 
JAS.3.8	but no human being is able to tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. 
JAS.3.9	With it we bless the
JAS.3.10	From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so! 
JAS.3.11	A spring does not pour forth from the same opening fresh and bitter water, does it?
JAS.3.12	A fig tree is not able, my brothers, to produce olives, or a grapevine figs. Neither can a saltwater spring produce fresh water. 
JAS.3.13	Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his
JAS.3.14	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and tell lies against the truth. 
JAS.3.15	This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. 
JAS.3.16	For where there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there is disorder and every evil practice. 
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, obedient, full of mercy and good fruits, nonjudgmental, without hypocrisy, 
JAS.3.18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace among
JAS.4.1	 From where are conflicts and from where are quarrels among you? Is it not from this, from your pleasures that wage war among your members? 
JAS.4.2	You desire and do not have; you murder and are filled with envy, and are not able to obtain; you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask. 
JAS.4.3	You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, in order that you may spend it on your pleasures. 
JAS.4.4	Adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 
JAS.4.5	Or do you think that in vain the scripture says, “The spirit which he caused to dwell in us desires jealously”?
JAS.4.6	But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says, 
JAS.4.6	“God opposes the proud, 
JAS.4.6	but gives grace to the humble.”
JAS.4.7	Therefore subject yourselves to God. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 
JAS.4.8	Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded! 
JAS.4.9	Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your
JAS.4.10	Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you. 
JAS.4.11	Do not speak evil of one another, brothers. The one who speaks evil of a brother or judges his brother speaks evil of the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of the law.
JAS.4.12	There is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your
JAS.4.13	Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will travel to such and such a city and spend a year there, and carry on business and make a profit,” 
JAS.4.14	you who do not know what will happen tomorrow
JAS.4.15	Instead you should say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.” 
JAS.4.16	But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. 
JAS.4.17	Therefore, to the one who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin. 
JAS.5.1	 Come now, you rich people, weep and cry aloud over the miseries that are coming upon you! 
JAS.5.2	Your wealth has rotted, and your clothing has become moth-eaten. 
JAS.5.3	Your gold and silver have become corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you, and it will consume your flesh like fire. You have stored up treasure in the last days. 
JAS.5.4	Behold, the wages that were held back by you from the workers who reap your fields cry out, and the cries of the reapers have come to the ears of the Lord of hosts. 
JAS.5.5	You have lived self-indulgently on the earth
JAS.5.6	You have condemned, you have murdered the righteous person; he does not resist you. 
JAS.5.7	Therefore be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the soil, being patient concerning it until it receives the early and late rains. 
JAS.5.8	You also be patient. Strengthen your hearts, because the coming of the Lord is near. 
JAS.5.9	Brothers, do not complain against one another, in order that you may not be judged. Behold, the judge stands before the doors! 
JAS.5.10	Brothers, take as an example of perseverance and endurance the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. 
JAS.5.11	Behold, we consider blessed those who have endured. You have heard about the patient endurance of Job, and you saw the outcome from the Lord, that the Lord is compassionate and merciful. 
JAS.5.12	Now above all, my brothers, do not swear either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your yes be yes and your no, no, in order that you may not fall under judgment. 
JAS.5.13	Is anyone among you suffering misfortune? He should pray. Is anyone cheerful? He should sing praise. 
JAS.5.14	Is anyone among you sick? He should summon the elders of the church and they should pray over him, anointing him with olive oil in the name of the Lord. 
JAS.5.15	And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins he will be forgiven
JAS.5.16	Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous person accomplishes much. 
JAS.5.17	Elijah was a human being
JAS.5.18	And he prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit. 
JAS.5.19	My brothers, if anyone among you should wander away from the truth and someone turns him back, 
JAS.5.20	he should know that the one who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save that person’s
1PE.1.1	 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen
1PE.1.2	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience and for sprinkling with the blood of Jesus Christ. May grace and peace be multiplied to you. 
1PE.1.3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
1PE.1.4	into an inheritance imperishable and undefiled and unfading, reserved in heaven for you 
1PE.1.5	who are being protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time, 
1PE.1.6	in which you rejoice greatly, although
1PE.1.7	so that the genuineness of your faith, more valuable than gold that is passing away, but is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ, 
1PE.1.8	whom, although you
1PE.1.9	obtaining the goal of your faith, the salvation of your
1PE.1.10	Concerning this
1PE.1.11	investigating for what person or which time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he
1PE.1.12	to whom it was revealed that they were serving not themselves but you with reference to the same things which now have been announced to you through those who proclaimed the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which
1PE.1.13	Therefore, when you have prepared your minds for action
1PE.1.14	As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former desires you used to conform to
1PE.1.15	but as the one who called you is holy, you yourselves be holy in all your conduct, 
1PE.1.16	for it is written, “You will be holy, because I am
1PE.1.17	And if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves with fear during the time of your temporary residence, 
1PE.1.18	because you
1PE.1.19	but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb 
1PE.1.20	who was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has been revealed in these last times for you 
1PE.1.21	who through him are believing in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God. 
1PE.1.22	Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for sincere brotherly love, love one another fervently from the heart,
1PE.1.23	because you
1PE.1.24	For 
1PE.1.24	“all flesh is like grass, 
1PE.1.24	and all its glory like the flower of the grass. 
1PE.1.24	The grass withers and the flower falls off, 
1PE.1.25	but the word of the Lord endures forever
1PE.1.25	And this is the word that has been proclaimed to you. 
1PE.2.1	 Therefore, ridding yourselves of all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, 
1PE.2.2	like newborn infants long for the unadulterated spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up to salvation, 
1PE.2.3	if you have tasted that the Lord is kind,
1PE.2.4	to whom you are drawing near, a living stone rejected by men but chosen and precious in the sight of God. 
1PE.2.5	And you yourselves, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 
1PE.2.6	For it stands in scripture, 
1PE.2.6	“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a chosen and precious cornerstone, 
1PE.2.6	and the one who believes in him will never be put to shame.”
1PE.2.7	Therefore the honor is for you who believe, but for those who refuse to believe, 
1PE.2.7	“The stone that the builders rejected, 
1PE.2.7	this one has become the cornerstone
1PE.2.8	and 
1PE.2.8	“A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense,”
1PE.2.8	who stumble because they
1PE.2.9	But you are a chosen race,
1PE.2.10	who once were not a people, but now are the people of God, the ones who were not shown mercy, but now are shown mercy.
1PE.2.11	Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and temporary residents to abstain from fleshly desires which wage war against your
1PE.2.12	maintaining your good conduct among the Gentiles, so that in the things in which they slander you as evildoers, by seeing your good deeds they may glorify God on the day of visitation. 
1PE.2.13	Subject yourselves to every human authority for the sake of the Lord, whether to a king
1PE.2.14	or to governors as those sent out by him for the punishment of those who do evil and the praise of those who do good. 
1PE.2.15	For the will of God is as follows: by
1PE.2.16	Live as free persons, and not using your
1PE.2.17	Honor all people, love the community of believers, fear God, honor the king.
1PE.2.18	Domestic slaves, be subject to your
1PE.2.19	For this finds favor, if because of consciousness of God someone endures sorrows while
1PE.2.20	For what credit is it if, when you
1PE.2.21	For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you should follow in his footsteps, 
1PE.2.22	who did not commit sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth,
1PE.2.23	who when he
1PE.2.24	who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we may die to sins and live to righteousness, by whose wounds you were healed. 
1PE.2.25	For you were going astray like sheep, but you have turned back now to the shepherd and guardian of your souls. 
1PE.3.1	 In the same way, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some are disobedient to the word, they may be won over without a word by the conduct of their wives, 
1PE.3.2	when they
1PE.3.3	Let your
1PE.3.4	but the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is highly valuable in the sight of God. 
1PE.3.5	For in the same way formerly the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves by
1PE.3.6	like Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children you have become when you
1PE.3.7	Husbands, in the same way live with your wives knowledgeably
1PE.3.8	And finally, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, showing mutual affection, compassionate, humble, 
1PE.3.9	not repaying evil for evil or insult for insult, but on the other hand blessing others, because for this reason you were called, so that you could inherit a blessing. 
1PE.3.10	For 
1PE.3.10	“The one who wants to love life 
1PE.3.10	and see good days 
1PE.3.10	must keep his
1PE.3.10	and his lips must not speak deceit. 
1PE.3.11	And he must turn away from evil and do good; 
1PE.3.11	he must seek peace and pursue it. 
1PE.3.12	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, 
1PE.3.12	and his ears are open to their prayer. 
1PE.3.12	But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
1PE.3.13	And who is the one who will harm you if you are a zealous adherent for what is good? 
1PE.3.14	But even if you might suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. And do not be afraid of their intimidation or be disturbed,
1PE.3.15	but set Christ apart as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense to anyone who asks you for an accounting concerning the hope that is in you. 
1PE.3.16	But do so with courtesy and respect, having a good conscience, so that in the things in which you are slandered, the ones who malign your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame. 
1PE.3.17	For it is better to suffer for doing good, if God wills it
1PE.3.18	For Christ also suffered once for sins, 
1PE.3.18	the just for the unjust, 
1PE.3.18	in order that he could bring you to God, 
1PE.3.18	being put to death in the flesh, 
1PE.3.18	but made alive in the spirit, 
1PE.3.19	in which also he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, 
1PE.3.20	who were formerly disobedient, when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah, while
1PE.3.21	And
1PE.3.22	who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, with angels and authorities and powers having been subjected to him. 
1PE.4.1	 Therefore, because
1PE.4.2	in order to live the remaining time in the flesh no longer for human desires, but for the will of God. 
1PE.4.3	For the time that has passed was sufficient to do what the Gentiles desire to do
1PE.4.4	with respect to which they are surprised when
1PE.4.5	They
1PE.4.6	Because for this reason also the gospel was preached to those who are dead, so that they were judged by human standards
1PE.4.7	Now the end of all things draws near. Therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for your prayers. 
1PE.4.8	Above all, keep
1PE.4.9	Be hospitable to one another without complaining. 
1PE.4.10	Just as each one has received a gift, use it for serving one another, as good stewards of the varied grace of God. 
1PE.4.11	If anyone speaks, let it be as the oracles of God; if anyone serves, let it be as by the strength that God provides, so that in all things God will be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the power forever and ever
1PE.4.12	Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, when it
1PE.4.13	But to the degree that you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that also at the revelation of his glory you may rejoice and be glad. 
1PE.4.14	If you are reviled on account of the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. 
1PE.4.15	By all means do not let anyone of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler. 
1PE.4.16	But if someone suffers as a Christian, he must not be ashamed, but must glorify God with this name. 
1PE.4.17	For it is the time for the judgment to begin out from the household of God. But if it begins out from us first, what will be the outcome for those who are disobedient to the gospel of God? 
1PE.4.18	And if the righteous are saved with difficulty, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner
1PE.4.19	So then also those who suffer according to the will of God must entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing good. 
1PE.5.1	 Therefore I, your fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and
1PE.5.2	shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not by compulsion but willingly, in accordance with God, and not greedily but eagerly, 
1PE.5.3	and not as lording it over those under your care
1PE.5.4	And when
1PE.5.5	In the same way, younger men, be subject to the elders, and all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble. 
1PE.5.6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you at the right time, 
1PE.5.7	casting all your cares on him, because he cares
1PE.5.8	Be sober; be on the alert. Your adversary the devil walks around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. 
1PE.5.9	Resist him
1PE.5.10	And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ,
1PE.5.11	To him be the power forever and ever
1PE.5.12	Through Silvanus, the faithful brother (as I consider him), I have written to you briefly
1PE.5.13	She who is in Babylon, chosen the same as you, greets you, and so does my son Mark. 
1PE.5.14	Greet one another with a loving kiss. Peace to all of you who are in Christ. 
2PE.1.1	 Simeon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a faith equal in value to ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ. 
2PE.1.2	May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, 
2PE.1.3	because his divine power has bestowed on us all things that are necessary for life and godliness, through the knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence of character, 
2PE.1.4	through which things he has bestowed on us his precious and very great promises, so that through these you may become sharers of the divine nature after
2PE.1.5	and for this same reason, and by
2PE.1.6	and with knowledge, self-control, and with self-control, patient endurance, and with patient endurance, godliness, 
2PE.1.7	and with godliness, brotherly love, and with brotherly love, love. 
2PE.1.8	For if
2PE.1.9	For the one for whom these things are not present is blind, being nearsighted, having forgotten the cleansing
2PE.1.10	Therefore, brothers, be zealous even more to make your calling and election secure, because if you
2PE.1.11	For in this way entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly supplied for you. 
2PE.1.12	Therefore I intend to remind you continually concerning these things, although you know them and are established in the truth that you have. 
2PE.1.13	But I consider it right, for as long as I am in this habitation, to stir you up by a reminder, 
2PE.1.14	because I
2PE.1.15	And I will also make every effort that you are able at any time, after my departure, to recall these things to mind
2PE.1.16	For we did not make known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ by
2PE.1.17	For he received honor and glory from God the Father when
2PE.1.18	And we ourselves heard this voice brought from heaven when we
2PE.1.19	and we possess as more reliable the prophetic word, to which you do well if you
2PE.1.20	recognizing this above all, that every prophecy of scripture does not come about from one’s own interpretation, 
2PE.1.21	for no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men carried along by the Holy Spirit spoke from God. 
2PE.2.1	 But there were also false prophets among the people, as there will be false teachers among you also, who will bring in destructive heresies
2PE.2.2	And many will follow their licentious ways, because of whom the way of truth will be reviled. 
2PE.2.3	And in greediness they will exploit you with false words, whose condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep. 
2PE.2.4	For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but held them captive in Tartarus with chains of darkness and handed them over to be kept for judgment, 
2PE.2.5	and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a proclaimer of righteousness, and seven others
2PE.2.6	and condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction, reducing them to ashes, having appointed them as an example for those who are going to be ungodly, 
2PE.2.7	and rescued righteous Lot, worn down by the way of life of lawless persons in licentiousness 
2PE.2.8	(for that righteous man, as he
2PE.2.9	then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to reserve the unrighteous to be punished at
2PE.2.10	and especially those who go after the flesh in defiling lust
2PE.2.10	Bold and arrogant, they do not tremble in awe as they
2PE.2.11	whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, do not bring against them a demeaning judgment.
2PE.2.12	But these persons, like irrational animals born only with natural instincts for capture and killing, blaspheming about things
2PE.2.13	being harmed as the wages of unrighteousness. Considering reveling in the daytime a pleasure, they are stains and blemishes, carousing in their deceitful pleasures when they
2PE.2.14	having eyes full of desire for an adulteress and unceasing from sin, enticing unstable persons, and
2PE.2.15	By
2PE.2.16	but received a rebuke for his own lawlessness: a speechless donkey, speaking with a human voice, restrained the prophet’s madness
2PE.2.17	These people are waterless springs and mists driven by a hurricane, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved. 
2PE.2.18	For by speaking high-sounding but empty words
2PE.2.19	promising them freedom although they
2PE.2.20	For if, after they
2PE.2.21	For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment that had been delivered to them. 
2PE.2.22	The statement of the true proverb has happened to them, “A dog returns to its own vomit,”
2PE.3.1	 Dear friends, this is already the second letter I am writing to you, in both of which I am attempting to stir up your sincere mind by a reminder, 
2PE.3.2	to remember the words proclaimed beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles, 
2PE.3.3	above all knowing this, that in the last days scoffers will come with scoffing, following according to their own desires 
2PE.3.4	and saying, “Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since
2PE.3.5	For when
2PE.3.6	by means of which things the world that existed at that time was destroyed by
2PE.3.7	But by the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly people. 
2PE.3.8	Now, dear friends, do not let this one thing escape your notice, that one day with the Lord is like a thousand years, and a thousand years is like one day. 
2PE.3.9	The Lord is not delaying the promise, as some consider slowness, but is being patient toward you, because he
2PE.3.10	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will disappear with a rushing noise, and the celestial bodies will be destroyed by
2PE.3.11	Because
2PE.3.12	while
2PE.3.13	But according to his promise, we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness resides. 
2PE.3.14	Therefore, dear friends, because you
2PE.3.15	And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as also our dear brother Paul wrote to you, according to the wisdom that was given to him, 
2PE.3.16	as he does also in all his
2PE.3.17	Therefore, dear friends, because you
2PE.3.18	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen. 
1JN.1.1	 What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and our hands have touched, concerning the word of life—
1JN.1.2	and the life was revealed, and we have seen and testify and announce to you the eternal life which was with the Father and was revealed to us—
1JN.1.3	what we have seen and heard, we announce to you also, in order that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 
1JN.1.4	And these things we write, in order that our joy may be complete. 
1JN.1.5	And this is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light and there is no darkness in him at all. 
1JN.1.6	If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.
1JN.1.7	But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. 
1JN.1.8	If we say that we do not have sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 
1JN.1.9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, so that he will forgive us our
1JN.1.10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. 
1JN.2.1	 My little children, I am writing these things to you in order that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous one, 
1JN.2.2	and he
1JN.2.3	And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. 
1JN.2.4	The one who says “I have come to know him,” and does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in this person. 
1JN.2.5	But whoever keeps his word, truly in this person the love of God has been perfected. By this we know that we are in him. 
1JN.2.6	The one who says that he resides in him ought also to walk
1JN.2.7	Dear friends, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the message which you have heard. 
1JN.2.8	Again, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you, because
1JN.2.9	The one who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness until now. 
1JN.2.10	The one who loves his brother resides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him. 
1JN.2.11	But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 
1JN.2.12	I am writing to you, little children, because
1JN.2.13	I am writing to you, fathers, because
1JN.2.14	I have written to you, children, because
1JN.2.15	Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him, 
1JN.2.16	because everything that is in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the arrogance of material possessions—is not from the Father, but is from the world. 
1JN.2.17	And the world is passing away, and its desire,
1JN.2.18	Children, it is the last hour, and just as you have heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen, by which we know that it is the last hour. 
1JN.2.19	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us. But they went out
1JN.2.20	And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know. 
1JN.2.21	I have not written to you because
1JN.2.22	Who is the liar except the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This person is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. 
1JN.2.23	Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also. 
1JN.2.24	As for you, what you have heard from the beginning must remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. 
1JN.2.25	And this is the promise which he himself promised us: eternal life. 
1JN.2.26	These things I have written to you concerning the ones who are trying to deceive you. 
1JN.2.27	And as for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do not have need that anyone teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you reside
1JN.2.28	And now, little children, remain in him, so that whenever he is revealed we may have confidence and not be put to shame before him at his coming. 
1JN.2.29	If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone
1JN.3.1	 See what sort of love the Father has given to us: that we should be called children of God, and we are! Because of this the world does not know us: because it did not know him. 
1JN.3.2	Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that whenever he is revealed we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is. 
1JN.3.3	And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as that one is pure. 
1JN.3.4	Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness. 
1JN.3.5	And you know that that one was revealed in order that he might take away sins, and in him there is no sin. 
1JN.3.6	Everyone who resides in him does not sin. Everyone who sins has neither seen him nor known him. 
1JN.3.7	Little children, let no one deceive you: the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as that one is righteous. 
1JN.3.8	The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed: in order to destroy the works of the devil. 
1JN.3.9	Everyone who is fathered by God does not practice sin, because his seed resides in him, and he is not able to sin, because he has been fathered by God. 
1JN.3.10	By this the children of God and the children of the devil are evident: everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, namely, the one who does not love his brother. 
1JN.3.11	For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning: that we should love one another, 
1JN.3.12	not as Cain, who was of the evil one and violently murdered his brother. And for what reason
1JN.3.13	Do not marvel,
1JN.3.14	We know that we have passed over from death to life because we love the brothers. The one who does not love remains in death. 
1JN.3.15	Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that every murderer does not have eternal life residing in him. 
1JN.3.16	We have come to know love by this: that he
1JN.3.17	But whoever has the world’s material possessions and observes his brother in need
1JN.3.18	Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth. 
1JN.3.19	By this
1JN.3.20	that
1JN.3.21	Dear friends, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God, 
1JN.3.22	and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what is pleasing in his sight
1JN.3.23	And this is his commandment: that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he commanded us
1JN.3.24	And the one who keeps his commandments resides in him, and he in him. And by this we know that he resides in us: by the Spirit whom he has given to us. 
1JN.4.1	 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to determine if they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 
1JN.4.2	By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ
1JN.4.3	and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God, and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world. 
1JN.4.4	You are from God, little children, and have conquered them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 
1JN.4.5	They are from the world; therefore
1JN.4.6	We are from God. The one who knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit. 
1JN.4.7	Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been fathered by God and knows God. 
1JN.4.8	The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 
1JN.4.9	By this the love of God is revealed in us: that God sent his one and only Son into the world in order that we may live through him. 
1JN.4.10	In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation
1JN.4.11	Dear friends, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another. 
1JN.4.12	No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God resides in us and his love is perfected in us. 
1JN.4.13	By this we know that we reside in him and he in us: that
1JN.4.14	And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. 
1JN.4.15	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God resides in him and he in God. 
1JN.4.16	And we have come to know and have believed the love that God has in us. God is love, and the one who resides in love resides in God, and God resides in him. 
1JN.4.17	By this love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because just as that one is, so also are we in this world. 
1JN.4.18	There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear includes punishment, and the one who is afraid has not been perfected in love. 
1JN.4.19	We love, because he first loved us. 
1JN.4.20	If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar, for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen is not able to love God whom he has not seen. 
1JN.4.21	And this is the commandment we have from him: that the one who loves God should love his brother also. 
1JN.5.1	 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been fathered by God, and everyone who loves the father
1JN.5.2	By this we know that we love the children of God: whenever we love God and keep his commandments. 
1JN.5.3	For this is the love of God: that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome, 
1JN.5.4	because everyone who is fathered by God conquers the world. 
1JN.5.4	And this is the victory which has conquered the world: our faith. 
1JN.5.5	Now who is the one who conquers the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 
1JN.5.6	This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ, not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 
1JN.5.7	For there are three that testify,
1JN.5.8	the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are in agreement
1JN.5.9	If we receive the testimony of people, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that he has testified concerning his Son. 
1JN.5.10	(The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. The one who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning his Son.) 
1JN.5.11	And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 
1JN.5.12	The one who has the Son has the life; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. 
1JN.5.13	These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, in order that you may know that you have eternal life. 
1JN.5.14	And this is the confidence that we have before him: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 
1JN.5.15	And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked from him. 
1JN.5.16	If anyone should see his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he should ask, and he will grant life to him, to those who sin not leading to death. (There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should ask about that. 
1JN.5.17	All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death.) 
1JN.5.18	We know that everyone who is fathered by God does not sin, but the one fathered by God, he protects him, and the evil one does not touch him. 
1JN.5.19	We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. 
1JN.5.20	And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, in order that we may know the one who is true, and we are in the one who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This one is the true God and eternal life. 
1JN.5.21	Little children, guard yourselves from idols. 
2JN.1.1	The elder, to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth—and not I alone, but also all those who know the truth—
2JN.1.2	because of the truth that resides in us and will be with us forever
2JN.1.3	Grace, mercy, peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father in truth and love. 
2JN.1.4	I was very glad
2JN.1.5	And now I ask you, lady (not as if I were writing a new commandment to you, but one that we have had from the beginning), that we should love one another. 
2JN.1.6	And this is love: that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it. 
2JN.1.7	For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ
2JN.1.8	Watch yourselves that you do not lose what we have worked for, but receive a full reward. 
2JN.1.9	Everyone who goes too far and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God. The one who remains in the teaching—this person has both the Father and the Son. 
2JN.1.10	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house and do not speak a greeting to him, 
2JN.1.11	because the one who speaks a greeting to him shares in his evil deeds. 
2JN.1.12	Although
2JN.1.13	The children of your elect sister greet you. 
3JN.1.1	The elder, to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in the truth. 
3JN.1.2	Dear friend, I pray you may prosper concerning everything and be healthy, just as your soul prospers. 
3JN.1.3	For I rejoiced exceedingly when the
3JN.1.4	I have no greater joy than this: that I hear my children are walking in the truth. 
3JN.1.5	Dear friend, you act faithfully
3JN.1.6	They have testified to your love before the church; you will do well to send them
3JN.1.7	For they have gone out on behalf of the name, accepting nothing from the pagans.
3JN.1.8	Therefore we ought to support such people, so that we become fellow workers with the truth. 
3JN.1.9	I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who wants to be first among them, does not acknowledge us. 
3JN.1.10	Therefore, if I come, I will call attention to the deeds he is doing
3JN.1.11	Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God. 
3JN.1.12	Demetrius has been testified to by all, even by the truth itself. And we also testify to him, and you know that our testimony is true. 
3JN.1.13	I have many things to write to you, but I do not want to write to you by means of ink and pen. 
3JN.1.14	But I hope to see you right away, and to speak face to face
3JN.1.15	Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name. 
JUD.1.1	Jude,
JUD.1.2	May mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you. 
JUD.1.3	Dear friends, although I
JUD.1.4	For certain men
JUD.1.5	Now I want to remind you, although you know everything once and for all,
JUD.1.6	And the angels who did not keep to their own domain but deserted their proper dwelling place, he has kept in eternal bonds under deep gloom for the judgment of the great day, 
JUD.1.7	as Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns around them indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire
JUD.1.8	Despite that, in the same way also these men, because of their
JUD.1.9	But Michael the archangel, when he argued with the devil, disputing concerning the body of Moses, did not dare to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, “The Lord rebuke you!” 
JUD.1.10	But these persons blaspheme all that they do not understand, and all that they understand by instinct like the irrational animals, by these things they are being destroyed. 
JUD.1.11	Woe to them! For they have traveled in the way of Cain, and have given themselves up to the error of Balaam for gain, and have perished
JUD.1.12	These are the ones feasting together without reverence, hidden reefs at your love feasts, caring for themselves, waterless clouds carried away by winds, late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, uprooted, 
JUD.1.13	wild waves of the sea foaming up their own shameful deeds, wandering stars, for whom the deep gloom of darkness has been reserved for eternity. 
JUD.1.14	And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, also prophesied about
JUD.1.15	to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly
JUD.1.16	These people are grumblers, discontented, proceeding according to their
JUD.1.17	But you, dear friends, remember the words proclaimed beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
JUD.1.18	for they said to you,
JUD.1.19	These are the ones who cause divisions, worldly, not having the Spirit. 
JUD.1.20	But you, dear friends, by
JUD.1.21	keep yourselves in the love of God, looking forward to the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life. 
JUD.1.22	And have mercy on those who doubt, 
JUD.1.23	and save others by
JUD.1.24	Now to the one who is able to protect you from stumbling and make you to stand before his glory blameless
JUD.1.25	to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, power, and authority before all time and now and for all eternity. Amen. 
REV.1.1	 The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his slaves the things which must take place in a short time, and communicated it by
REV.1.2	who testified about the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all that he saw. 
REV.1.3	Blessed is the one who reads aloud and blessed are
REV.1.4	John, to the seven churches in Asia:
REV.1.5	and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth. 
REV.1.5	To the one who loves us and released us from our sins by his blood 
REV.1.6	and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father—to him be the glory and the power forever and ever
REV.1.7	Behold, he is coming with the clouds, 
REV.1.7	and every eye will see him, 
REV.1.7	even every one who pierced him, 
REV.1.7	and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over him. 
REV.1.7	Yes, amen. 
REV.1.8	I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, the one who is and the one who was and the one who is coming, the All-Powerful. 
REV.1.9	I, John, your brother and co-sharer in the affliction and kingdom and steadfastness in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus. 
REV.1.10	I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a great sound like a trumpet 
REV.1.11	saying, “What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.” 
REV.1.12	And I turned to see the voice which was speaking with me, and when I
REV.1.13	and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching to the feet and girded around his
REV.1.14	and his head and hair were white like wool, white as snow, and his eyes were like a fiery flame, 
REV.1.15	and his feet were like fine bronze when it has been fired in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters, 
REV.1.16	and he had in his right hand seven stars, and a sharp double-edged sword coming out of his mouth, and his face was like the sun shining in its strength. 
REV.1.17	And when I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead person, and he placed his right hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid! I am the first and the last, 
REV.1.18	and the one who lives, and I was dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever
REV.1.19	Therefore, write the things which you saw, and the things which are, and the things which are about to take place after these things. 
REV.1.20	As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand and the seven gold lampstands—the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches. 
REV.2.1	 “To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: 
REV.2.1	“This is what the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand says, the one who walks in the midst of the seven gold lampstands: 
REV.2.2	‘I know your works, and your labor and patient endurance, and that you are not able to tolerate evil, and you put to the test those who call themselves apostles and are not, and you found them to be false. 
REV.2.3	And you have patient endurance, and have endured many things because of my name, and have not become weary. 
REV.2.4	But I have this against you: that you have left your first love. 
REV.2.5	Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the works you did at first
REV.2.6	But you do have this: that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, things which I also hate. 
REV.2.7	The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will grant to him to eat from the tree of life which is in the paradise of God.’ 
REV.2.8	“And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: 
REV.2.8	“This is what the first and the last says, who was dead and came to life: 
REV.2.9	‘I know your affliction and poverty (but you are rich), and the slander of those who call themselves Jews
REV.2.10	Do not be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested, and you will experience affliction ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life. 
REV.2.11	The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will never be harmed by the second death.’ 
REV.2.12	“And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: 
REV.2.12	“This is what the one who has the sharp double-edged sword says: 
REV.2.13	‘I know where you live, where the throne of Satan is. And you hold fast to my name and did not deny your
REV.2.14	But I have a few things against you: that you have there those who hold fast to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat food sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality. 
REV.2.15	So likewise you also have those who hold fast to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. 
REV.2.16	Therefore repent! But if you do not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword from my mouth. 
REV.2.17	The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give to him some of the hidden manna, and I will give to him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, that no one knows except the one who receives it.’ 
REV.2.18	“And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: 
REV.2.18	“This is what the Son of God says, the one who has his eyes like a fiery flame and his feet like fine bronze: 
REV.2.19	‘I know your works, and your love, and faith, and service, and patient endurance—and your last works are greater than the first. 
REV.2.20	But I have against you that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, the one who calls herself a prophetess, and teaches and deceives my slaves to commit sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. 
REV.2.21	And I have given her time in order to repent, and she did not want to repent from her sexual immorality. 
REV.2.22	Behold, I am throwing her into a sickbed and those who committed adultery with her into great affliction, unless they repent from her deeds. 
REV.2.23	And I will kill her children with deadly disease, and all the churches will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts, and I will give to each one of you according to your deeds. 
REV.2.24	But I say to you, to the rest who are in Thyatira, all those who do not hold this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they say, I do not put upon you any other burden. 
REV.2.25	Nevertheless, hold fast to what you have until I come. 
REV.2.26	And the one who conquers and who keeps my works until the end, I will give him authority over the nations, 
REV.2.27	and “he will shepherd them with an iron rod; he will break them in pieces like jars made of clay,”
REV.2.28	as I also have received from my Father, and I will give him the morning star. 
REV.2.29	The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’ 
REV.3.1	 “And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: 
REV.3.1	“This is what the one who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars says: ‘I know your works, that you have a name that you are alive, and you are dead. 
REV.3.2	Be on the alert and strengthen the remaining things that are about to die, for I have not found your works completed before my God. 
REV.3.3	Therefore remember how you have received and heard, and observe it, and repent. If therefore you are not on the alert, I will come like a thief, and you will never know at what hour I will come against you. 
REV.3.4	But you have a few people
REV.3.5	The one who conquers in this way will be dressed in white clothing, and I will never erase his name from the book of life, and I will declare his name before my Father and before his angels. 
REV.3.6	The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’ 
REV.3.7	“And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: 
REV.3.7	“This is what the holy one, the true one, the one who has the key of David, the one who opens and no one can shut, and who shuts and no one can open, says: 
REV.3.8	‘I know your works (behold, I have put before you an opened door that no one is able to shut
REV.3.9	Behold, I am causing those of the synagogue of Satan, the ones who call themselves Jews and are not, but are lying—behold, I will make them come
REV.3.10	Because you have kept the word of my patient endurance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing that is about to come upon the whole inhabited world, to put to the test those who live on the earth. 
REV.3.11	I am coming quickly! Hold fast to what you have, so that no one may take away your crown. 
REV.3.12	The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will never go outside again, and I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem that comes down from heaven from my God, and my new name. 
REV.3.13	The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’ 
REV.3.14	“And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: 
REV.3.14	“This is what the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the originator
REV.3.15	‘I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were cold or hot! 
REV.3.16	Thus, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to vomit you out of my mouth! 
REV.3.17	Because you are saying, “I am rich, and have become rich, and I have need of nothing,” and you do not know that you are wretched and pitiable and poor and blind and naked, 
REV.3.18	I advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire, in order that you may become rich, and white clothing, in order that you may be clothed and the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed, and eye salve to smear on your eyes, in order that you may see. 
REV.3.19	As many as I love, I reprove and discipline. Be zealous, therefore, and repent! 
REV.3.20	Behold, I stand at the door and knock! If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, indeed I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with me. 
REV.3.21	The one who conquers, I will grant to him to sit down with me on my throne, as I also have conquered and have sat down with my Father on his throne. 
REV.3.22	The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’ ” 
REV.4.1	 After these things I looked, and behold, an open door in heaven, and the former voice that I had heard like a trumpet speaking with me was saying, “Come up here and I will show you the things which must take place after these things.” 
REV.4.2	Immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one was seated on the throne. 
REV.4.3	And the one seated was similar in appearance to jasper and carnelian stone, and a rainbow was around the throne similar in appearance to emerald. 
REV.4.4	And around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders dressed in white clothing, and on their heads were gold crowns. 
REV.4.5	And from the throne came out lightnings and sounds and thunders, and seven torches of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. 
REV.4.6	And before the throne was something like a sea of glass, like crystal, and in the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back. 
REV.4.7	And the first living creature was similar to a lion, and the second living creature was similar to an ox, and the third living creature had a face like a man’s, and the fourth living creature was similar to an eagle flying. 
REV.4.8	And the four living creatures, each one
REV.4.8	“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God All-Powerful,
REV.4.8	the one who was and the one who is and the one who is coming!” 
REV.4.9	And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one who is seated on the throne, the one who lives forever and ever
REV.4.10	the twenty-four elders fall down before the one who is seated on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever
REV.4.11	“You are worthy, our Lord and God, 
REV.4.11	to receive glory and honor and power, 
REV.4.11	because you have created all things, 
REV.4.11	and because of your will they existed and were created.” 
REV.5.1	 And I saw in the right hand of the one who is seated on the throne a scroll, written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals. 
REV.5.2	And I saw a powerful angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?” 
REV.5.3	And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it. 
REV.5.4	And I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. 
REV.5.5	And one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals. 
REV.5.6	And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as though slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent into all the earth. 
REV.5.7	And he came and took the scroll
REV.5.8	And when he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one of whom had a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. 
REV.5.9	And they were singing a new song, saying, 
REV.5.9	“You are worthy to take the scroll 
REV.5.9	and to open its seals, 
REV.5.9	because you were slaughtered, 
REV.5.9	and bought people for God by your blood 
REV.5.9	from every tribe and language and people and nation, 
REV.5.10	and made them a kingdom and priests to our God, 
REV.5.10	and they will reign on the earth.” 
REV.5.11	And I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and of the living creatures and of the elders, and their number was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands times thousands, 
REV.5.12	saying with a loud voice, 
REV.5.12	“Worthy is the Lamb who was slaughtered 
REV.5.12	to receive power and riches 
REV.5.12	and wisdom and strength 
REV.5.12	and honor and glory and praise!” 
REV.5.13	And I heard every creature that is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and in the sea and everything in them saying, 
REV.5.13	“To the one who is seated on the throne and to the Lamb 
REV.5.13	be praise and honor and glory and power
REV.5.13	forever and ever
REV.5.14	And the four living creatures were saying, “Amen!” and the elders fell down and worshiped. 
REV.6.1	 And I watched when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying like the sound of thunder, “Come!” 
REV.6.2	And I looked, and behold, a white horse, and the one seated on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and in order that he might conquer. 
REV.6.3	And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come!” 
REV.6.4	And another horse came out, fiery red, and it was granted to the one seated on it to take peace from the earth, and that they would slaughter one another, and a large sword was given to him. 
REV.6.5	And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, “Come!” And I looked, and behold, a black horse, and the one seated on it had a balance scale in his hand. 
REV.6.6	And I heard something like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not damage the olive oil and the wine!” 
REV.6.7	And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard a voice from the fourth living creature saying, “Come!” 
REV.6.8	And I looked, and behold, a pale green horse, and the one seated on it was named
REV.6.9	And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they had, 
REV.6.10	and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, “How long
REV.6.11	And to each one of them a white robe was given, and it was said to them that they should rest yet a short time, until the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed as they had been were completed also. 
REV.6.12	And I watched when he opened the sixth seal, and a great earthquake took place, and the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood, 
REV.6.13	and the stars of heaven
REV.6.14	And the sky was split apart like a scroll that is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved from their place. 
REV.6.15	And the kings of the earth, and the most important people, and the military leaders, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free person hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains, 
REV.6.16	And they said to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, 
REV.6.17	because the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?” 
REV.7.1	 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind could blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree. 
REV.7.2	And I saw another angel ascending from the east
REV.7.3	saying, “Do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the slaves of our God on their foreheads.” 
REV.7.4	And I heard the number of the ones who were sealed, one hundred forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel: 
REV.7.5	from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed, 
REV.7.5	from the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand, 
REV.7.5	from the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand, 
REV.7.6	from the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand, 
REV.7.6	from the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand, 
REV.7.6	from the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand, 
REV.7.7	from the tribe of Simeon,
REV.7.7	from the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand, 
REV.7.7	from the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand, 
REV.7.8	from the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand, 
REV.7.8	from the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand, 
REV.7.8	from the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed. 
REV.7.9	After these things I looked, and behold, a great crowd that no one was able to number, from every nation and tribe and people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes and with palm branches in their hands. 
REV.7.10	And they were crying out with a loud voice, saying, 
REV.7.10	“Salvation to our God 
REV.7.10	who is seated on the throne, 
REV.7.10	and to the Lamb!” 
REV.7.11	And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, 
REV.7.12	saying, 
REV.7.12	“Amen! Praise and glory, 
REV.7.12	and wisdom and thanksgiving, 
REV.7.12	and honor and power and strength 
REV.7.12	be to our God forever and ever
REV.7.13	And one of the elders answered, saying to me, “These who are dressed in the white robes—who are they, and from where have they come?” 
REV.7.14	And I said to him, “My lord, you know.” And he said to me, 
REV.7.14	“These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation, 
REV.7.14	and have washed their robes 
REV.7.14	and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
REV.7.15	Because of this, they are before the throne of God, 
REV.7.15	and they serve
REV.7.15	and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter
REV.7.16	They will not be hungry any longer or be thirsty any longer, 
REV.7.16	nor will the sun ever beat down on them, nor any heat,
REV.7.17	because the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them 
REV.7.17	and will lead them to springs of living waters, 
REV.7.17	and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”
REV.8.1	 And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. 
REV.8.2	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. 
REV.8.3	And another angel who had a golden censer came and stood at the altar, and a large amount of incense was given to him, in order that he could offer the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar that is before the throne. 
REV.8.4	And the smoke of the incense went up before God with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel. 
REV.8.5	And the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire from the altar and threw it to the earth, and there were thunders and sounds and lightnings and an earthquake. 
REV.8.6	And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves in order to blow them. 
REV.8.7	And the first blew the trumpet, and there was hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was thrown to the earth, and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up. 
REV.8.8	And the second angel blew the trumpet, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood, 
REV.8.9	and a third of the creatures in the sea—the ones which had life—died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. 
REV.8.10	And the third angel blew the trumpet, and a great star burning like a torch fell from heaven, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. 
REV.8.11	And the name of the star was called Wormwood, and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the waters because they were made bitter. 
REV.8.12	And the fourth angel blew the trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened, and the day did not shine with respect to a third of it, and the night likewise. 
REV.8.13	And I looked, and I heard one eagle flying directly overhead
REV.9.1	 And the fifth angel blew the trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth, and the key of the shaft of the abyss was given to him. 
REV.9.2	And he opened the shaft of the abyss, and smoke went up from the shaft like smoke from a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the shaft. 
REV.9.3	And out of the smoke locusts came to the earth, and power was given to them like the scorpions of the earth have power. 
REV.9.4	And it was told to them that they should not damage the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, except those people who do not have the seal of God on their
REV.9.5	And it was granted to them that they should not kill them, but that they would be tormented five months, and their torment is like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a person. 
REV.9.6	And in those days people will seek death and will never find it, and they will long to die, and death will flee from them. 
REV.9.7	And the appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle, and on their heads were something like crowns similar in appearance to gold, and their faces were like men’s faces, 
REV.9.8	and they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions, 
REV.9.9	and they had breastplates like iron breastplates, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of many horse-drawn chariots
REV.9.10	And they have tails similar in appearance to scorpions, and stings, and their power to injure people for five months is in their tails. 
REV.9.11	They have as king over them the angel of the abyss, whose name
REV.9.12	The first woe has passed. Behold, two woes are still coming after these things. 
REV.9.13	And the sixth angel blew the trumpet, and I heard one voice from the horns
REV.9.14	saying to the sixth angel, the one who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who have been bound at the great river Euphrates!” 
REV.9.15	And the four angels who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year were released, in order that they should kill a third of humanity. 
REV.9.16	And the number of the troops of the cavalry was two hundred million
REV.9.17	And in this way I saw the horses in the vision, and those seated on them, who had fiery red and hyacinth-colored and sulphurous yellow breastplates, and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and sulphur. 
REV.9.18	By these three plagues a third of humanity was killed—by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur that came out of their mouths. 
REV.9.19	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails are similar in appearance to snakes, having heads, and with them they cause injury.
REV.9.20	And the rest of humanity who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands, in order not to worship
REV.9.21	and they did not repent of their murders or of their magic spells or of their sexual immorality or of their thefts. 
REV.10.1	 And I saw another powerful angel descending from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, and a rainbow over his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire,
REV.10.2	and holding in his hand a little scroll that was opened. And he put his right foot on the sea and his
REV.10.3	And he cried out with a loud voice like a lion roars, and when he cried out, the seven thunders sounded
REV.10.4	And when the seven thunders spoke,
REV.10.5	And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven 
REV.10.6	and swore by the one who lives forever and ever
REV.10.7	But in the days of the sound of the seventh angel, whenever he is about to blow the trumpet, then
REV.10.8	And the voice that I had heard from heaven was speaking with me again and saying, “Go, take the opened scroll in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.” 
REV.10.9	And I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll, and he said to me, “Take and eat it up, and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.” 
REV.10.10	And I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it up, and it was sweet as honey in my mouth, and when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter. 
REV.10.11	And they said to me, “It is necessary for you to prophesy again about many peoples and nations and languages and kings.” 
REV.11.1	 And a measuring rod similar in appearance to a staff was given to me, saying, “Get up and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it. 
REV.11.2	And leave out the courtyard outside of the temple, and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample the holy city for forty two months. 
REV.11.3	And I will grant authority
REV.11.4	These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. 
REV.11.5	And if anyone wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouth and consumes their enemies. And if anyone wants to harm them, in this way he must be killed. 
REV.11.6	These have the authority to shut the sky, so that it does not rain
REV.11.7	And when they have completed their testimony, the beast that comes up from the abyss will make war with them and will conquer them and will kill them. 
REV.11.8	And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which is called symbolically Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. 
REV.11.9	And those from peoples and tribes and languages and nations will see their dead bodies three and a half days, and they will not allow their dead bodies to be placed in a tomb. 
REV.11.10	And those who live on the earth will rejoice over them, and will celebrate and will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who live on the earth. 
REV.11.11	And after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. 
REV.11.12	And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here,” and they went up into heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them. 
REV.11.13	And at that hour a great earthquake took place, and a tenth of the city collapsed, and seven thousand people
REV.11.14	The second woe has passed. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly! 
REV.11.15	And the seventh angel blew the trumpet, and there was a loud voice in heaven saying, 
REV.11.15	“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord 
REV.11.15	and of his Christ, 
REV.11.15	and he will reign forever and ever
REV.11.16	And the twenty-four elders who are seated on their thrones before God fell down on their faces and worshiped God, 
REV.11.17	saying, 
REV.11.17	“We give thanks to you, Lord God All-Powerful, 
REV.11.17	the one who is and the one who was, 
REV.11.17	because you have taken your great power 
REV.11.17	and have begun to reign. 
REV.11.18	And the nations were angry, 
REV.11.18	and your wrath has come, 
REV.11.18	and the time for the dead to be judged, 
REV.11.18	and to give their
REV.11.18	and to the saints and to the ones who fear your name, 
REV.11.18	the small and the great, 
REV.11.18	and to destroy those who destroy the earth.” 
REV.11.19	And the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant appeared in his temple, and there were lightnings and sounds and thunders and an earthquake and large hail.
REV.12.1	 And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun and with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars, 
REV.12.2	and who was pregnant
REV.12.3	And another sign appeared in heaven, and behold, a great fiery red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven royal headbands.
REV.12.4	And his tail swept away a third of the stars from heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, in order that whenever she gave birth to her child he could devour it. 
REV.12.5	And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is going to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod,
REV.12.6	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared there by God, so that they could feed her there for one thousand two hundred sixty days. 
REV.12.7	And there was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against
REV.12.8	And they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them any longer in heaven. 
REV.12.9	And the great dragon was thrown down, the ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. 
REV.12.10	And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, 
REV.12.10	“Now the salvation and the power 
REV.12.10	and the kingdom of our God 
REV.12.10	and the authority of his Christ have come, 
REV.12.10	because the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, 
REV.12.10	the one who accuses them before our God day and night. 
REV.12.11	And they conquered him by the blood of the Lamb 
REV.12.11	and by the word of their testimony, 
REV.12.11	and they did not love their lives until death. 
REV.12.12	Because of this, rejoice, you heavens, 
REV.12.12	and those who live in them! 
REV.12.12	Woe to the earth and to the sea, 
REV.12.12	because the devil has come down to you, 
REV.12.12	having great anger, 
REV.12.12	because he
REV.12.13	And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. 
REV.12.14	And the two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman, in order that she could fly into the wilderness, to her place where she is fed there for a time, and times, and half a time, from the presence of the serpent. 
REV.12.15	And from his mouth the serpent spouted water like a river after the woman, in order that he could make her swept away by a river. 
REV.12.16	And the earth came to the aid of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon had spouted out of his mouth. 
REV.12.17	And the dragon was angry at the woman, and went away to fight against
REV.12.18	And he stood on the sand of the sea. 
REV.13.1	 And I saw coming up out of the sea a beast that had ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns ten royal headbands,
REV.13.2	And the beast that I saw was similar to a leopard, and its feet were like a bear’s, and its mouth was like the mouth of a lion, and the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority. 
REV.13.3	And one of its heads appeared as though slaughtered to death, and its fatal wound
REV.13.4	And they worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who is able to make war with him? 
REV.13.5	And a mouth was given to him speaking great things and blasphemies, and authority to act was given to him for forty-two months. 
REV.13.6	And he opened his mouth for blasphemies toward God, to blaspheme his name and his dwelling, those who live in heaven. 
REV.13.7	And it was given to him to make war with the saints and to conquer them. And authority was given to him over every tribe and people and language and nation. 
REV.13.8	And all those who live on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name is not written
REV.13.9	If anyone has an ear, let him hear! 
REV.13.10	If anyone is going into captivity, into captivity he goes. 
REV.13.10	If anyone is to be killed by the sword, by the sword he is to be killed. 
REV.13.10	Here is the patient endurance and the faith of the saints. 
REV.13.11	And I saw another beast coming up from the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he was speaking like a dragon. 
REV.13.12	And he exercises all the authority of the first beast on behalf of him, and he causes the earth and those who live in it to worship the first beast whose fatal wound had been healed
REV.13.13	And he performs great signs, so that he even causes fire from heaven to come down to the earth before people. 
REV.13.14	And he deceives those who live on the earth because of the signs that it has been granted to him to perform on behalf of the beast, telling those who live on the earth to make an image to the beast who has the wound of the sword and yet lived. 
REV.13.15	And it was given to him to put breath into the image of the beast, in order that the image of the beast both spoke and caused that all those, unless they worshiped the image of the beast, should be killed. 
REV.13.16	And he causes all people, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, that they give them a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, 
REV.13.17	and that no one was able to buy or to sell except the one who had the mark—the name of the beast or the number of his name. 
REV.13.18	Here is wisdom: the one who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man’s number,
REV.14.1	 And I looked, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him one hundred forty-four thousand who had his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads. 
REV.14.2	And I heard a sound from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the sound that I heard was like harpists playing on their harps. 
REV.14.3	And they were singing something like a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders, and no one was able to learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand who had been bought from the earth. 
REV.14.4	These are those who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were bought from humanity as first fruits to God and to the Lamb, 
REV.14.5	and in their mouth a lie was not found; they are blameless. 
REV.14.6	And I saw another angel flying directly overhead
REV.14.7	saying with a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and worship the one who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and the springs of water!” 
REV.14.8	And another second angel followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, who caused all the nations to drink from the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality.” 
REV.14.9	And another third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, 
REV.14.10	he himself also will drink of the wine of the anger of God that has been mixed full strength in the cup of his wrath, and will be tortured with fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. 
REV.14.11	And the smoke of their torture went up forever and ever
REV.14.12	Here is the patient endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith in Jesus. 
REV.14.13	And I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write: 
REV.14.13	‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!’ ” 
REV.14.13	“Yes,” says the Spirit, “in order that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow after them.” 
REV.14.14	And I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud was seated one like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. 
REV.14.15	And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud, “Send out your sickle and reap, because the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe!” 
REV.14.16	And the one seated on the cloud swung his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. 
REV.14.17	And another angel came out of the temple that is in heaven; he also had a sharp sickle. 
REV.14.18	And another angel who had authority over the fire went out from the altar, and he called out with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying, “Send out your sharp sickle and harvest the clusters of grapes from the vine of the earth, because its grapes are at their prime!” 
REV.14.19	And the angel swung his sickle into the earth and harvested the vine of the earth, and threw the grapes
REV.14.20	And the winepress was stomped outside the city, and blood went out from the winepress up to the bridles of the horses, about one thousand six hundred stadia.
REV.15.1	 And I saw another great and marvelous sign in heaven: seven angels having seven plagues that are the last ones, because with them the wrath of God is completed. 
REV.15.2	And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had conquered the beast and his image and the number of his name were standing by
REV.15.3	And they were singing the song of Moses, the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: 
REV.15.3	“Great and marvelous are your works, 
REV.15.3	Lord God All-Powerful; 
REV.15.3	righteous and true are your ways, 
REV.15.3	King of the ages!
REV.15.4	Who would never fear, Lord, 
REV.15.4	and glorify your name? 
REV.15.4	For only you are holy, 
REV.15.4	because all the nations
REV.15.4	and worship before you, 
REV.15.4	because your righteous deeds have been revealed.” 
REV.15.5	And after these things I looked, and the temple, the tent of the testimony in heaven, was opened, 
REV.15.6	and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out from the temple, dressed in clean, bright linen garments, and girded with golden belts around their
REV.15.7	And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever
REV.15.8	and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed. 
REV.16.1	 And I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.” 
REV.16.2	And the first went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and there was an evil and painful sore on the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image. 
REV.16.3	And the second poured out his bowl on the sea, and it became blood, like that of a dead person, and every living thing that was in the sea died. 
REV.16.4	And the third poured out his bowl on the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood. 
REV.16.5	And I heard the angel of the waters saying, 
REV.16.5	“You are righteous, the one who is and the one who was, the Holy One, 
REV.16.5	because you have judged these things, 
REV.16.6	because they have poured out the blood of the saints and prophets, 
REV.16.6	and you have given them blood to drink; 
REV.16.6	they are deserving!” 
REV.16.7	And I heard the altar saying, 
REV.16.7	“Yes, Lord God All-Powerful, 
REV.16.7	true and righteous are your judgments.” 
REV.16.8	And the fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was granted to it to burn up people with fire. 
REV.16.9	And people were burned up by the great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God who has the authority over these plagues, and they did not repent to give him glory. 
REV.16.10	And the fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became darkened, and they began chewing their tongues because of the pain. 
REV.16.11	And they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pain and because of their sores, and they did not repent of their deeds. 
REV.16.12	And the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, in order that the way would be prepared for the kings from the east
REV.16.13	And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet three unclean spirits like frogs. 
REV.16.14	For they are the spirits of demons performing signs that go out to the kings of the whole inhabited world, to gather them for the battle of the great day of God the All-Powerful. 
REV.16.15	(Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who is on the alert and who keeps his clothing, so that he does not walk around naked and they see his shamefulness!) 
REV.16.16	And he gathered them to the place called in Hebrew Armageddon. 
REV.16.17	And the seventh poured out his bowl on the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple, from the throne, saying, “It is done!” 
REV.16.18	And there were lightnings and sounds and thunders, and there was a great earthquake, as has not happened from the time humanity has been on the earth—so great in this way was the earthquake. 
REV.16.19	And the great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of his furious wrath.
REV.16.20	And every island fled, and mountains were not found. 
REV.16.21	And large hailstones, weighing about a hundred pounds,
REV.17.1	 And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who is seated on many waters, 
REV.17.2	with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality, and those who live on the earth became drunk with the wine of her sexual immorality.” 
REV.17.3	And he carried me away into the wilderness in the Spirit,
REV.17.4	And the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, holding a golden cup in her hand full of detestable things and the unclean things of her sexual immorality. 
REV.17.5	And on her forehead a name was written, a mystery: “Babylon the great, the mother of prostitutes and of the detestable things of the earth.” 
REV.17.6	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses to Jesus. 
REV.17.6	And I was greatly astonished when I saw her
REV.17.7	And the angel said to me, “Why are you astonished? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that has the seven heads and the ten horns that carries her. 
REV.17.8	The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is going to come up from the abyss, and he is going to destruction. And those who live on the earth, whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will be astonished when they
REV.17.9	Here is the mind that has wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits
REV.17.10	Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and whenever he comes it is necessary for him to remain a short time. 
REV.17.11	And the beast that was, and is not, is also himself an eighth, and is of the seven, and he is going to destruction. 
REV.17.12	And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but they will receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast. 
REV.17.13	These have one opinion, and they will give their power and authority to the beast. 
REV.17.14	These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.” 
REV.17.15	And he said to me, “The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples and crowds and nations and languages. 
REV.17.16	And the ten horns that you saw and the beast, these will hate the prostitute and will make her desolate and naked, and they will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire. 
REV.17.17	For God put into their hearts to carry out his purpose and to make a unanimous decision
REV.17.18	And the woman that you saw is the great city that has sovereignty over the kings of the earth. 
REV.18.1	 After these things I saw another angel descending from heaven, who had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. 
REV.18.2	And he cried out with a powerful voice, saying, 
REV.18.2	“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, 
REV.18.2	and it has become a dwelling place of demons 
REV.18.2	and a haunt of every unclean spirit 
REV.18.2	and a haunt of every unclean bird 
REV.18.2	and a haunt of every unclean and detested animal. 
REV.18.3	For all the nations have drunk
REV.18.3	from the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality, 
REV.18.3	and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her, 
REV.18.3	and the merchants of the earth have become rich 
REV.18.3	from the power of her sensuality.” 
REV.18.4	And I heard another voice from heaven saying, 
REV.18.4	“Come out from her, my people, 
REV.18.4	so that you will not participate in her sins, 
REV.18.4	and so that you will not receive her plagues, 
REV.18.5	because her sins have reached up to heaven, 
REV.18.5	and God has remembered her crimes. 
REV.18.6	Pay back to her as she herself also paid out, 
REV.18.6	and pay back double
REV.18.6	in the cup that she mixed, mix double for her. 
REV.18.7	As much as she glorified herself and lived in luxury, 
REV.18.7	give to her so much torment and mourning, 
REV.18.7	because in her heart she said, 
REV.18.7	‘I sit as a queen, and am not a widow, 
REV.18.7	and I will never see mourning!’ 
REV.18.8	Because of this her plagues will come in one day— 
REV.18.8	death and mourning and famine— 
REV.18.8	and she will be burned up with fire, 
REV.18.8	because the Lord God who passes judgment on her is powerful!” 
REV.18.9	And the kings of the earth will weep and mourn over her, those who committed sexual immorality and lived sensually with her, when they see the smoke of her burning, 
REV.18.10	standing far off
REV.18.10	“Woe, woe, the great city, 
REV.18.10	Babylon the powerful city, 
REV.18.10	because in one hour your judgment has come!” 
REV.18.11	And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo any more—
REV.18.12	cargo of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple cloth and silk and scarlet cloth and all kinds of scented wood and all kinds of ivory goods and all kinds of goods of precious wood and bronze and iron and marble 
REV.18.13	and cinnamon and amomum
REV.18.14	“And the fruit your soul desires
REV.18.14	and all the luxury and the splendor has perished from you, 
REV.18.14	and they will never find them any more.” 
REV.18.15	The merchants of these things, who became rich from them, will stand far off
REV.18.16	saying, 
REV.18.16	“Woe, woe, the great city, 
REV.18.16	dressed in fine linen and purple cloth and scarlet cloth, 
REV.18.16	and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, 
REV.18.17	because in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!” 
REV.18.17	And every shipmaster and every seafarer
REV.18.18	and began to cry out when they
REV.18.19	And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying, 
REV.18.19	“Woe, woe, the great city, 
REV.18.19	in which all those who had ships on the sea 
REV.18.19	became rich from her prosperity, 
REV.18.19	because in one hour she has been laid waste!” 
REV.18.20	Rejoice over her, heaven 
REV.18.20	and the saints and the apostles and the prophets, 
REV.18.20	because God has pronounced your judgment on her!” 
REV.18.21	And one powerful angel picked up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, 
REV.18.21	“In this way Babylon the great city will be thrown down with violence, 
REV.18.21	and will never be found again! 
REV.18.22	And the sound of harpists and musicians and flute players and trumpeters 
REV.18.22	will never be heard in you again! 
REV.18.22	And every craftsman of every trade 
REV.18.22	will never be found in you again! 
REV.18.22	And the sound of a mill 
REV.18.22	will never be heard in you again! 
REV.18.23	And the light of a lamp 
REV.18.23	will never shine in you again! 
REV.18.23	And the sound of a bridegroom and bride 
REV.18.23	will never be heard in you again! 
REV.18.23	For your merchants were the most important people of the earth, 
REV.18.23	because with your sorcery they deceived all the nations. 
REV.18.24	And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints 
REV.18.24	and all those who had been slaughtered on the earth. 
REV.19.1	 After these things I heard something like the loud sound of a great crowd in heaven saying, 
REV.19.1	“Hallelujah! 
REV.19.1	Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, 
REV.19.2	because his judgments are true and righteous, 
REV.19.2	because he has passed judgment on the great prostitute 
REV.19.2	who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, 
REV.19.2	and has avenged the blood of his slaves shed by
REV.19.3	And a second time they said, 
REV.19.3	“Hallelujah!” 
REV.19.3	And her smoke goes up forever and ever
REV.19.4	And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is seated on the throne, saying, 
REV.19.4	“Amen! Hallelujah!” 
REV.19.5	And a voice came out from the throne, saying, 
REV.19.5	“Praise our God 
REV.19.5	all his slaves, 
REV.19.5	and those who fear him, 
REV.19.5	the small and the great!” 
REV.19.6	And I heard something like the sound of a great crowd and something like the sound of many waters and something like the sound of powerful thunder, saying, 
REV.19.6	“Hallelujah! 
REV.19.6	For the Lord God,
REV.19.7	Let us rejoice and be glad 
REV.19.7	and give him the glory, 
REV.19.7	because the wedding celebration of the Lamb has come, 
REV.19.7	and his bride has prepared herself. 
REV.19.8	And it has been granted to her that she be dressed in bright, clean fine linen (for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints). 
REV.19.9	And he said to me, “Write: Blessed are those who are invited to the banquet of the wedding celebration of the Lamb!” And he said to me, “These are the true words of God.” 
REV.19.10	And I fell down before his feet to worship him, and he said to me, “Do not do that!
REV.19.11	And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and the one seated on it was called “Faithful” and “True,” and with justice
REV.19.12	Now his eyes were a flame of fire, and on his head were many royal headbands having a name written that no one except he himself knows. 
REV.19.13	And he was dressed in an outer garment dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God. 
REV.19.14	And the armies that are in heaven, dressed in clean, white fine linen, were following him on white horses. 
REV.19.15	And out of his mouth came a sharp sword, so that with it he could strike the nations. And he will shepherd them with an iron rod,
REV.19.16	And he has a name written on his outer garment and on his thigh: “King of kings and Lord of lords.” 
REV.19.17	And I saw one angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly directly overhead
REV.19.17	“Come! Assemble for the great banquet of God, 
REV.19.18	in order that you may eat the flesh of kings, 
REV.19.18	and the flesh of military tribunes, 
REV.19.18	and the flesh of the powerful, 
REV.19.18	and the flesh of horses and those seated on them, 
REV.19.18	and the flesh of all people, 
REV.19.18	both free and slave, 
REV.19.18	and small and great!” 
REV.19.19	And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war with the one who is seated on the horse and with his army. 
REV.19.20	And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed the signs before him, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who had worshiped his image. The two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulphur. 
REV.19.21	And the rest were killed by the sword of the one who is seated on the horse—the sword that comes out of his mouth—and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh. 
REV.20.1	 And I saw an angel descending from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. 
REV.20.2	And he seized the dragon—the ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan—and bound him for a thousand years, 
REV.20.3	and threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it above him, in order that he could not deceive the nations again until the thousand years are completed. After these things it is necessary for him to be released for a short time. 
REV.20.4	And I saw thrones, and they sat down on them, and authority to judge was granted to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and did not receive the mark on their
REV.20.5	(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed.) This is the first resurrection. 
REV.20.6	Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection. Over this person the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him a thousand
REV.20.7	And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison 
REV.20.8	and he will go out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to assemble them for battle, whose number
REV.20.9	And they went up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the fortified camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and consumed them. 
REV.20.10	And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulphur, where the beast and the false prophet also are, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever
REV.20.11	And I saw a great white throne and the one who was seated on it, from whose presence
REV.20.12	And I saw the dead—the great and the small—standing before the throne, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to their deeds. 
REV.20.13	And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and each one was judged according to their deeds. 
REV.20.14	And Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death—the lake of fire. 
REV.20.15	And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. 
REV.21.1	 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea did not exist any longer. 
REV.21.2	And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband. 
REV.21.3	And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 
REV.21.3	“Behold, the dwelling of God is with humanity, 
REV.21.3	and he will take up residence with them, 
REV.21.3	and they will be his people 
REV.21.3	and God himself will be with them.
REV.21.4	And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, 
REV.21.4	and death will not exist any longer, 
REV.21.4	and
REV.21.4	The former things
REV.21.5	And the one seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new!” And he said, “Write, because these words are faithful and true.” 
REV.21.6	And he said to me, “It is done! I am
REV.21.7	The one who conquers will inherit these things, and I will be his God
REV.21.8	But as for the cowards and unbelievers and detestable persons and murderers and sexually immoral people and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their share is in the lake that burns with fire and sulphur, which is the second death. 
REV.21.9	And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” 
REV.21.10	And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and lofty mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, 
REV.21.11	that has the glory of God. Its radiance is like a precious stone, something like a jasper stone, shining like crystal. 
REV.21.12	It has
REV.21.13	on the east, three gates, and on the north, three gates, and on the south, three gates, and on the west, three gates. 
REV.21.14	And the wall of the city has twelve foundations, and on them are twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 
REV.21.15	And the one who spoke with me was holding a golden measuring rod in order that he could measure the city and its gates and its wall. 
REV.21.16	And the city is laid out as a square, and its length is the same as its width. And he measured the city with the measuring rod at twelve thousand stadia;
REV.21.17	And he measured its wall, one hundred forty-four cubits
REV.21.18	And the material of its wall is jasper, and the city is pure gold, similar in appearance to pure glass. 
REV.21.19	The foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every kind of precious stone: the first foundation jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, 
REV.21.20	the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. 
REV.21.21	And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, each one of the gates was from a single pearl. And the street of the city is pure gold, like transparent glass. 
REV.21.22	And I did not see a temple in it, for the Lord God All-Powerful is its temple, and the Lamb. 
REV.21.23	And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon, that they shine on it, for the glory of God illuminates it, and its lamp is the Lamb. 
REV.21.24	And the nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. 
REV.21.25	And its gates will never be shut by day (for there will be no night there), 
REV.21.26	and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it. 
REV.21.27	And every unclean thing and one who practices
REV.22.1	 And he showed me the river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming out from the throne of God and of the Lamb 
REV.22.2	in the middle of its street, and on both sides of the river
REV.22.3	And there will not be any curse any longer, and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his slaves will serve
REV.22.4	and they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. 
REV.22.5	And night will not exist any longer, and they will not have need of the light of a lamp and the light
REV.22.6	And he said to me, “These words are faithful and true, and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his slaves the things which must take place in a short time.” 
REV.22.7	“And behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.” 
REV.22.8	And I, John, am the one who heard and who saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed these things to me. 
REV.22.9	And he said to me, “Do not do that!
REV.22.10	And he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near! 
REV.22.11	The one who does evil, let him do evil still, and the defiled, let him be defiled still, and the righteous, let him practice righteousness still, and the holy, let him be holy still.” 
REV.22.12	“Behold, I am coming quickly, and my reward is with me, to repay each one according to what his deeds are! 
REV.22.13	I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.” 
REV.22.14	Blessed are the ones who wash their robes, so that their authority will be over the tree of life and they may enter into the city through the gates. 
REV.22.15	Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the sexually immoral people and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and who practices falsehood. 
REV.22.16	“I, Jesus, sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.” 
REV.22.17	And the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And the one who hears, let him say, “Come!” And the one who is thirsty, let him come. The one who wants, let him take the water of life freely.
REV.22.18	I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues written in this book. 
REV.22.19	And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away his share of the tree of life and from the holy city that are written in this book. 
REV.22.20	The one who testifies about these things says, “Yes, I am coming quickly!” Amen! Come, Lord Jesus! 
REV.22.21	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all.
