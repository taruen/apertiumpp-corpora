GEN.1.1	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
GEN.1.2	The earth was 
GEN.1.3	Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. 
GEN.1.4	God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. 
GEN.1.5	God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.
GEN.1.6	Then God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.” 
GEN.1.7	God made the 
GEN.1.8	God called the expanse heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
GEN.1.9	Then God said, “Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so. 
GEN.1.10	God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas; and God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.11	Then God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, 
GEN.1.12	The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.13	There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
GEN.1.14	Then God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years; 
GEN.1.15	and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth”; and it was so. 
GEN.1.16	God made the two great lights, the greater light to govern the day, and the lesser light to govern the night; 
GEN.1.17	God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth, 
GEN.1.18	and to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.19	There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
GEN.1.20	Then God said, “Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens.” 
GEN.1.21	God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind; and God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.22	God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” 
GEN.1.23	There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
GEN.1.24	Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind”; and it was so. 
GEN.1.25	God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.26	Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” 
GEN.1.27	God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. 
GEN.1.28	God blessed them; and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” 
GEN.1.29	Then God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you; 
GEN.1.30	and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the sky and to every thing that moves on the earth which has life, 
GEN.1.31	God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
GEN.2.1	Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. 
GEN.2.2	By the seventh day God completed His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. 
GEN.2.3	Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.
GEN.2.4	This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the L
GEN.2.5	Now no shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the L
GEN.2.6	But a mist used to rise from the earth and water the whole surface of the ground. 
GEN.2.7	Then the L
GEN.2.8	The L
GEN.2.9	Out of the ground the L
GEN.2.10	Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it divided and became four rivers. 
GEN.2.11	The name of the first is Pishon; it flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. 
GEN.2.12	The gold of that land is good; the bdellium and the onyx stone are there. 
GEN.2.13	The name of the second river is Gihon; it flows around the whole land of Cush. 
GEN.2.14	The name of the third river is Tigris; it flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
GEN.2.15	Then the L
GEN.2.16	The L
GEN.2.17	but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die.”
GEN.2.18	Then the L
GEN.2.19	Out of the ground the L
GEN.2.20	The man gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the sky, and to every beast of the field, but for 
GEN.2.21	So the L
GEN.2.22	The L
GEN.2.23	The man said,
GEN.2.23	“This is now bone of my bones,
GEN.2.23	And flesh of my flesh;
GEN.2.23	She shall be called Woman,
GEN.2.23	Because she was taken out of Man.”
GEN.2.24	For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh. 
GEN.2.25	And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
GEN.3.1	Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the L
GEN.3.2	The woman said to the serpent, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 
GEN.3.3	but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.’ ” 
GEN.3.4	The serpent said to the woman, “You surely will not die! 
GEN.3.5	For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” 
GEN.3.6	When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make 
GEN.3.7	Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings.
GEN.3.8	They heard the sound of the L
GEN.3.9	Then the L
GEN.3.10	He said, “I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.” 
GEN.3.11	And He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?” 
GEN.3.12	The man said, “The woman whom You gave 
GEN.3.13	Then the L
GEN.3.14	The L
GEN.3.14	“Because you have done this,
GEN.3.14	Cursed are you more than all cattle,
GEN.3.14	And more than every beast of the field;
GEN.3.14	On your belly you will go,
GEN.3.14	And dust you will eat
GEN.3.14	All the days of your life;
GEN.3.15	And I will put enmity
GEN.3.15	Between you and the woman,
GEN.3.15	And between your seed and her seed;
GEN.3.15	He shall bruise you on the head,
GEN.3.15	And you shall bruise him on the heel.”
GEN.3.16	To the woman He said,
GEN.3.16	“I will greatly multiply
GEN.3.16	Your pain in childbirth,
GEN.3.16	In pain you will bring forth children;
GEN.3.16	Yet your desire will be for your husband,
GEN.3.16	And he will rule over you.”
GEN.3.17	Then to Adam He said, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it’;
GEN.3.17	Cursed is the ground because of you;
GEN.3.17	In toil you will eat of it
GEN.3.17	All the days of your life.
GEN.3.18	Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you;
GEN.3.18	And you will eat the plants of the field;
GEN.3.19	By the sweat of your face
GEN.3.19	You will eat bread,
GEN.3.19	Till you return to the ground,
GEN.3.19	Because from it you were taken;
GEN.3.19	For you are dust,
GEN.3.19	And to dust you shall return.”
GEN.3.20	Now the man called his wife’s name 
GEN.3.21	The L
GEN.3.22	Then the L
GEN.3.23	therefore the L
GEN.3.24	So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.
GEN.4.1	Now the man had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain, and she said, “I have gotten a manchild with 
GEN.4.2	Again, she gave birth to his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of flocks, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 
GEN.4.3	So it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to the L
GEN.4.4	Abel, on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the L
GEN.4.5	but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. So Cain became very angry and his countenance fell. 
GEN.4.6	Then the L
GEN.4.7	If you do well, will not 
GEN.4.8	Cain told Abel his brother. And it came about when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.
GEN.4.9	Then the L
GEN.4.10	He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to Me from the ground. 
GEN.4.11	Now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. 
GEN.4.12	When you cultivate the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you; you will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth.” 
GEN.4.13	Cain said to the L
GEN.4.14	Behold, You have driven me this day from the face of the ground; and from Your face I will be hidden, and I will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” 
GEN.4.15	So the L
GEN.4.16	Then Cain went out from the presence of the L
GEN.4.17	Cain had relations with his wife and she conceived, and gave birth to Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city Enoch, after the name of his son. 
GEN.4.18	Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad became the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael became the father of Methushael, and Methushael became the father of Lamech. 
GEN.4.19	Lamech took to himself two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other, Zillah. 
GEN.4.20	Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and 
GEN.4.21	His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe. 
GEN.4.22	As for Zillah, she also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of all implements of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
GEN.4.23	Lamech said to his wives,
GEN.4.23	“Adah and Zillah,
GEN.4.23	Listen to my voice,
GEN.4.23	You wives of Lamech,
GEN.4.23	Give heed to my speech,
GEN.4.23	For I have killed a man for wounding me;
GEN.4.23	And a boy for striking me;
GEN.4.24	If Cain is avenged sevenfold,
GEN.4.24	Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”
GEN.4.25	Adam had relations with his wife again; and she gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, for, 
GEN.4.26	To Seth, to him also a son was born; and he called his name Enosh. Then 
GEN.5.1	This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day when God created man, He made him in the likeness of God. 
GEN.5.2	He created them male and female, and He blessed them and named them 
GEN.5.3	When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he 
GEN.5.4	Then the days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he had 
GEN.5.5	So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.
GEN.5.6	Seth lived one hundred and five years, and became the father of Enosh. 
GEN.5.7	Then Seth lived eight hundred and seven years after he became the father of Enosh, and he had 
GEN.5.8	So all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.
GEN.5.9	Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan. 
GEN.5.10	Then Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years after he became the father of Kenan, and he had 
GEN.5.11	So all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, and he died.
GEN.5.12	Kenan lived seventy years, and became the father of Mahalalel. 
GEN.5.13	Then Kenan lived eight hundred and forty years after he became the father of Mahalalel, and he had 
GEN.5.14	So all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.
GEN.5.15	Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Jared. 
GEN.5.16	Then Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years after he became the father of Jared, and he had 
GEN.5.17	So all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.
GEN.5.18	Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and became the father of Enoch. 
GEN.5.19	Then Jared lived eight hundred years after he became the father of Enoch, and he had 
GEN.5.20	So all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.
GEN.5.21	Enoch lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Methuselah. 
GEN.5.22	Then Enoch walked with God three hundred years after he became the father of Methuselah, and he had 
GEN.5.23	So all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years. 
GEN.5.24	Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.
GEN.5.25	Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and became the father of Lamech. 
GEN.5.26	Then Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years after he became the father of Lamech, and he had 
GEN.5.27	So all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.
GEN.5.28	Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years, and became the father of a son. 
GEN.5.29	Now he called his name Noah, saying, “This one will give us rest from our work and from the toil of our hands 
GEN.5.30	Then Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years after he became the father of Noah, and he had 
GEN.5.31	So all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.
GEN.5.32	Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.1	Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them, 
GEN.6.2	that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose. 
GEN.6.3	Then the L
GEN.6.4	The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore 
GEN.6.5	Then the L
GEN.6.6	The L
GEN.6.7	The L
GEN.6.8	But Noah found favor in the eyes of the L
GEN.6.9	These are 
GEN.6.10	Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.11	Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God, and the earth was filled with violence. 
GEN.6.12	God looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
GEN.6.13	Then God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth. 
GEN.6.14	Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; you shall make the ark with rooms, and shall cover it inside and out with pitch. 
GEN.6.15	This is how you shall make it: the length of the ark three hundred 
GEN.6.16	You shall make a window for the ark, and finish it to a cubit from the top; and set the door of the ark in the side of it; you shall make it with lower, second, and third decks. 
GEN.6.17	Behold, I, even I am bringing the flood of water upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is on the earth shall perish. 
GEN.6.18	But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. 
GEN.6.19	And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every 
GEN.6.20	Of the birds after their kind, and of the animals after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every 
GEN.6.21	As for you, take for yourself some of all food which is edible, and gather 
GEN.6.22	Thus Noah did; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did.
GEN.7.1	Then the L
GEN.7.2	You shall take with you of every clean animal by sevens, a male and his female; and of the animals that are not clean two, a male and his female; 
GEN.7.3	also of the birds of the sky, by sevens, male and female, to keep offspring alive on the face of all the earth. 
GEN.7.4	For after seven more days, I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will blot out from the face of the land every living thing that I have made.” 
GEN.7.5	Noah did according to all that the L
GEN.7.6	Now Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of water came upon the earth. 
GEN.7.7	Then Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him entered the ark because of the water of the flood. 
GEN.7.8	Of clean animals and animals that are not clean and birds and everything that creeps on the ground, 
GEN.7.9	there went into the ark to Noah by twos, male and female, as God had commanded Noah. 
GEN.7.10	It came about after the seven days, that the water of the flood came upon the earth. 
GEN.7.11	In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the floodgates of the sky were opened. 
GEN.7.12	The rain fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights.
GEN.7.13	On the very same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark, 
GEN.7.14	they and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, all sorts of birds. 
GEN.7.15	So they went into the ark to Noah, by twos of all flesh in which was the breath of life. 
GEN.7.16	Those that entered, male and female of all flesh, entered as God had commanded him; and the L
GEN.7.17	Then the flood came upon the earth for forty days, and the water increased and lifted up the ark, so that it rose above the earth. 
GEN.7.18	The water prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water. 
GEN.7.19	The water prevailed more and more upon the earth, so that all the high mountains everywhere under the heavens were covered. 
GEN.7.20	The water prevailed fifteen cubits higher, and the mountains were covered. 
GEN.7.21	All flesh that moved on the earth perished, birds and cattle and beasts and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind; 
GEN.7.22	of all that was on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died. 
GEN.7.23	Thus He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky, and they were blotted out from the earth; and only Noah was left, together with those that were with him in the ark. 
GEN.7.24	The water prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days.
GEN.8.1	But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the water subsided. 
GEN.8.2	Also the fountains of the deep and the floodgates of the sky were closed, and the rain from the sky was restrained; 
GEN.8.3	and the water receded steadily from the earth, and at the end of one hundred and fifty days the water decreased. 
GEN.8.4	In the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat. 
GEN.8.5	The water decreased steadily until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains became visible.
GEN.8.6	Then it came about at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made; 
GEN.8.7	and he sent out a raven, and it flew here and there until the water was dried up from the earth. 
GEN.8.8	Then he sent out a dove from him, to see if the water was abated from the face of the land; 
GEN.8.9	but the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, so she returned to him into the ark, for the water was on the surface of all the earth. Then he put out his hand and took her, and brought her into the ark to himself. 
GEN.8.10	So he waited yet another seven days; and again he sent out the dove from the ark. 
GEN.8.11	The dove came to him toward evening, and behold, in her beak was a freshly picked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the water was abated from the earth. 
GEN.8.12	Then he waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; but she did not return to him again.
GEN.8.13	Now it came about in the six hundred and first year, in the first 
GEN.8.14	In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry. 
GEN.8.15	Then God spoke to Noah, saying, 
GEN.8.16	“Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons’ wives with you. 
GEN.8.17	Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you, birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.” 
GEN.8.18	So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him. 
GEN.8.19	Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by their families from the ark.
GEN.8.20	Then Noah built an altar to the L
GEN.8.21	The L
GEN.8.22	While the earth remains,
GEN.8.22	Seedtime and harvest,
GEN.8.22	And cold and heat,
GEN.8.22	And summer and winter,
GEN.8.22	And day and night
GEN.8.22	Shall not cease.”
GEN.9.1	And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. 
GEN.9.2	The fear of you and the terror of you will be on every beast of the earth and on every bird of the sky; with everything that creeps on the ground, and all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are given. 
GEN.9.3	Every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; I give all to you, as 
GEN.9.4	Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, 
GEN.9.5	Surely I will require your lifeblood; from every beast I will require it. And from 
GEN.9.6	Whoever sheds man’s blood,
GEN.9.6	By man his blood shall be shed,
GEN.9.6	For in the image of God
GEN.9.6	He made man.
GEN.9.7	As for you, be fruitful and multiply;
GEN.9.7	Populate the earth abundantly and multiply in it.”
GEN.9.8	Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, 
GEN.9.9	“Now behold, I Myself do establish My covenant with you, and with your descendants after you; 
GEN.9.10	and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that comes out of the ark, even every beast of the earth. 
GEN.9.11	I establish My covenant with you; and all flesh shall never again be cut off by the water of the flood, neither shall there again be a flood to destroy the earth.” 
GEN.9.12	God said, “This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all successive generations; 
GEN.9.13	I set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth. 
GEN.9.14	It shall come about, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow will be seen in the cloud, 
GEN.9.15	and I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and never again shall the water become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
GEN.9.16	When the bow is in the cloud, then I will look upon it, to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.” 
GEN.9.17	And God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth.”
GEN.9.18	Now the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth; and Ham was the father of Canaan. 
GEN.9.19	These three 
GEN.9.20	Then Noah began farming and planted a vineyard. 
GEN.9.21	He drank of the wine and became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent. 
GEN.9.22	Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. 
GEN.9.23	But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were turned away, so that they did not see their father’s nakedness. 
GEN.9.24	When Noah awoke from his wine, he knew what his youngest son had done to him. 
GEN.9.25	So he said,
GEN.9.25	“Cursed be Canaan;
GEN.9.25	He shall be to his brothers.”
GEN.9.26	He also said,
GEN.9.26	“Blessed be the L
GEN.9.26	The God of Shem;
GEN.9.26	And let Canaan be his servant.
GEN.9.27	May God enlarge Japheth,
GEN.9.27	And let him dwell in the tents of Shem;
GEN.9.27	And let Canaan be his servant.”
GEN.9.28	Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood. 
GEN.9.29	So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.
GEN.10.1	Now these are 
GEN.10.2	The sons of Japheth 
GEN.10.3	The sons of Gomer 
GEN.10.4	The sons of Javan 
GEN.10.5	From these the coastlands of the nations were separated into their lands, every one according to his language, according to their families, into their nations.
GEN.10.6	The sons of Ham 
GEN.10.7	The sons of Cush 
GEN.10.8	Now Cush became the father of Nimrod; he became a mighty one on the earth. 
GEN.10.9	He was a mighty hunter before the L
GEN.10.10	The beginning of his kingdom was 
GEN.10.11	From that land he went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh and Rehoboth-Ir and Calah, 
GEN.10.12	and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city. 
GEN.10.13	Mizraim became the father of Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim 
GEN.10.14	and Pathrusim and Casluhim (from which came the Philistines) and Caphtorim.
GEN.10.15	Canaan became the father of Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth 
GEN.10.16	and the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite 
GEN.10.17	and the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite 
GEN.10.18	and the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; and afterward the families of the Canaanite were spread abroad. 
GEN.10.19	The territory of the Canaanite extended from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 
GEN.10.20	These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, by their nations.
GEN.10.21	Also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, 
GEN.10.22	The sons of Shem 
GEN.10.23	The sons of Aram 
GEN.10.24	Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber. 
GEN.10.25	Two sons were born to Eber; the name of the one 
GEN.10.26	Joktan became the father of Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah 
GEN.10.27	and Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah 
GEN.10.28	and Obal and Abimael and Sheba 
GEN.10.29	and Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. 
GEN.10.30	Now their settlement extended from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the hill country of the east. 
GEN.10.31	These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, according to their nations.
GEN.10.32	These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, by their nations; and out of these the nations were separated on the earth after the flood.
GEN.11.1	Now the whole earth used the same language and the same words. 
GEN.11.2	It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. 
GEN.11.3	They said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks and burn 
GEN.11.4	They said, “Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top 
GEN.11.5	The L
GEN.11.6	The L
GEN.11.7	Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another’s speech.” 
GEN.11.8	So the L
GEN.11.9	Therefore its name was called 
GEN.11.10	These are 
GEN.11.11	and Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and he had 
GEN.11.12	Arpachshad lived thirty-five years, and became the father of Shelah; 
GEN.11.13	and Arpachshad lived four hundred and three years after he became the father of Shelah, and he had 
GEN.11.14	Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber; 
GEN.11.15	and Shelah lived four hundred and three years after he became the father of Eber, and he had 
GEN.11.16	Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg; 
GEN.11.17	and Eber lived four hundred and thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and he had 
GEN.11.18	Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu; 
GEN.11.19	and Peleg lived two hundred and nine years after he became the father of Reu, and he had 
GEN.11.20	Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug; 
GEN.11.21	and Reu lived two hundred and seven years after he became the father of Serug, and he had 
GEN.11.22	Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor; 
GEN.11.23	and Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and he had 
GEN.11.24	Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah; 
GEN.11.25	and Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and he had 
GEN.11.26	Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran.
GEN.11.27	Now these are 
GEN.11.28	Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 
GEN.11.29	Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah. 
GEN.11.30	Sarai was barren; she had no child.
GEN.11.31	Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went out together from Ur of the Chaldeans in order to enter the land of Canaan; and they went as far as Haran, and settled there. 
GEN.11.32	The days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.
GEN.12.1	Now the L
GEN.12.1	“Go forth from your country,
GEN.12.1	And from your relatives
GEN.12.1	And from your father’s house,
GEN.12.1	To the land which I will show you;
GEN.12.2	And I will make you a great nation,
GEN.12.2	And I will bless you,
GEN.12.2	And make your name great;
GEN.12.2	And so you shall be a blessing;
GEN.12.3	And I will bless those who bless you,
GEN.12.3	And the one who curses you I will curse.
GEN.12.3	And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.”
GEN.12.4	So Abram went forth as the L
GEN.12.5	Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his nephew, and all their possessions which they had accumulated, and the persons which they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan; thus they came to the land of Canaan. 
GEN.12.6	Abram passed through the land as far as the site of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. Now the Canaanite 
GEN.12.7	The L
GEN.12.8	Then he proceeded from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the L
GEN.12.9	Abram journeyed on, continuing toward the 
GEN.12.10	Now there was a famine in the land; so Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land. 
GEN.12.11	It came about when he came near to Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, “See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman; 
GEN.12.12	and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife’; and they will kill me, but they will let you live. 
GEN.12.13	Please say that you are my sister so that it may go well with me because of you, and that I may live on account of you.” 
GEN.12.14	It came about when Abram came into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. 
GEN.12.15	Pharaoh’s officials saw her and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. 
GEN.12.16	Therefore he treated Abram well for her sake; and gave him sheep and oxen and donkeys and male and female servants and female donkeys and camels.
GEN.12.17	But the L
GEN.12.18	Then Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? 
GEN.12.19	Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife, take her and go.” 
GEN.12.20	Pharaoh commanded 
GEN.13.1	So Abram went up from Egypt to the 
GEN.13.2	Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver and in gold. 
GEN.13.3	He went on his journeys from the 
GEN.13.4	to the place of the altar which he had made there formerly; and there Abram called on the name of the L
GEN.13.5	Now Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. 
GEN.13.6	And the land could not sustain them while dwelling together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to remain together. 
GEN.13.7	And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. Now the Canaanite and the Perizzite were dwelling then in the land.
GEN.13.8	So Abram said to Lot, “Please let there be no strife between you and me, nor between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers. 
GEN.13.9	Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me; if 
GEN.13.10	Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the valley of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere—
GEN.13.11	So Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed eastward. Thus they separated from each other. 
GEN.13.12	Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in the cities of the valley, and moved his tents as far as Sodom. 
GEN.13.13	Now the men of Sodom were wicked exceedingly and sinners against the L
GEN.13.14	The L
GEN.13.15	for all the land which you see, I will give it to you and to your descendants forever. 
GEN.13.16	I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth, so that if anyone can number the dust of the earth, then your descendants can also be numbered. 
GEN.13.17	Arise, walk about the land through its length and breadth; for I will give it to you.” 
GEN.13.18	Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the L
GEN.14.1	And it came about in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, 
GEN.14.2	 they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). 
GEN.14.3	All these came as allies to the valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea). 
GEN.14.4	Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
GEN.14.5	In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim and the Zuzim in Ham and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, 
GEN.14.6	and the Horites in their Mount Seir, as far as El-paran, which is by the wilderness. 
GEN.14.7	Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and conquered all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, who lived in Hazazon-tamar. 
GEN.14.8	And the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) came out; and they arrayed for battle against them in the valley of Siddim, 
GEN.14.9	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim and Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five. 
GEN.14.10	Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell into them. But those who survived fled to the hill country. 
GEN.14.11	Then they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food supply, and departed. 
GEN.14.12	They also took Lot, Abram’s nephew, and his possessions and departed, for he was living in Sodom.
GEN.14.13	Then a fugitive came and told Abram the Hebrew. Now he was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner, and these were allies with Abram. 
GEN.14.14	When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he led out his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. 
GEN.14.15	He divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them, and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus. 
GEN.14.16	He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative Lot with his possessions, and also the women, and the people.
GEN.14.17	Then after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley). 
GEN.14.18	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; now he was a priest of God Most High. 
GEN.14.19	He blessed him and said,
GEN.14.19	“Blessed be Abram of God Most High,
GEN.14.19	Possessor of heaven and earth;
GEN.14.20	And blessed be God Most High,
GEN.14.20	Who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”
GEN.14.20	He gave him a tenth of all. 
GEN.14.21	The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give the people to me and take the goods for yourself.” 
GEN.14.22	Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have sworn to the L
GEN.14.23	that I will not take a thread or a sandal thong or anything that is yours, for fear you would say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’ 
GEN.14.24	I will take nothing except what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their share.”
GEN.15.1	After these things the word of the L
GEN.15.1	“Do not fear, Abram,
GEN.15.1	I am a shield to you;
GEN.15.1	Your reward shall be very great.”
GEN.15.2	Abram said, “O Lord G
GEN.15.3	And Abram said, “Since You have given no offspring to me, one born in my house is my heir.” 
GEN.15.4	Then behold, the word of the L
GEN.15.5	And He took him outside and said, “Now look toward the heavens, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” And He said to him, “So shall your descendants be.” 
GEN.15.6	Then he believed in the L
GEN.15.7	And He said to him, “I am the L
GEN.15.8	He said, “O Lord G
GEN.15.9	So He said to him, “Bring Me a three year old heifer, and a three year old female goat, and a three year old ram, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” 
GEN.15.10	Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds. 
GEN.15.11	The birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
GEN.15.12	Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, terror 
GEN.15.13	 said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years. 
GEN.15.14	But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out with many possessions. 
GEN.15.15	As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age. 
GEN.15.16	Then in the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.”
GEN.15.17	It came about when the sun had set, that it was very dark, and behold, 
GEN.15.18	On that day the L
GEN.15.18	“To your descendants I have given this land,
GEN.15.18	From the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates:
GEN.15.19	the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite 
GEN.15.20	and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim 
GEN.15.21	and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite.”
GEN.16.1	Now Sarai, Abram’s wife had borne him no 
GEN.16.2	So Sarai said to Abram, “Now behold, the L
GEN.16.3	After Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Abram’s wife Sarai took Hagar the Egyptian, her maid, and gave her to her husband Abram as his wife. 
GEN.16.4	He went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her sight. 
GEN.16.5	And Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done me be upon you. I gave my maid into your arms, but when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her sight. May the L
GEN.16.6	But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your maid is in your power; do to her what is good in your sight.” So Sarai treated her harshly, and she fled from her presence.
GEN.16.7	Now the angel of the L
GEN.16.8	He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s maid, where have you come from and where are you going?” And she said, “I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.” 
GEN.16.9	Then the angel of the L
GEN.16.10	Moreover, the angel of the L
GEN.16.11	The angel of the L
GEN.16.11	“Behold, you are with child,
GEN.16.11	And you will bear a son;
GEN.16.11	And you shall call his name 
GEN.16.11	Because the L
GEN.16.12	He will be a wild donkey of a man,
GEN.16.12	His hand 
GEN.16.12	And everyone’s hand 
GEN.16.12	And he will live to the east of all his brothers.”
GEN.16.13	Then she called the name of the L
GEN.16.14	Therefore the well was called 
GEN.16.15	So Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. 
GEN.16.16	Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
GEN.17.1	Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the L
GEN.17.1	“I am God Almighty;
GEN.17.1	Walk before Me, and be blameless.
GEN.17.2	I will establish My covenant between Me and you,
GEN.17.2	And I will multiply you exceedingly.”
GEN.17.3	Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying,
GEN.17.4	“As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you,
GEN.17.4	And you will be the father of a multitude of nations.
GEN.17.5	No longer shall your name be called 
GEN.17.5	But your name shall be 
GEN.17.5	For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
GEN.17.6	I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings will come forth from you. 
GEN.17.7	I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you. 
GEN.17.8	I will give to you and to your descendants after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”
GEN.17.9	God said further to Abraham, “Now as for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. 
GEN.17.10	This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: every male among you shall be circumcised. 
GEN.17.11	And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you. 
GEN.17.12	And every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations, a 
GEN.17.13	A 
GEN.17.14	But an uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”
GEN.17.15	Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but 
GEN.17.16	I will bless her, and indeed I will give you a son by her. Then I will bless her, and she shall be 
GEN.17.17	Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear 
GEN.17.18	And Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before You!” 
GEN.17.19	But God said, “No, but Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you shall call his name 
GEN.17.20	As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him, and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. 
GEN.17.21	But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this season next year.” 
GEN.17.22	When He finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
GEN.17.23	Then Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all 
GEN.17.24	Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
GEN.17.25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
GEN.17.26	In the very same day Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son. 
GEN.17.27	All the men of his household, who were born in the house or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
GEN.18.1	Now the L
GEN.18.2	When he lifted up his eyes and looked, behold, three men were standing opposite him; and when he saw 
GEN.18.3	and said, “My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, please do not pass Your servant by. 
GEN.18.4	Please let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree; 
GEN.18.5	and I will bring a piece of bread, that you may refresh yourselves; after that you may go on, since you have visited your servant.” And they said, “So do, as you have said.” 
GEN.18.6	So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly, prepare three measures of fine flour, knead 
GEN.18.7	Abraham also ran to the herd, and took a tender and choice calf and gave 
GEN.18.8	He took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and placed 
GEN.18.9	Then they said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” And he said, “There, in the tent.” 
GEN.18.10	He said, “I will surely return to you at this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him. 
GEN.18.11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; Sarah was past childbearing. 
GEN.18.12	Sarah laughed to herself, saying, “After I have become old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?” 
GEN.18.13	And the L
GEN.18.14	Is anything too difficult for the L
GEN.18.15	Sarah denied 
GEN.18.16	Then the men rose up from there, and looked down toward Sodom; and Abraham was walking with them to send them off. 
GEN.18.17	The L

GEN.18.21	I will go down now, and see if they have done entirely according to its outcry, which has come to Me; and if not, I will know.”
GEN.18.22	Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom, while Abraham was still standing before the L
GEN.18.23	Abraham came near and said, “Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 
GEN.18.24	Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed sweep

GEN.19.1	Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw 
GEN.19.2	And he said, “Now behold, my lords, please turn aside into your servant’s house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way.” They said however, “No, but we shall spend the night in the square.” 
GEN.19.3	Yet he urged them strongly, so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he prepared a feast for them, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 
GEN.19.4	Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter; 
GEN.19.5	and they called to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them.” 
GEN.19.6	But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him, 
GEN.19.7	and said, “Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly. 
GEN.19.8	Now behold, I have two daughters who have not had relations with man; please let me bring them out to you, and do to them whatever you like; only do nothing to these men, inasmuch as they have come under the shelter of my roof.” 
GEN.19.9	But they said, “Stand aside.” Furthermore, they said, “This one came in as an alien, and already he is acting like a judge; now we will treat you worse than them.” So they pressed hard against Lot and came near to break the door. 
GEN.19.10	But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. 
GEN.19.11	They struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied 
GEN.19.12	Then the

GEN.19.15	When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.” 
GEN.19.16	But he hesitated. So the men seized his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, for the compassion of the L
GEN.19.17	When they had brought them outside, one said, “Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, and do not stay anywhere in the valley; escape to the mountains, or you will be swept away.” 
GEN.19.18	But Lot said to them, “Oh no, my lords! 
GEN.19.19	Now behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your lovingkindness, which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, for the disaster will overtake me and I will die; 
GEN.19.20	now behold, this town is near 
GEN.19.21	He said to him, “Behold, I grant you this request also, not to overthrow the town of which you have spoken. 
GEN.19.22	Hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there.” Therefore the name of the town was called

GEN.19.28	and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the valley, and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land ascended like the smoke of a furnace.
GEN.19.29	Thus it came about, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.
GEN.19.30	Lot went up from Zoar, and stayed in the mountains, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to stay in Zoar; and he stayed in a cave, he and his two daughters. 
GEN.19.31	Then the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of the earth. 
GEN.19.32	Come, let us make our father drink wine, and let us lie with him that we may preserve our family through our father.” 
GEN.19.33	So they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. 
GEN.19.34	On the following day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve our family through our father.” 
GEN.19.35	So they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger arose and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. 
GEN.19.36	Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father. 
GEN.19.37	The firstborn bore a son, and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day. 
GEN.19.38	As for the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; he is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day.
GEN.20.1	Now Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the 
GEN.20.2	Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. 
GEN.20.3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is married.” 
GEN.20.4	Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, “Lord, will You slay a nation, even 
GEN.20.5	Did he not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.” 
GEN.20.6	Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also kept you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her. 
GEN.20.7	Now therefore, restore the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore 
GEN.20.8	So Abimelech arose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were greatly frightened. 
GEN.20.9	Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.” 
GEN.20.10	And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What have you encountered, that you have done this thing?” 
GEN.20.11	Abraham said, “Because I thought, surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife. 
GEN.20.12	Besides, she actually is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife; 
GEN.20.13	and it came about, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said to her, ‘This is the kindness which you will show to me: everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.” ’ ” 
GEN.20.14	Abimelech then took sheep and oxen and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored his wife Sarah to him. 
GEN.20.15	Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you; settle wherever you please.” 
GEN.20.16	To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, it is your vindication before all who are with you, and before all men you are cleared.” 
GEN.20.17	Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maids, so that they bore 
GEN.20.18	For the L
GEN.21.1	Then the L
GEN.21.2	So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him. 
GEN.21.3	Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. 
GEN.21.4	Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. 
GEN.21.5	Now Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. 
GEN.21.6	Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.” 
GEN.21.7	And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”
GEN.21.8	The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
GEN.21.9	Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking. 
GEN.21.10	Therefore she said to Abraham, “Drive out this maid and her son, for the son of this maid shall not be an heir with my son Isaac.” 
GEN.21.11	The matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son. 
GEN.21.12	But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the lad and your maid; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac your descendants shall be named. 
GEN.21.13	And of the son of the maid I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant.” 
GEN.21.14	So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave 
GEN.21.15	When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes. 
GEN.21.16	Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, “Do not let me see the boy die.” And she sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice and wept. 
GEN.21.17	God heard the lad crying; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is. 
GEN.21.18	Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him.” 
GEN.21.19	Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the lad a drink.
GEN.21.20	God was with the lad, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer. 
GEN.21.21	He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
GEN.21.22	Now it came about at that time that Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do; 
GEN.21.23	now therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but according to the kindness that I have shown to you, you shall show to me and to the land in which you have sojourned.” 
GEN.21.24	Abraham said, “I swear it.” 
GEN.21.25	But Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well of water which the servants of Abimelech had seized. 
GEN.21.26	And Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor did I hear of it until today.”
GEN.21.27	Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant. 
GEN.21.28	Then Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 
GEN.21.29	Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe lambs mean, which you have set by themselves?” 
GEN.21.30	He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that it may be a witness to me, that I dug this well.” 
GEN.21.31	Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because there the two of them took an oath. 
GEN.21.32	So they made a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines. 
GEN.21.33	 planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the L
GEN.21.34	And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days.
GEN.22.1	Now it came about after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 
GEN.22.2	He said, “Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.” 
GEN.22.3	So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. 
GEN.22.4	On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from a distance. 
GEN.22.5	Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go over there; and we will worship and return to you.” 
GEN.22.6	Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together. 
GEN.22.7	Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” And he said, “Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” 
GEN.22.8	Abraham said, “God will provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” So the two of them walked on together.
GEN.22.9	Then they came to the place of which God had told him; and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 
GEN.22.10	Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. 
GEN.22.11	But the angel of the L
GEN.22.12	He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.” 
GEN.22.13	Then Abraham raised his eyes and looked, and behold, behind 
GEN.22.14	Abraham called the name of that place The L
GEN.22.15	Then the angel of the L
GEN.22.16	and said, “By Myself I have sworn, declares the L
GEN.22.17	indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies. 
GEN.22.18	In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.” 
GEN.22.19	So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham lived at Beersheba.
GEN.22.20	Now it came about after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, “Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor: 
GEN.22.21	Uz his firstborn and Buz his brother and Kemuel the father of Aram 
GEN.22.22	and Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel.” 
GEN.22.23	Bethuel became the father of Rebekah; these eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother. 
GEN.22.24	His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah.
GEN.23.1	Now Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; 
GEN.23.2	Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan; and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. 
GEN.23.3	Then Abraham rose from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying, 
GEN.23.4	“I am a stranger and a sojourner among you; give me a burial site among you that I may bury my dead out of my sight.” 
GEN.23.5	The sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, 
GEN.23.6	“Hear us, my lord, you are a mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our graves; none of us will refuse you his grave for burying your dead.” 
GEN.23.7	So Abraham rose and bowed to the people of the land, the sons of Heth. 
GEN.23.8	And he spoke with them, saying, “If it is your wish 
GEN.23.9	that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he owns, which is at the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in your presence for a burial site.” 
GEN.23.10	Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the sons of Heth; 
GEN.23.11	“No, my lord, hear me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you; bury your dead.” 
GEN.23.12	And Abraham bowed before the people of the land. 
GEN.23.13	He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, “If you will only please listen to me; I will give the price of the field, accept 
GEN.23.14	Then Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, 
GEN.23.15	“My lord, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you? So bury your dead.” 
GEN.23.16	Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, commercial standard.
GEN.23.17	So Ephron’s field, which was in Machpelah, which faced Mamre, the field and cave which was in it, and all the trees which were in the field, that were within all the confines of its border, were deeded over 
GEN.23.18	to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city. 
GEN.23.19	After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field at Machpelah facing Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.23.20	So the field and the cave that is in it, were deeded over to Abraham for a burial site by the sons of Heth.
GEN.24.1	Now Abraham was old, advanced in age; and the L
GEN.24.2	Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he owned, “Please place your hand under my thigh, 
GEN.24.3	and I will make you swear by the L
GEN.24.4	but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.” 
GEN.24.5	The servant said to him, “Suppose the woman is not willing to follow me to this land; should I take your son back to the land from where you came?” 
GEN.24.6	Then Abraham said to him, “Beware that you do not take my son back there! 
GEN.24.7	The L
GEN.24.8	But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this my oath; only do not take my son back there.” 
GEN.24.9	So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.
GEN.24.10	Then the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master, and set out with a variety of good things of his master’s in his hand; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor. 
GEN.24.11	He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, the time when women go out to draw water. 
GEN.24.12	He said, “O L
GEN.24.13	Behold, I am standing by the spring, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water; 
GEN.24.14	now may it be that the girl to whom I say, ‘Please let down your jar so that I may drink,’ and who answers, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels also’—
GEN.24.15	Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor, came out with her jar on her shoulder. 
GEN.24.16	The girl was very beautiful, a virgin, and no man had had relations with her; and she went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up. 
GEN.24.17	Then the servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar.” 
GEN.24.18	She said, “Drink, my lord”; and she quickly lowered her jar to her hand, and gave him a drink. 
GEN.24.19	Now when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will draw also for your camels until they have finished drinking.” 
GEN.24.20	So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, and ran back to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels. 
GEN.24.21	Meanwhile, the man was gazing at her in silence, to know whether the L
GEN.24.22	When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half-shekel and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels in gold, 
GEN.24.23	and said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room for us to lodge in your father’s house?” 
GEN.24.24	She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.” 
GEN.24.25	Again she said to him, “We have plenty of both straw and feed, and room to lodge in.” 
GEN.24.26	Then the man bowed low and worshiped the L
GEN.24.27	He said, “Blessed be the L
GEN.24.28	Then the girl ran and told her mother’s household about these things. 
GEN.24.29	Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran outside to the man at the spring. 
GEN.24.30	When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “This is what the man said to me,” he went to the man; and behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. 
GEN.24.31	And he said, “Come in, blessed of the L
GEN.24.32	So the man entered the house. Then Laban unloaded the camels, and he gave straw and feed to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 
GEN.24.33	But when 
GEN.24.34	So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant. 
GEN.24.35	The L
GEN.24.36	Now Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all that he has. 
GEN.24.37	My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live; 
GEN.24.38	but you shall go to my father’s house and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’ 
GEN.24.39	I said to my master, ‘Suppose the woman does not follow me.’ 
GEN.24.40	He said to me, ‘The L
GEN.24.41	then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my relatives; and if they do not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.’
GEN.24.42	“So I came today to the spring, and said, ‘O L
GEN.24.43	behold, I am standing by the spring, and may it be that the maiden who comes out to draw, and to whom I say, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar”; 
GEN.24.44	and she will say to me, “You drink, and I will draw for your camels also”; let her be the woman whom the L
GEN.24.45	“Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder, and went down to the spring and drew, and I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’ 
GEN.24.46	She quickly lowered her jar from her 
GEN.24.47	Then I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him’; and I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists. 
GEN.24.48	And I bowed low and worshiped the L
GEN.24.49	So now if you are going to 
GEN.24.50	Then Laban and Bethuel replied, “The matter comes from the L
GEN.24.51	Here is Rebekah before you, take 
GEN.24.52	When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the ground before the L
GEN.24.53	The servant brought out articles of silver and articles of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother. 
GEN.24.54	Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night. When they arose in the morning, he said, “Send me away to my master.” 
GEN.24.55	But her brother and her mother said, “Let the girl stay with us 
GEN.24.56	He said to them, “Do not delay me, since the L
GEN.24.57	And they said, “We will call the girl and consult her wishes.” 
GEN.24.58	Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.” 
GEN.24.59	Thus they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse with Abraham’s servant and his men. 
GEN.24.60	They blessed Rebekah and said to her,
GEN.24.60	“May you, our sister,
GEN.24.60	Become thousands of ten thousands,
GEN.24.60	And may your descendants possess
GEN.24.60	The gate of those who hate them.”
GEN.24.61	Then Rebekah arose with her maids, and they mounted the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed.
GEN.24.62	Now Isaac had come from going to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the Negev. 
GEN.24.63	Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, camels were coming. 
GEN.24.64	Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from the camel. 
GEN.24.65	She said to the servant, “Who is that man walking in the field to meet us?” And the servant said, “He is my master.” Then she took her veil and covered herself. 
GEN.24.66	The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. 
GEN.24.67	Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; thus Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
GEN.25.1	Now Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah. 
GEN.25.2	She bore to him Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim. 
GEN.25.4	The sons of Midian 
GEN.25.5	Now Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac; 
GEN.25.6	but to the sons of his concubines, Abraham gave gifts while he was still living, and sent them away from his son Isaac eastward, to the land of the east.
GEN.25.7	These are all the years of Abraham’s life that he lived, one hundred and seventy-five years. 
GEN.25.8	Abraham breathed his last and died in a ripe old age, an old man and satisfied 
GEN.25.9	Then his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, facing Mamre, 
GEN.25.10	the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth; there Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife. 
GEN.25.11	It came about after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac lived by Beer-lahai-roi.
GEN.25.12	Now these are 
GEN.25.13	and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael, and Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam 
GEN.25.14	and Mishma and Dumah and Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah. 
GEN.25.16	These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages, and by their camps; twelve princes according to their tribes. 
GEN.25.17	These are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people. 
GEN.25.18	They settled from Havilah to Shur which is east of Egypt as one goes toward Assyria; he settled in defiance of all his relatives.
GEN.25.19	Now these are 
GEN.25.20	and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife. 
GEN.25.21	Isaac prayed to the L
GEN.25.22	But the children struggled together within her; and she said, “If it is so, why then am I 
GEN.25.23	The L
GEN.25.23	“Two nations are in your womb;
GEN.25.23	And two peoples will be separated from your body;
GEN.25.23	And one people shall be stronger than the other;
GEN.25.23	And the older shall serve the younger.”
GEN.25.24	When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 
GEN.25.25	Now the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau. 
GEN.25.26	Afterward his brother came forth with his hand holding on to Esau’s heel, so his name was called 
GEN.25.27	When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field, but Jacob was a peaceful man, living in tents. 
GEN.25.28	Now Isaac loved Esau, because he had a taste for game, but Rebekah loved Jacob. 
GEN.25.29	When Jacob had cooked stew, Esau came in from the field and he was famished; 
GEN.25.30	and Esau said to Jacob, “Please let me have a swallow of that red stuff there, for I am famished.” Therefore his name was called 
GEN.25.31	But Jacob said, “First sell me your birthright.” 
GEN.25.32	Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die; so of what 
GEN.25.33	And Jacob said, “First swear to me”; so he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob. 
GEN.25.34	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew; and he ate and drank, and rose and went on his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
GEN.26.1	Now there was a famine in the land, besides the previous famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham. So Isaac went to Gerar, to Abimelech king of the Philistines. 
GEN.26.2	The L
GEN.26.3	Sojourn in this land and I will be with you and bless you, for to you and to your descendants I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to your father Abraham. 
GEN.26.4	I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and will give your descendants all these lands; and by your descendants all the nations of the earth shall be blessed; 
GEN.26.5	because Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes and My laws.”
GEN.26.6	So Isaac lived in Gerar. 
GEN.26.7	When the men of the place asked about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “my wife,” 
GEN.26.8	It came about, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out through a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac was caressing his wife Rebekah. 
GEN.26.9	Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, “Behold, certainly she is your wife! How then did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” And Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘I might die on account of her.’ ” 
GEN.26.10	Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.” 
GEN.26.11	So Abimelech charged all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”
GEN.26.12	Now Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. And the L
GEN.26.13	and the man became rich, and continued to grow richer until he became very wealthy; 
GEN.26.14	for he had possessions of flocks and herds and a great household, so that the Philistines envied him. 
GEN.26.15	Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped up by filling them with earth. 
GEN.26.16	Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are too powerful for us.” 
GEN.26.17	And Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there.
GEN.26.18	Then Isaac dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham; and he gave them the same names which his father had given them. 
GEN.26.19	But when Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of flowing water, 
GEN.26.20	the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac, saying, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek, because they contended with him. 
GEN.26.21	Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over it too, so he named it Sitnah. 
GEN.26.22	He moved away from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it; so he named it Rehoboth, for he said, “At last the L
GEN.26.23	Then he went up from there to Beersheba. 
GEN.26.24	The L
GEN.26.24	“I am the God of your father Abraham;
GEN.26.24	Do not fear, for I am with you.
GEN.26.24	I will bless you, and multiply your descendants,
GEN.26.24	For the sake of My servant Abraham.”
GEN.26.25	So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the L
GEN.26.26	Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with his adviser Ahuzzath and Phicol the commander of his army. 
GEN.26.27	Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?” 
GEN.26.28	They said, “We see plainly that the L
GEN.26.29	that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the L
GEN.26.30	Then he made them a feast, and they ate and drank. 
GEN.26.31	In the morning they arose early and exchanged oaths; then Isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace. 
GEN.26.32	Now it came about on the same day, that Isaac’s servants came in and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.” 
GEN.26.33	So he called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
GEN.26.34	When Esau was forty years old he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite; 
GEN.26.35	and they 
GEN.27.1	Now it came about, when Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called his older son Esau and said to him, “My son.” And he said to him, “Here I am.” 
GEN.27.2	Isaac said, “Behold now, I am old 
GEN.27.3	Now then, please take your gear, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me; 
GEN.27.4	and prepare a savory dish for me such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, so that my soul may bless you before I die.”
GEN.27.5	Rebekah was listening while Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game to bring 
GEN.27.6	Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Behold, I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, saying, 
GEN.27.7	‘Bring me 
GEN.27.8	Now therefore, my son, listen to me as I command you. 
GEN.27.9	Go now to the flock and bring me two choice young goats from there, that I may prepare them 
GEN.27.10	Then you shall bring 
GEN.27.11	Jacob answered his mother Rebekah, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man and I am a smooth man. 
GEN.27.12	Perhaps my father will feel me, then I will be as a deceiver in his sight, and I will bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing.” 
GEN.27.13	But his mother said to him, “Your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get 
GEN.27.14	So he went and got 
GEN.27.15	Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son. 
GEN.27.16	And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. 
GEN.27.17	She also gave the savory food and the bread, which she had made, to her son Jacob.
GEN.27.18	Then he came to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?” 
GEN.27.19	Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn; I have done as you told me. Get up, please, sit and eat of my game, that you may bless me.” 
GEN.27.20	Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have 
GEN.27.21	Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come close, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.” 
GEN.27.22	So Jacob came close to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” 
GEN.27.23	He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him. 
GEN.27.24	And he said, “Are you really my son Esau?” And he said, “I am.” 
GEN.27.25	So he said, “Bring 
GEN.27.26	Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come close and kiss me, my son.” 
GEN.27.27	So he came close and kissed him; and when he smelled the smell of his garments, he blessed him and said,
GEN.27.27	“See, the smell of my son
GEN.27.27	Is like the smell of a field which the L
GEN.27.28	Now may God give you of the dew of heaven,
GEN.27.28	And of the fatness of the earth,
GEN.27.28	And an abundance of grain and new wine;
GEN.27.29	May peoples serve you,
GEN.27.29	And nations bow down to you;
GEN.27.29	Be master of your brothers,
GEN.27.29	And may your mother’s sons bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	Cursed be those who curse you,
GEN.27.29	And blessed be those who bless you.”
GEN.27.30	Now it came about, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had hardly gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
GEN.27.31	Then he also made savory food, and brought it to his father; and he said to his father, “Let my father arise and eat of his son’s game, that you may bless me.” 
GEN.27.32	Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?” And he said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.” 
GEN.27.33	Then Isaac trembled violently, and said, “Who was he then that hunted game and brought 
GEN.27.34	When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, 
GEN.27.35	And he said, “Your brother came deceitfully and has taken away your blessing.” 
GEN.27.36	Then he said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob, for he has supplanted me these two times? He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.” And he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?” 
GEN.27.37	But Isaac replied to Esau, “Behold, I have made him your master, and all his relatives I have given to him as servants; and with grain and new wine I have sustained him. Now as for you then, what can I do, my son?” 
GEN.27.38	Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me, 
GEN.27.39	Then Isaac his father answered and said to him,
GEN.27.39	“Behold, away from the fertility of the earth shall be your dwelling,
GEN.27.39	And away from the dew of heaven from above.
GEN.27.40	By your sword you shall live,
GEN.27.40	And your brother you shall serve;
GEN.27.40	But it shall come about when you become restless,
GEN.27.40	That you will break his yoke from your neck.”
GEN.27.41	So Esau bore a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him; and Esau said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.” 
GEN.27.42	Now when the words of her elder son Esau were reported to Rebekah, she sent and called her younger son Jacob, and said to him, “Behold your brother Esau is consoling himself concerning you 
GEN.27.43	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, and arise, flee to Haran, to my brother Laban! 
GEN.27.44	Stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury subsides, 
GEN.27.45	until your brother’s anger against you subsides and he forgets what you did to him. Then I will send and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?”
GEN.27.46	Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am tired of living because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth, like these, from the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?”
GEN.28.1	So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him, and said to him, “You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. 
GEN.28.2	Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father; and from there take to yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban your mother’s brother. 
GEN.28.3	May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples. 
GEN.28.4	May He also give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your descendants with you, that you may possess the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham.” 
GEN.28.5	Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
GEN.28.6	Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take to himself a wife from there, 
GEN.28.7	and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan-aram. 
GEN.28.8	So Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan displeased his father Isaac; 
GEN.28.9	and Esau went to Ishmael, and married, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth.
GEN.28.10	Then Jacob departed from Beersheba and went toward Haran. 
GEN.28.11	He came to a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set; and he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head, and lay down in that place. 
GEN.28.12	He had a dream, and behold, a ladder was set on the earth with its top reaching to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. 
GEN.28.13	And behold, the L
GEN.28.14	Your descendants will also be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and in you and in your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed. 
GEN.28.15	Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” 
GEN.28.16	Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the L
GEN.28.17	He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”
GEN.28.18	So Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on its top. 
GEN.28.19	He called the name of that place 
GEN.28.20	Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will keep me on this journey that I take, and will give me food to eat and garments to wear, 
GEN.28.21	and I return to my father’s house in safety, then the L
GEN.28.22	This stone, which I have set up as a pillar, will be God’s house, and of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You.”
GEN.29.1	Then Jacob 
GEN.29.2	He looked, and saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it, for from that well they watered the flocks. Now the stone on the mouth of the well was large. 
GEN.29.3	When all the flocks were gathered there, they would then roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the mouth of the well.
GEN.29.4	Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where are you from?” And they said, “We are from Haran.” 
GEN.29.5	He said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?” And they said, “We know 
GEN.29.6	And he said to them, “Is it well with him?” And they said, “It is well, and here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep.” 
GEN.29.7	He said, “Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered. Water the sheep, and go, pasture them.” 
GEN.29.8	But they said, “We cannot, until all the flocks are gathered, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.”
GEN.29.9	While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. 
GEN.29.10	When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, Jacob went up and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother. 
GEN.29.11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted his voice and wept. 
GEN.29.12	Jacob told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and that he was Rebekah’s son, and she ran and told her father.
GEN.29.13	So when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Then he related to Laban all these things. 
GEN.29.14	Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” And he stayed with him a month.
GEN.29.15	Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?” 
GEN.29.16	Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
GEN.29.17	And Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful of form and face. 
GEN.29.18	Now Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.” 
GEN.29.19	Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than to give her to another man; stay with me.” 
GEN.29.20	So Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed to him but a few days because of his love for her.
GEN.29.21	Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give 
GEN.29.22	Laban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast. 
GEN.29.23	Now in the evening he took his daughter Leah, and brought her to him; and 
GEN.29.24	Laban also gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as a maid. 
GEN.29.25	So it came about in the morning that, behold, it was Leah! And he said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served with you? Why then have you deceived me?” 
GEN.29.26	But Laban said, “It is not the practice in our place to marry off the younger before the firstborn. 
GEN.29.27	Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you shall serve with me for another seven years.” 
GEN.29.28	Jacob did so and completed her week, and he gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife. 
GEN.29.29	Laban also gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maid. 
GEN.29.30	So 
GEN.29.31	Now the L
GEN.29.32	Leah conceived and bore a son and named him Reuben, for she said, “Because the L
GEN.29.33	Then she conceived again and bore a son and said, “Because the L
GEN.29.34	She conceived again and bore a son and said, “Now this time my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore he was named Levi. 
GEN.29.35	And she conceived again and bore a son and said, “This time I will praise the L
GEN.30.1	Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she became jealous of her sister; and she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I die.” 
GEN.30.2	Then Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?” 
GEN.30.3	She said, “Here is my maid Bilhah, go in to her that she may bear on my knees, that through her I too may have children.” 
GEN.30.4	So she gave him her maid Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her. 
GEN.30.5	Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.6	Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me, and has indeed heard my voice and has given me a son.” Therefore she named him Dan. 
GEN.30.7	Rachel’s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.8	So Rachel said, “With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, 
GEN.30.9	When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife. 
GEN.30.10	Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.11	Then Leah said, “How fortunate!” So she named him Gad. 
GEN.30.12	Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.13	Then Leah said, “Happy am I! For women will call me happy.” So she named him Asher.
GEN.30.14	Now in the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.” 
GEN.30.15	But she said to her, “Is it a small matter for you to take my husband? And would you take my son’s mandrakes also?” So Rachel said, “Therefore he may lie with you tonight in return for your son’s mandrakes.” 
GEN.30.16	When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, then Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he lay with her that night. 
GEN.30.17	God gave heed to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son. 
GEN.30.18	Then Leah said, “God has given me my wages because I gave my maid to my husband.” So she named him Issachar. 
GEN.30.19	Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to Jacob. 
GEN.30.20	Then Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good gift; now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun. 
GEN.30.21	Afterward she bore a daughter and named her Dinah.
GEN.30.22	Then God remembered Rachel, and God gave heed to her and opened her womb. 
GEN.30.23	So she conceived and bore a son and said, “God has taken away my reproach.” 
GEN.30.24	She named him Joseph, saying, “May the L
GEN.30.25	Now it came about when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own country. 
GEN.30.26	Give 
GEN.30.27	But Laban said to him, “If now 
GEN.30.28	He continued, “Name me your wages, and I will give it.” 
GEN.30.29	But he said to him, “You yourself know how I have served you and how your cattle have fared with me. 
GEN.30.30	For you had little before I came and it has increased to a multitude, and the L
GEN.30.31	So he said, “What shall I give you?” And Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this 
GEN.30.32	let me pass through your entire flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted sheep and every black one among the lambs and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and 
GEN.30.33	So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come concerning my wages. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, 
GEN.30.34	Laban said, “Good, let it be according to your word.” 
GEN.30.35	So he removed on that day the striped and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats, every one with white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons. 
GEN.30.36	And he put 
GEN.30.37	Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white which 
GEN.30.38	He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the gutters, 
GEN.30.39	So the flocks mated by the rods, and the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted. 
GEN.30.40	Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own herds apart, and did not put them with Laban’s flock. 
GEN.30.41	Moreover, whenever the stronger of the flock were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the gutters, so that they might mate by the rods; 
GEN.30.42	but when the flock was feeble, he did not put 
GEN.30.43	So the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks and female and male servants and camels and donkeys.
GEN.31.1	Now Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s, and from what belonged to our father he has made all this wealth.” 
GEN.31.2	Jacob saw the 
GEN.31.3	Then the L
GEN.31.4	So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to his flock in the field, 
GEN.31.5	and said to them, “I see your father’s attitude, that it is not 
GEN.31.6	You know that I have served your father with all my strength. 
GEN.31.7	Yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times; however, God did not allow him to hurt me. 
GEN.31.8	If he spoke thus, ‘The speckled shall be your wages,’ then all the flock brought forth speckled; and if he spoke thus, ‘The striped shall be your wages,’ then all the flock brought forth striped. 
GEN.31.9	Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock and given 
GEN.31.10	And it came about at the time when the flock were mating that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which were mating 
GEN.31.11	Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’ 
GEN.31.12	He said, ‘Lift up now your eyes and see 
GEN.31.13	I am the God 
GEN.31.14	Rachel and Leah said to him, “Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father’s house? 
GEN.31.15	Are we not reckoned by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also entirely consumed our purchase price. 
GEN.31.16	Surely all the wealth which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and our children; now then, do whatever God has said to you.”
GEN.31.17	Then Jacob arose and put his children and his wives upon camels; 
GEN.31.18	and he drove away all his livestock and all his property which he had gathered, his acquired livestock which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac. 
GEN.31.19	When Laban had gone to shear his flock, then Rachel stole the household idols that were her father’s. 
GEN.31.20	And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was fleeing. 
GEN.31.21	So he fled with all that he had; and he arose and crossed the 
GEN.31.22	When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled, 
GEN.31.23	then he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him 
GEN.31.24	God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night and said to him, “Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.”
GEN.31.25	Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen camped in the hill country of Gilead. 
GEN.31.26	Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done by deceiving me and carrying away my daughters like captives of the sword? 
GEN.31.27	Why did you flee secretly and deceive me, and did not tell me so that I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with timbrel and with lyre; 
GEN.31.28	and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now you have done foolishly. 
GEN.31.29	It is in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful not to speak either good or bad to Jacob.’ 
GEN.31.30	Now you have indeed gone away because you longed greatly for your father’s house; 
GEN.31.31	Then Jacob replied to Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force. 
GEN.31.32	The one with whom you find your gods shall not live; in the presence of our kinsmen point out what is yours among my belongings and take 
GEN.31.33	So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent and into the tent of the two maids, but he did not find 
GEN.31.34	Now Rachel had taken the household idols and put them in the camel’s saddle, and she sat on them. And Laban felt through all the tent but did not find 
GEN.31.35	She said to her father, “Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the manner of women is upon me.” So he searched but did not find the household idols.
GEN.31.36	Then Jacob became angry and contended with Laban; and Jacob said to Laban, “What is my transgression? What is my sin that you have hotly pursued me? 
GEN.31.37	Though you have felt through all my goods, what have you found of all your household goods? Set 
GEN.31.38	These twenty years I 
GEN.31.39	That which was torn 
GEN.31.40	 I was: by day the heat consumed me and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes. 
GEN.31.41	These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you changed my wages ten times. 
GEN.31.42	If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had not been for me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, so He rendered judgment last night.”
GEN.31.43	Then Laban replied to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne? 
GEN.31.44	So now come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it be a witness between you and me.” 
GEN.31.45	Then Jacob took a stone and set it up 
GEN.31.46	Jacob said to his kinsmen, “Gather stones.” So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap. 
GEN.31.47	Now Laban called it 
GEN.31.48	Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me this day.” Therefore it was named Galeed, 
GEN.31.49	and 
GEN.31.50	If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, 
GEN.31.51	Laban said to Jacob, “Behold this heap and behold the pillar which I have set between you and me. 
GEN.31.52	This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass by this heap to you for harm, and you will not pass by this heap and this pillar to me, for harm. 
GEN.31.53	The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac. 
GEN.31.54	Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his kinsmen to the meal; and they ate the meal and spent the night on the mountain. 
GEN.31.55	Early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned to his place.
GEN.32.1	Now as Jacob went on his way, the angels of God met him. 
GEN.32.2	Jacob said when he saw them, “This is God’s 
GEN.32.3	Then Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 
GEN.32.4	He also commanded them saying, “Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: ‘Thus says your servant Jacob, “I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now; 
GEN.32.5	I have oxen and donkeys 
GEN.32.6	The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau, and furthermore he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.” 
GEN.32.7	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and the herds and the camels, into two companies; 
GEN.32.8	for he said, “If Esau comes to the one company and attacks it, then the company which is left will escape.”
GEN.32.9	Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O L
GEN.32.10	I am unworthy of all the lovingkindness and of all the faithfulness which You have shown to Your servant; for with my staff 
GEN.32.11	Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, that he will come and attack me 
GEN.32.12	For You said, ‘I will surely prosper you and make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which is too great to be numbered.’ ”
GEN.32.13	So he spent the night there. Then he selected from what he had with him a present for his brother Esau: 
GEN.32.14	two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
GEN.32.15	thirty milking camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. 
GEN.32.16	He delivered 
GEN.32.17	He commanded the one in front, saying, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, saying, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do these 
GEN.32.18	then you shall say, ‘
GEN.32.19	Then he commanded also the second and the third, and all those who followed the droves, saying, “After this manner you shall speak to Esau when you find him; 
GEN.32.20	and you shall say, ‘Behold, your servant Jacob also is behind us.’ ” For he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before me. Then afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.” 
GEN.32.21	So the present passed on before him, while he himself spent that night in the camp.
GEN.32.22	Now he arose that same night and took his two wives and his two maids and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. 
GEN.32.23	He took them and sent them across the stream. And he sent across whatever he had.
GEN.32.24	Then Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak. 
GEN.32.25	When he saw that he had not prevailed against him, he touched the socket of his thigh; so the socket of Jacob’s thigh was dislocated while he wrestled with him. 
GEN.32.26	Then he said, “Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.” But he said, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.” 
GEN.32.27	So he said to him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.” 
GEN.32.28	He said, “Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but 
GEN.32.29	Then Jacob asked him and said, “Please tell me your name.” But he said, “Why is it that you ask my name?” And he blessed him there. 
GEN.32.30	So Jacob named the place 
GEN.32.31	Now the sun rose upon him just as he crossed over Penuel, and he was limping on his thigh. 
GEN.32.32	Therefore, to this day the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip which is on the socket of the thigh, because he touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.
GEN.33.1	Then Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids. 
GEN.33.2	He put the maids and their children in front, and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last. 
GEN.33.3	But he himself passed on ahead of them and bowed down to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
GEN.33.4	Then Esau ran to meet him and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept. 
GEN.33.5	He lifted his eyes and saw the women and the children, and said, “Who are these with you?” So he said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.” 
GEN.33.6	Then the maids came near with their children, and they bowed down. 
GEN.33.7	Leah likewise came near with her children, and they bowed down; and afterward Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed down. 
GEN.33.8	And he said, “What do you mean by all this company which I have met?” And he said, “To find favor in the sight of my lord.” 
GEN.33.9	But Esau said, “I have plenty, my brother; let what you have be your own.” 
GEN.33.10	Jacob said, “No, please, if now I have found favor in your sight, then take my present from my hand, for I see your face as one sees the face of God, and you have received me favorably. 
GEN.33.11	Please take my gift which has been brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me and because I have plenty.” Thus he urged him and he took 
GEN.33.12	Then Esau said, “Let us take our journey and go, and I will go before you.” 
GEN.33.13	But he said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds which are nursing are a care to me. And if they are driven hard one day, all the flocks will die. 
GEN.33.14	Please let my lord pass on before his servant, and I will proceed at my leisure, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord at Seir.”
GEN.33.15	Esau said, “Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “
GEN.33.16	So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. 
GEN.33.17	Jacob journeyed to 
GEN.33.18	Now Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram, and camped before the city. 
GEN.33.19	He bought the piece of land where he had pitched his tent from the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money. 
GEN.33.20	Then he erected there an altar and called it 
GEN.34.1	Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land. 
GEN.34.2	When Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he took her and lay with her by force. 
GEN.34.3	He was deeply attracted to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her. 
GEN.34.4	So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, “Get me this young girl for a wife.” 
GEN.34.5	Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; but his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob kept silent until they came in. 
GEN.34.6	Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him. 
GEN.34.7	Now the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard 
GEN.34.8	But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter; please give her to him in marriage. 
GEN.34.9	Intermarry with us; give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves. 
GEN.34.10	Thus you shall live with us, and the land shall be 
GEN.34.11	Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, “If I find favor in your sight, then I will give whatever you say to me. 
GEN.34.12	Ask me ever so much bridal payment and gift, and I will give according as you say to me; but give me the girl in marriage.”
GEN.34.13	But Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor with deceit, because he had defiled Dinah their sister. 
GEN.34.14	They said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us. 
GEN.34.15	Only on this 
GEN.34.16	then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will live with you and become one people. 
GEN.34.17	But if you will not listen to us to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go.”
GEN.34.18	Now their words seemed reasonable to Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son. 
GEN.34.19	The young man did not delay to do the thing, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter. Now he was more respected than all the household of his father. 
GEN.34.20	So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying, 
GEN.34.21	“These men are friendly with us; therefore let them live in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters in marriage, and give our daughters to them. 
GEN.34.22	Only on this 
GEN.34.23	Will not their livestock and their property and all their animals be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will live with us.” 
GEN.34.24	All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
GEN.34.25	Now it came about on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword and came upon the city unawares, and killed every male. 
GEN.34.26	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah from Shechem’s house, and went forth. 
GEN.34.27	Jacob’s sons came upon the slain and looted the city, because they had defiled their sister. 
GEN.34.28	They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys, and that which was in the city and that which was in the field; 
GEN.34.29	and they captured and looted all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives, even all that 
GEN.34.30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and my men being few in number, they will gather together against me and attack me and I will be destroyed, I and my household.” 
GEN.34.31	But they said, “Should he treat our sister as a harlot?”
GEN.35.1	Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel and live there, and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.” 
GEN.35.2	So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods which are among you, and purify yourselves and change your garments; 
GEN.35.3	and let us arise and go up to Bethel, and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.” 
GEN.35.4	So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which they had and the rings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak which was near Shechem.
GEN.35.5	As they journeyed, there was a great terror upon the cities which were around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. 
GEN.35.6	So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him. 
GEN.35.7	He built an altar there, and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed Himself to him when he fled from his brother. 
GEN.35.8	Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; it was named 
GEN.35.9	Then God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him. 
GEN.35.10	God said to him,
GEN.35.10	“Your name is Jacob;
GEN.35.10	You shall no longer be called Jacob,
GEN.35.10	But Israel shall be your name.”
GEN.35.10	Thus He called him Israel. 
GEN.35.11	God also said to him,
GEN.35.11	“I am God Almighty;
GEN.35.11	Be fruitful and multiply;
GEN.35.11	A nation and a company of nations shall come from you,
GEN.35.11	And kings shall come forth from you.
GEN.35.12	The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac,
GEN.35.12	I will give it to you,
GEN.35.12	And I will give the land to your descendants after you.”
GEN.35.13	Then God went up from him in the place where He had spoken with him. 
GEN.35.14	Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it. 
GEN.35.15	So Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him, 
GEN.35.16	Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and she suffered severe labor. 
GEN.35.17	When she was in severe labor the midwife said to her, “Do not fear, for now you have another son.” 
GEN.35.18	It came about as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him 
GEN.35.19	So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 
GEN.35.20	Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; that is the pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day. 
GEN.35.21	Then Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
GEN.35.22	It came about while Israel was dwelling in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine, and Israel heard 
GEN.35.23	the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, then Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun; 
GEN.35.24	the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin; 
GEN.35.25	and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maid: Dan and Naphtali; 
GEN.35.26	and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
GEN.35.27	Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre of Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.
GEN.35.28	Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years. 
GEN.35.29	Isaac breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, an old man of ripe age; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
GEN.36.1	Now these are 
GEN.36.2	Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 
GEN.36.3	also Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, the sister of Nebaioth. 
GEN.36.4	Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel, 
GEN.36.5	and Oholibamah bore Jeush and Jalam and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
GEN.36.6	Then Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all his household, and his livestock and all his cattle and all his goods which he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to 
GEN.36.7	For their property had become too great for them to live together, and the land where they sojourned could not sustain them because of their livestock. 
GEN.36.8	So Esau lived in the hill country of Seir; Esau is Edom.
GEN.36.9	These then are 
GEN.36.10	These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz the son of Esau’s wife Adah, Reuel the son of Esau’s wife Basemath. 
GEN.36.11	The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho and Gatam and Kenaz. 
GEN.36.12	Timna was a concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These are the sons of Esau’s wife Adah. 
GEN.36.13	These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath and Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esau’s wife Basemath. 
GEN.36.14	These were the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon: she bore to Esau, Jeush and Jalam and Korah.
GEN.36.15	These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau, are chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz, 
GEN.36.16	chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah. 
GEN.36.17	These are the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs descended from Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Esau’s wife Basemath. 
GEN.36.18	These are the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah. 
GEN.36.19	These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.
GEN.36.20	These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah, 
GEN.36.21	and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan. These are the chiefs descended from the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom. 
GEN.36.22	The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan’s sister was Timna. 
GEN.36.23	These are the sons of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam. 
GEN.36.24	These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah—he is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness when he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon. 
GEN.36.25	These are the children of Anah: Dishon, and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah. 
GEN.36.26	These are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran. 
GEN.36.27	These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan. 
GEN.36.28	These are the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran. 
GEN.36.29	These are the chiefs descended from the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah, 
GEN.36.30	chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan. These are the chiefs descended from the Horites, according to their 
GEN.36.31	Now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the sons of Israel. 
GEN.36.32	Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 
GEN.36.33	Then Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah became king in his place. 
GEN.36.34	Then Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites became king in his place. 
GEN.36.35	Then Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the field of Moab, became king in his place; and the name of his city was Avith. 
GEN.36.36	Then Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah became king in his place. 
GEN.36.37	Then Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth on the 
GEN.36.38	Then Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor became king in his place. 
GEN.36.39	Then Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar became king in his place; and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezahab.
GEN.36.40	Now these are the names of the chiefs descended from Esau, according to their families 
GEN.36.41	chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon, 
GEN.36.42	chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar, 
GEN.36.43	chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom (that is, Esau, the father of the Edomites), according to their habitations in the land of their possession.
GEN.37.1	Now Jacob lived in the land where his father had sojourned, in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.37.2	These are 
GEN.37.3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a 
GEN.37.4	His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers; and 
GEN.37.5	Then Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more. 
GEN.37.6	He said to them, “Please listen to this dream which I have had; 
GEN.37.7	for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf rose up and also stood erect; and behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf.” 
GEN.37.8	Then his brothers said to him, “Are you actually going to reign over us? Or are you really going to rule over us?” So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
GEN.37.9	Now he had still another dream, and related it to his brothers, and said, “Lo, I have had still another dream; and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” 
GEN.37.10	He related 
GEN.37.11	His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying 
GEN.37.12	Then his brothers went to pasture their father’s flock in Shechem. 
GEN.37.13	Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing 
GEN.37.14	Then he said to him, “Go now and see about the welfare of your brothers and the welfare of the flock, and bring word back to me.” So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
GEN.37.15	A man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field; and the man asked him, “What are you looking for?” 
GEN.37.16	He said, “I am looking for my brothers; please tell me where they are pasturing 
GEN.37.17	Then the man said, “They have moved from here; for I heard 
GEN.37.18	When they saw him from a distance and before he came close to them, they plotted against him to put him to death. 
GEN.37.19	They said to one another, “Here comes this dreamer! 
GEN.37.20	Now then, come and let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; and we will say, ‘A wild beast devoured him.’ Then let us see what will become of his dreams!” 
GEN.37.21	But Reuben heard 
GEN.37.22	Reuben further said to them, “Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but do not lay hands on him”—that he might rescue him out of their hands, to restore him to his father. 
GEN.37.23	So it came about, when Joseph reached his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the varicolored tunic that was on him; 
GEN.37.24	and they took him and threw him into the pit. Now the pit was empty, without any water in it.
GEN.37.25	Then they sat down to eat a meal. And as they raised their eyes and looked, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing aromatic gum and balm and myrrh, on their way to bring 
GEN.37.26	Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it for us to kill our brother and cover up his blood? 
GEN.37.27	Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him, for he is our brother, our 
GEN.37.28	Then some Midianite traders passed by, so they pulled 
GEN.37.29	Now Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph was not in the pit; so he tore his garments. 
GEN.37.30	He returned to his brothers and said, “The boy is not 
GEN.37.31	So they took Joseph’s tunic, and slaughtered a male goat and dipped the tunic in the blood; 
GEN.37.32	and they sent the varicolored tunic and brought it to their father and said, “We found this; please examine 
GEN.37.33	Then he examined it and said, “It is my son’s tunic. A wild beast has devoured him; Joseph has surely been torn to pieces!” 
GEN.37.34	So Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days. 
GEN.37.35	Then all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. And he said, “Surely I will go down to Sheol in mourning for my son.” So his father wept for him. 
GEN.37.36	Meanwhile, the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, Pharaoh’s officer, the captain of the bodyguard.
GEN.38.1	And it came about at that time, that Judah departed from his brothers and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 
GEN.38.2	Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and he took her and went in to her. 
GEN.38.3	So she conceived and bore a son and he named him Er. 
GEN.38.4	Then she conceived again and bore a son and named him Onan. 
GEN.38.5	She bore still another son and named him Shelah; and it was at Chezib that she bore him.
GEN.38.6	Now Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name 
GEN.38.7	But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was evil in the sight of the L
GEN.38.8	Then Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform your duty as a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.” 
GEN.38.9	Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so when he went in to his brother’s wife, he wasted his seed on the ground in order not to give offspring to his brother. 
GEN.38.10	But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the L
GEN.38.11	Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Remain a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up”; for he thought, “
GEN.38.12	Now after a considerable time Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and when the time of mourning was ended, Judah went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 
GEN.38.13	It was told to Tamar, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.” 
GEN.38.14	So she removed her widow’s garments and covered 
GEN.38.15	When Judah saw her, he thought she 
GEN.38.16	So he turned aside to her by the road, and said, “Here now, let me come in to you”; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?” 
GEN.38.17	He said, therefore, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.” She said, moreover, “Will you give a pledge until you send 
GEN.38.18	He said, “What pledge shall I give you?” And she said, “Your seal and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.” So he gave 
GEN.38.19	Then she arose and departed, and removed her veil and put on her widow’s garments.
GEN.38.20	When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, he did not find her. 
GEN.38.21	He asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the temple prostitute who was by the road at Enaim?” But they said, “There has been no temple prostitute here.” 
GEN.38.22	So he returned to Judah, and said, “I did not find her; and furthermore, the men of the place said, ‘There has been no temple prostitute here.’ ” 
GEN.38.23	Then Judah said, “Let her keep them, otherwise we will become a laughingstock. After all, I sent this young goat, but you did not find her.”
GEN.38.24	Now it was about three months later that Judah was informed, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has played the harlot, and behold, she is also with child by harlotry.” Then Judah said, “Bring her out and let her be burned!” 
GEN.38.25	It was while she was being brought out that she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “I am with child by the man to whom these things belong.” And she said, “Please examine and see, whose signet ring and cords and staff are these?” 
GEN.38.26	Judah recognized 
GEN.38.27	It came about at the time she was giving birth, that behold, there were twins in her womb. 
GEN.38.28	Moreover, it took place while she was giving birth, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet 
GEN.38.29	But it came about as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out. Then she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” So he was named 
GEN.38.30	Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet 
GEN.39.1	Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard, bought him from the Ishmaelites, who had taken him down there. 
GEN.39.2	The L
GEN.39.3	Now his master saw that the L
GEN.39.4	So Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal servant; and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he owned he put in his charge. 
GEN.39.5	It came about that from the time he made him overseer in his house and over all that he owned, the L
GEN.39.6	So he left everything he owned in Joseph’s charge; and with him 
GEN.39.7	It came about after these events that his master’s wife looked with desire at Joseph, and she said, “Lie with me.” 
GEN.39.8	But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, with me 
GEN.39.9	There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great evil and sin against God?” 
GEN.39.10	As she spoke to Joseph day after day, he did not listen to her to lie beside her 
GEN.39.11	Now it happened one day that he went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the household was there inside. 
GEN.39.12	She caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!” And he left his garment in her hand and fled, and went outside. 
GEN.39.13	When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside, 
GEN.39.14	she called to the men of her household and said to them, “See, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to make sport of us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I screamed. 
GEN.39.15	When he heard that I raised my voice and 
GEN.39.16	So she left his garment beside her until his master came home. 
GEN.39.17	Then she spoke to him with these words, “The Hebrew slave, whom you brought to us, came in to me to make sport of me; 
GEN.39.18	and as I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.”
GEN.39.19	Now when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, “This is what your slave did to me,” his anger burned. 
GEN.39.20	So Joseph’s master took him and put him into the jail, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined; and he was there in the jail. 
GEN.39.21	But the L
GEN.39.22	The chief jailer committed to Joseph’s charge all the prisoners who were in the jail; so that whatever was done there, he was responsible 
GEN.39.23	The chief jailer did not supervise anything under Joseph’s charge because the L
GEN.40.1	Then it came about after these things, the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt offended their lord, the king of Egypt. 
GEN.40.2	Pharaoh was furious with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. 
GEN.40.3	So he put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, in the jail, the 
GEN.40.4	The captain of the bodyguard put Joseph in charge of them, and he took care of them; and they were in confinement for some time. 
GEN.40.5	Then the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt, who were confined in jail, both had a dream the same night, each man with his 
GEN.40.6	When Joseph came to them in the morning and observed them, behold, they were dejected. 
GEN.40.7	He asked Pharaoh’s officials who were with him in confinement in his master’s house, “Why are your faces so sad today?” 
GEN.40.8	Then they said to him, “We have had a dream and there is no one to interpret it.” Then Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell 
GEN.40.9	So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream, behold, 
GEN.40.10	and on the vine 
GEN.40.11	Now Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; so I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.” 
GEN.40.12	Then Joseph said to him, “This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days; 
GEN.40.13	within three more days Pharaoh will 
GEN.40.14	Only keep me in mind when it goes well with you, and please do me a kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh and get me out of this house. 
GEN.40.15	For I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon.”
GEN.40.16	When the chief baker saw that he had interpreted favorably, he said to Joseph, “I also 
GEN.40.17	and in the top basket 
GEN.40.18	Then Joseph answered and said, “This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days; 
GEN.40.19	within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and will hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh off you.”
GEN.40.20	Thus it came about on the third day, 
GEN.40.21	He restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand; 
GEN.40.22	but he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them. 
GEN.40.23	Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
GEN.41.1	Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh had a dream, and behold, he was standing by the Nile. 
GEN.41.2	And lo, from the Nile there came up seven cows, sleek and fat; and they grazed in the marsh grass. 
GEN.41.3	Then behold, seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, ugly and gaunt, and they stood by the 
GEN.41.4	The ugly and gaunt cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke. 
GEN.41.5	He fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain came up on a single stalk, plump and good. 
GEN.41.6	Then behold, seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them. 
GEN.41.7	The thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and behold, 
GEN.41.8	Now in the morning his spirit was troubled, so he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
GEN.41.9	Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I would make mention today of my 
GEN.41.10	Pharaoh was furious with his servants, and he put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, 
GEN.41.11	We had a dream on the same night, he and I; each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his 
GEN.41.12	Now a Hebrew youth 
GEN.41.13	And just as he interpreted for us, so it happened; he restored me in my office, but he hanged him.”
GEN.41.14	Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph, and they hurriedly brought him out of the dungeon; and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came to Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.15	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, but no one can interpret it; and I have heard it said about you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” 
GEN.41.16	Joseph then answered Pharaoh, saying, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.” 
GEN.41.17	So Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the Nile; 
GEN.41.18	and behold, seven cows, fat and sleek came up out of the Nile, and they grazed in the marsh grass. 
GEN.41.19	Lo, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and gaunt, such as I had never seen for ugliness in all the land of Egypt; 
GEN.41.20	and the lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows. 
GEN.41.21	Yet when they had devoured them, it could not be detected that they had devoured them, for they were just as ugly as before. Then I awoke. 
GEN.41.22	I saw also in my dream, and behold, seven ears, full and good, came up on a single stalk; 
GEN.41.23	and lo, seven ears, withered, thin, 
GEN.41.24	and the thin ears swallowed the seven good ears. Then I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”
GEN.41.25	Now Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s dreams are one 
GEN.41.26	The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one 
GEN.41.27	The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven thin ears scorched by the east wind will be seven years of famine. 
GEN.41.28	It is as I have spoken to Pharaoh: God has shown to Pharaoh what He is about to do. 
GEN.41.29	Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming in all the land of Egypt; 
GEN.41.30	and after them seven years of famine will come, and all the abundance will be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine will ravage the land. 
GEN.41.31	So the abundance will be unknown in the land because of that subsequent famine; for it 
GEN.41.32	Now as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, 
GEN.41.33	Now let Pharaoh look for a man discerning and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers in charge of the land, and let him exact a fifth 
GEN.41.35	Then let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and store up the grain for food in the cities under Pharaoh’s authority, and let them guard 
GEN.41.36	Let the food become as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which will occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land will not perish during the famine.”
GEN.41.37	Now the proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.
GEN.41.38	Then Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find a man like this, in whom is a divine spirit?” 
GEN.41.39	So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has informed you of all this, there is no one so discerning and wise as you are. 
GEN.41.40	You shall be over my house, and according to your command all my people shall do homage; only in the throne I will be greater than you.” 
GEN.41.41	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.42	Then Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put the gold necklace around his neck. 
GEN.41.43	He had him ride in his second chariot; and they proclaimed before him, “Bow the knee!” And he set him over all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.44	Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, “
GEN.41.45	Then Pharaoh named Joseph 
GEN.41.46	Now Joseph was thirty years old when he 
GEN.41.47	During the seven years of plenty the land brought forth abundantly. 
GEN.41.48	So he gathered all the food of 
GEN.41.49	Thus Joseph stored up grain in great abundance like the sand of the sea, until he stopped measuring 
GEN.41.50	Now before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of 
GEN.41.51	Joseph named the firstborn 
GEN.41.52	He named the second 
GEN.41.53	When the seven years of plenty which had been in the land of Egypt came to an end, 
GEN.41.54	and the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said, then there was famine in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 
GEN.41.55	So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, you shall do.” 
GEN.41.56	When the famine was 
GEN.41.57	 all the earth came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the earth.
GEN.42.1	Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, “Why are you staring at one another?” 
GEN.42.2	He said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there and buy 
GEN.42.3	Then ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
GEN.42.4	But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, “I am afraid that harm may befall him.” 
GEN.42.5	So the sons of Israel came to buy grain among those who were coming, for the famine was in the land of Canaan 
GEN.42.6	Now Joseph was the ruler over the land; he was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down to him with 
GEN.42.7	When Joseph saw his brothers he recognized them, but he disguised himself to them and spoke to them harshly. And he said to them, “Where have you come from?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.”
GEN.42.8	But Joseph had recognized his brothers, although they did not recognize him. 
GEN.42.9	Joseph remembered the dreams which he had about them, and said to them, “You are spies; you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land.” 
GEN.42.10	Then they said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. 
GEN.42.11	We are all sons of one man; we are honest men, your servants are not spies.” 
GEN.42.12	Yet he said to them, “No, but you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land!” 
GEN.42.13	But they said, “Your servants are twelve brothers 
GEN.42.14	Joseph said to them, “It is as I said to you, you are spies; 
GEN.42.15	by this you will be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here! 
GEN.42.16	Send one of you that he may get your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. But if not, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies.” 
GEN.42.17	So he put them all together in prison for three days.
GEN.42.18	Now Joseph said to them on the third day, “Do this and live, for I fear God: 
GEN.42.19	if you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined in your prison; but as for 
GEN.42.20	and bring your youngest brother to me, so your words may be verified, and you will not die.” And they did so. 
GEN.42.21	Then they said to one another, “Truly we are guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, yet we would not listen; therefore this distress has come upon us.” 
GEN.42.22	Reuben answered them, saying, “Did I not tell you, ‘Do not sin against the boy’; and you would not listen? Now comes the reckoning for his blood.” 
GEN.42.23	They did not know, however, that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them. 
GEN.42.24	He turned away from them and wept. But when he returned to them and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes. 
GEN.42.25	Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to restore every man’s money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. And thus it was done for them.
GEN.42.26	So they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed from there. 
GEN.42.27	As one 
GEN.42.28	Then he said to his brothers, “My money has been returned, and behold, it is even in my sack.” And their hearts sank, and they 
GEN.42.29	When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying, 
GEN.42.30	“The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly with us, and took us for spies of the country. 
GEN.42.31	But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies. 
GEN.42.32	We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no longer alive, and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.’ 
GEN.42.33	The man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me and take 
GEN.42.34	But bring your youngest brother to me that I may know that you are not spies, but honest men. I will give your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.’ ”
GEN.42.35	Now it came about as they were emptying their sacks, that behold, every man’s bundle of money 
GEN.42.36	Their father Jacob said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and you would take Benjamin; all these things are against me.” 
GEN.42.37	Then Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him 
GEN.42.38	But Jacob said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If harm should befall him on the journey you are taking, then you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.”
GEN.43.1	Now the famine was severe in the land. 
GEN.43.2	So it came about when they had finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, “Go back, buy us a little food.” 
GEN.43.3	Judah spoke to him, however, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’ 
GEN.43.4	If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food. 
GEN.43.5	But if you do not send 
GEN.43.6	Then Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man whether you still had 
GEN.43.7	But they said, “The man questioned particularly about us and our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you 
GEN.43.8	Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the lad with me and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, we as well as you and our little ones. 
GEN.43.9	I myself will be surety for him; you may hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him 
GEN.43.10	For if we had not delayed, surely by now we could have returned twice.”
GEN.43.11	Then their father Israel said to them, “If 
GEN.43.12	Take double 
GEN.43.13	Take your brother also, and arise, return to the man; 
GEN.43.14	and may God Almighty grant you compassion in the sight of the man, so that he will release to you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.” 
GEN.43.15	So the men took this present, and they took double 
GEN.43.16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his house steward, “Bring the men into the house, and slay an animal and make ready; for the men are to dine with me at noon.” 
GEN.43.17	So the man did as Joseph said, and brought the men to Joseph’s house. 
GEN.43.18	Now the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, “
GEN.43.19	So they came near to Joseph’s house steward, and spoke to him at the entrance of the house, 
GEN.43.20	and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food, 
GEN.43.21	and it came about when we came to the lodging place, that we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full. So we have brought it back in our hand. 
GEN.43.22	We have also brought down other money in our hand to buy food; we do not know who put our money in our sacks.” 
GEN.43.23	He said, “
GEN.43.24	Then the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys fodder. 
GEN.43.25	So they prepared the present for Joseph’s coming at noon; for they had heard that they were to eat a meal there.
GEN.43.26	When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present which was in their hand and bowed to the ground before him. 
GEN.43.27	Then he asked them about their welfare, and said, “Is your old father well, of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?” 
GEN.43.28	They said, “Your servant our father is well; he is still alive.” They bowed down in homage. 
GEN.43.29	As he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, he said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” And he said, “May God be gracious to you, my son.” 
GEN.43.30	Joseph hurried 
GEN.43.31	Then he washed his face and came out; and he controlled himself and said, “Serve the meal.” 
GEN.43.32	So they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is loathsome to the Egyptians. 
GEN.43.33	Now they were seated before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, and the men looked at one another in astonishment. 
GEN.43.34	He took portions to them from his own table, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. So they feasted and drank freely with him.
GEN.44.1	Then he commanded his house steward, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in the mouth of his sack. 
GEN.44.2	Put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his money for the grain.” And he did as Joseph had told 
GEN.44.3	As soon as it was light, the men were sent away, they with their donkeys. 
GEN.44.4	They had 
GEN.44.5	Is not this the one from which my lord drinks and which he indeed uses for divination? You have done wrong in doing this.’ ”
GEN.44.6	So he overtook them and spoke these words to them. 
GEN.44.7	They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing. 
GEN.44.8	Behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks we have brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house? 
GEN.44.9	With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.” 
GEN.44.10	So he said, “Now let it also be according to your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and 
GEN.44.11	Then they hurried, each man lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack. 
GEN.44.12	He searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 
GEN.44.13	Then they tore their clothes, and when each man loaded his donkey, they returned to the city.
GEN.44.14	When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, he was still there, and they fell to the ground before him. 
GEN.44.15	Joseph said to them, “What is this deed that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can indeed practice divination?” 
GEN.44.16	So Judah said, “What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants; behold, we are my lord’s slaves, both we and the one in whose possession the cup has been found.” 
GEN.44.17	But he said, “Far be it from me to do this. The man in whose possession the cup has been found, he shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.”
GEN.44.18	Then Judah approached him, and said, “Oh my lord, may your servant please speak a word in my lord’s ears, and do not be angry with your servant; for you are equal to Pharaoh. 
GEN.44.19	My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father or a brother?’ 
GEN.44.20	We said to my lord, ‘We have an old father and a little child of 
GEN.44.21	Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me that I may set my eyes on him.’ 
GEN.44.22	But we said to my lord, ‘The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’ 
GEN.44.23	You said to your servants, however, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.’ 
GEN.44.24	Thus it came about when we went up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 
GEN.44.25	Our father said, ‘Go back, buy us a little food.’ 
GEN.44.26	But we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’ 
GEN.44.27	Your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons; 
GEN.44.28	and the one went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn in pieces,” and I have not seen him since. 
GEN.44.29	If you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.’ 
GEN.44.30	Now, therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his life is bound up in the lad’s life, 
GEN.44.31	when he sees that the lad is not 
GEN.44.32	For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him 
GEN.44.33	Now, therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the lad a slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	For how shall I go up to my father if the lad is not with me—for fear that I see the evil that would overtake my father?”
GEN.45.1	Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried, “Have everyone go out from me.” So there was no man with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers. 
GEN.45.2	He wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard 
GEN.45.3	Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.
GEN.45.4	Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come closer to me.” And they came closer. And he said, “I am your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. 
GEN.45.5	Now do not be grieved or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life. 
GEN.45.6	For the famine 
GEN.45.7	God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance. 
GEN.45.8	Now, therefore, it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.45.9	Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph, “God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay. 
GEN.45.10	You shall live in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children’s children and your flocks and your herds and all that you have. 
GEN.45.11	There I will also provide for you, for there are still five years of famine 
GEN.45.12	Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin 
GEN.45.13	Now you must tell my father of all my splendor in Egypt, and all that you have seen; and you must hurry and bring my father down here.” 
GEN.45.14	Then he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck. 
GEN.45.15	He kissed all his brothers and wept on them, and afterward his brothers talked with him.
GEN.45.16	Now when the news was heard in Pharaoh’s house that Joseph’s brothers had come, it pleased Pharaoh and his servants. 
GEN.45.17	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: load your beasts and go to the land of Canaan, 
GEN.45.18	and take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you will eat the fat of the land.’ 
GEN.45.19	Now you are ordered, ‘Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father and come. 
GEN.45.20	Do not concern yourselves with your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’ ”
GEN.45.21	Then the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey. 
GEN.45.22	To each of them he gave changes of garments, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred 
GEN.45.23	To his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and sustenance for his father on the journey.
GEN.45.24	So he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, “Do not quarrel on the journey.” 
GEN.45.25	Then they went up from Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob. 
GEN.45.26	They told him, saying, “Joseph is still alive, and indeed he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” But he was stunned, for he did not believe them. 
GEN.45.27	When they told him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived. 
GEN.45.28	Then Israel said, “It is enough; my son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”
GEN.46.1	So Israel set out with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 
GEN.46.2	God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, “Jacob, Jacob.” And he said, “Here I am.” 
GEN.46.3	He said, “I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you a great nation there. 
GEN.46.4	I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you up again; and Joseph will close your eyes.”
GEN.46.5	Then Jacob arose from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
GEN.46.6	They took their livestock and their property, which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, Jacob and all his descendants with him: 
GEN.46.7	his sons and his grandsons with him, his daughters and his granddaughters, and all his descendants he brought with him to Egypt.
GEN.46.8	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, Jacob and his sons, who went to Egypt: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn. 
GEN.46.9	The sons of Reuben: Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi. 
GEN.46.10	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. 
GEN.46.11	The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
GEN.46.12	The sons of Judah: Er and Onan and Shelah and Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. 
GEN.46.13	The sons of Issachar: Tola and Puvvah and Iob and Shimron. 
GEN.46.14	The sons of Zebulun: Sered and Elon and Jahleel. 
GEN.46.15	These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all his sons and his daughters 
GEN.46.16	The sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli. 
GEN.46.17	The sons of Asher: Imnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah and their sister Serah. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. 
GEN.46.18	These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah; and she bore to Jacob these sixteen persons. 
GEN.46.19	The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.46.20	Now to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him. 
GEN.46.21	The sons of Benjamin: Bela and Becher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard. 
GEN.46.22	These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; 
GEN.46.23	The sons of Dan: Hushim. 
GEN.46.24	The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and Shillem. 
GEN.46.25	These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, and she bore these to Jacob; 
GEN.46.26	All the persons belonging to Jacob, who came to Egypt, his direct descendants, not including the wives of Jacob’s sons, 
GEN.46.27	and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt were two; all the persons of the house of Jacob, who came to Egypt, 
GEN.46.28	Now he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to point out 
GEN.46.29	Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel; as soon as he appeared before him, he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a long time. 
GEN.46.30	Then Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.” 
GEN.46.31	Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household, who 
GEN.46.32	and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.’ 
GEN.46.33	When Pharaoh calls you and says, ‘What is your occupation?’ 
GEN.46.34	you shall say, ‘Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,’ that you may live in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is loathsome to the Egyptians.”
GEN.47.1	Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, “My father and my brothers and their flocks and their herds and all that they have, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.” 
GEN.47.2	He took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.3	Then Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” So they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers.” 
GEN.47.4	They said to Pharaoh, “We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now, therefore, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen.” 
GEN.47.5	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. 
GEN.47.6	The land of Egypt is 
GEN.47.7	Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him to Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.8	Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many years have you lived?” 
GEN.47.9	So Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The years of my sojourning are one hundred and thirty; few and unpleasant have been the years of my life, nor have they attained the years that my fathers lived during the days of their sojourning.” 
GEN.47.10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from his presence. 
GEN.47.11	So Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had ordered. 
GEN.47.12	Joseph provided his father and his brothers and all his father’s household with food, according to their little ones.
GEN.47.13	Now there was no food in all the land, because the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine. 
GEN.47.14	Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house. 
GEN.47.15	When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food, for why should we die in your presence? For 
GEN.47.16	Then Joseph said, “Give up your livestock, and I will give you 
GEN.47.17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses and the flocks and the herds and the donkeys; and he fed them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year. 
GEN.47.18	When that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent, and the cattle are my lord’s. There is nothing left for my lord except our bodies and our lands. 
GEN.47.19	Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh. So give us seed, that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.”
GEN.47.20	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. Thus the land became Pharaoh’s. 
GEN.47.21	As for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of Egypt’s border to the other. 
GEN.47.22	Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they lived off the allotment which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore, they did not sell their land. 
GEN.47.23	Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have today bought you and your land for Pharaoh; now, 
GEN.47.24	At the harvest you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for those of your households and as food for your little ones.” 
GEN.47.25	So they said, “You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s slaves.” 
GEN.47.26	Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt 
GEN.47.27	Now Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in Goshen, and they acquired property in it and were fruitful and became very numerous. 
GEN.47.28	Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the length of Jacob’s life was one hundred and forty-seven years.
GEN.47.29	When the time for Israel to die drew near, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “Please, if I have found favor in your sight, place now your hand under my thigh and deal with me in kindness and 
GEN.47.30	but when I lie down with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place.” And he said, “I will do as you have said.” 
GEN.47.31	He said, “Swear to me.” So he swore to him. Then Israel bowed 
GEN.48.1	Now it came about after these things that Joseph was told, “Behold, your father is sick.” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him. 
GEN.48.2	When it was told to Jacob, “Behold, your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel collected his strength and sat up in the bed. 
GEN.48.3	Then Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, 
GEN.48.4	and He said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and numerous, and I will make you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession.’ 
GEN.48.5	Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are. 
GEN.48.6	But your offspring that have been born after them shall be yours; they shall be called by the names of their brothers in their inheritance. 
GEN.48.7	Now as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died, to my sorrow, in the land of Canaan on the journey, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”
GEN.48.8	When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he said, “Who are these?” 
GEN.48.9	Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” So he said, “Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them.” 
GEN.48.10	Now the eyes of Israel were 
GEN.48.11	Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face, and behold, God has let me see your children as well.” 
GEN.48.12	Then Joseph took them from his knees, and bowed with his face to the ground. 
GEN.48.13	Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel’s left, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel’s right, and brought them close to him. 
GEN.48.14	But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, crossing his hands, although Manasseh was the firstborn. 
GEN.48.15	He blessed Joseph, and said,
GEN.48.15	“The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,
GEN.48.15	The God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,
GEN.48.16	The angel who has redeemed me from all evil,
GEN.48.16	Bless the lads;
GEN.48.16	And may my name live on in them,
GEN.48.16	And the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;
GEN.48.16	And may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.”
GEN.48.17	When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on Ephraim’s head, it displeased him; and he grasped his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. 
GEN.48.18	Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this one is the firstborn. Place your right hand on his head.” 
GEN.48.19	But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know; he also will become a people and he also will be great. However, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations.” 
GEN.48.20	He blessed them that day, saying,
GEN.48.20	“By you Israel will pronounce blessing, saying,
GEN.48.20	‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh!’ ”
GEN.48.20	Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh. 
GEN.48.21	Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you, and bring you back to the land of your fathers. 
GEN.48.22	I give you one portion more than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow.”
GEN.49.1	Then Jacob summoned his sons and said, “Assemble yourselves that I may tell you what will befall you in the days to come.
GEN.49.2	Gather together and hear, O sons of Jacob;
GEN.49.2	And listen to Israel your father.
GEN.49.3	“Reuben, you are my firstborn;
GEN.49.3	My might and the beginning of my strength,
GEN.49.3	Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.
GEN.49.4	Uncontrolled as water, you shall not have preeminence,
GEN.49.4	Because you went up to your father’s bed;
GEN.49.4	Then you defiled 
GEN.49.5	“Simeon and Levi are brothers;
GEN.49.5	Their swords are implements of violence.
GEN.49.6	Let my soul not enter into their council;
GEN.49.6	Let not my glory be united with their assembly;
GEN.49.6	Because in their anger they slew men,
GEN.49.6	And in their self-will they lamed oxen.
GEN.49.7	Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce;
GEN.49.7	And their wrath, for it is cruel.
GEN.49.7	I will disperse them in Jacob,
GEN.49.7	And scatter them in Israel.
GEN.49.8	“Judah, your brothers shall praise you;
GEN.49.8	Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies;
GEN.49.8	Your father’s sons shall bow down to you.
GEN.49.9	Judah is a lion’s whelp;
GEN.49.9	From the prey, my son, you have gone up.
GEN.49.9	He couches, he lies down as a lion,
GEN.49.9	And as a lion, who dares rouse him up?
GEN.49.10	The scepter shall not depart from Judah,
GEN.49.10	Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet,
GEN.49.10	And to him 
GEN.49.11	He ties 
GEN.49.11	And his donkey’s colt to the choice vine;
GEN.49.11	He washes his garments in wine,
GEN.49.11	And his robes in the blood of grapes.
GEN.49.12	His eyes are 
GEN.49.12	And his teeth 
GEN.49.13	“Zebulun will dwell at the seashore;
GEN.49.13	And he 
GEN.49.13	And his flank 
GEN.49.14	“Issachar is a strong donkey,

GEN.49.15	When he saw that a resting place was good
GEN.49.15	And that the land was pleasant,
GEN.49.15	He bowed his shoulder to bear 
GEN.49.15	And became a slave at forced labor.
GEN.49.16	“Dan shall judge his people,
GEN.49.16	As one of the tribes of Israel.
GEN.49.17	Dan shall be a serpent in the way,
GEN.49.17	A horned snake in the path,
GEN.49.17	That bites the horse’s heels,
GEN.49.17	So that his rider falls backward.

GEN.49.19	But he will raid 
GEN.49.20	“As for Asher, his food shall be rich,
GEN.49.20	And he will yield royal dainties.
GEN.49.21	“Naphtali is a doe let loose,
GEN.49.21	He gives beautiful words.
GEN.49.22	“Joseph is a fruitful 
GEN.49.22	A fruitful bough by a spring;
GEN.49.23	The archers bitterly attacked him,
GEN.49.23	And shot 
GEN.49.24	But his bow remained firm,
GEN.49.24	And his arms were agile,
GEN.49.24	From the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob
GEN.49.24	(From there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel),
GEN.49.25	From the God of your father who helps you,
GEN.49.25	And by the Almighty who blesses you
GEN.49.25	Blessings of the deep that lies beneath,
GEN.49.25	Blessings of the breasts and of the womb.
GEN.49.26	The blessings of your father
GEN.49.26	Have surpassed the blessings of my ancestors
GEN.49.26	Up to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills;
GEN.49.26	May they be on the head of Joseph,
GEN.49.26	And on the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers.
GEN.49.27	“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf;
GEN.49.27	In the morning he devours the prey,
GEN.49.27	And in the evening he divides the spoil.”
GEN.49.28	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them. He blessed them, every one with the blessing appropriate to him. 
GEN.49.29	Then he charged them and said to them, “I am about to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
GEN.49.30	in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a burial site. 
GEN.49.31	There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah, there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah, and there I buried Leah— 
GEN.49.32	the field and the cave that is in it, purchased from the sons of Heth.” 
GEN.49.33	When Jacob finished charging his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.
GEN.50.1	Then Joseph fell on his father’s face, and wept over him and kissed him. 
GEN.50.2	Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel. 
GEN.50.3	Now forty days were required for it, for such is the period required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.
GEN.50.4	When the days of mourning for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your sight, please speak to Pharaoh, saying, 
GEN.50.5	‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am about to die; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me.” Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.’ ” 
GEN.50.6	Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.”
GEN.50.7	So Joseph went up to bury his father, and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 
GEN.50.8	and all the household of Joseph and his brothers and his father’s household; they left only their little ones and their flocks and their herds in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	There also went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and it was a very great company. 
GEN.50.10	When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful lamentation; and he observed seven days mourning for his father. 
GEN.50.11	Now when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning for the Egyptians.” Therefore it was named Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
GEN.50.12	Thus his sons did for him as he had charged them; 
GEN.50.13	for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field for a burial site from Ephron the Hittite. 
GEN.50.14	After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers, and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.
GEN.50.15	When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph bears a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the wrong which we did to him!” 
GEN.50.16	So they sent 
GEN.50.17	‘Thus you shall say to Joseph, “Please forgive, I beg you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did you wrong.” ’ And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” And Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 
GEN.50.18	Then his brothers also came and fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.” 
GEN.50.19	But Joseph said to them, “Do not be afraid, for am I in God’s place? 
GEN.50.20	As for you, you meant evil against me, 
GEN.50.21	So therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones.” So he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.
GEN.50.22	Now Joseph stayed in Egypt, he and his father’s household, and Joseph lived one hundred and ten years. 
GEN.50.23	Joseph saw the third generation of Ephraim’s sons; also the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph’s knees. 
GEN.50.24	Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will surely take care of you and bring you up from this land to the land which He promised on oath to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob.” 
GEN.50.25	Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, “God will surely take care of you, and you shall carry my bones up from here.” 
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years; and he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.
EXO.1.1	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; they came each one with his household: 
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah; 
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin; 
EXO.1.4	Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 
EXO.1.5	All the persons who came from the loins of Jacob were seventy in number, but Joseph was 
EXO.1.6	Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation. 
EXO.1.7	But the sons of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly, and multiplied, and became exceedingly mighty, so that the land was filled with them.
EXO.1.8	Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. 
EXO.1.9	He said to his people, “Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we. 
EXO.1.10	Come, let us deal wisely with them, or else they will multiply and in the event of war, they will also join themselves to those who hate us, and fight against us and depart from the land.” 
EXO.1.11	So they appointed taskmasters over them to afflict them with hard labor. And they built for Pharaoh storage cities, Pithom and Raamses. 
EXO.1.12	But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out, so that they were in dread of the sons of Israel. 
EXO.1.13	The Egyptians compelled the sons of Israel to labor rigorously; 
EXO.1.14	and they made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and bricks and at all 
EXO.1.15	Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other was named Puah; 
EXO.1.16	and he said, “When you are helping the Hebrew women to give birth and see 
EXO.1.17	But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded them, but let the boys live. 
EXO.1.18	So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this thing, and let the boys live?” 
EXO.1.19	The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife can get to them.” 
EXO.1.20	So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied, and became very mighty. 
EXO.1.21	Because the midwives feared God, He established households for them. 
EXO.1.22	Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “Every son who is born 
EXO.2.1	Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi. 
EXO.2.2	The woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months. 
EXO.2.3	But when she could hide him no longer, she got him a 
EXO.2.4	His sister stood at a distance to find out what would happen to him.
EXO.2.5	The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the Nile, with her maidens walking alongside the Nile; and she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid, and she brought it 
EXO.2.6	When she opened 
EXO.2.7	Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women that she may nurse the child for you?” 
EXO.2.8	Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go 
EXO.2.9	Then Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away and nurse him for me and I will give 
EXO.2.10	The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. And she named him Moses, and said, “Because I drew him out of the water.”
EXO.2.11	Now it came about in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brethren and looked on their hard labors; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren. 
EXO.2.12	So he looked this way and that, and when he saw there was no one 
EXO.2.13	He went out the next day, and behold, two Hebrews were fighting with each other; and he said to the offender, “Why are you striking your companion?” 
EXO.2.14	But he said, “Who made you a prince or a judge over us? Are you intending to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and said, “Surely the matter has become known.”
EXO.2.15	When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the presence of Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.
EXO.2.16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came to draw water and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. 
EXO.2.17	Then the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock. 
EXO.2.18	When they came to Reuel their father, he said, “Why have you come 
EXO.2.19	So they said, “An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and what is more, he even drew the water for us and watered the flock.” 
EXO.2.20	He said to his daughters, “Where is he then? Why is it that you have left the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat.” 
EXO.2.21	Moses was willing to dwell with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses. 
EXO.2.22	Then she gave birth to a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, “I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.”
EXO.2.23	Now it came about in 
EXO.2.24	So God heard their groaning; and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
EXO.2.25	God saw the sons of Israel, and God took notice 
EXO.3.1	Now Moses was pasturing the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. 
EXO.3.2	The angel of the L
EXO.3.3	So Moses said, “I must turn aside now and see this marvelous sight, why the bush is not burned up.” 
EXO.3.4	When the L
EXO.3.5	Then He said, “Do not come near here; remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” 
EXO.3.6	He said also, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Then Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.
EXO.3.7	The L
EXO.3.8	So I have come down to deliver them from the power of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite. 
EXO.3.9	Now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me; furthermore, I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them.
EXO.3.10	Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may bring My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.” 
EXO.3.11	But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?” 
EXO.3.12	And He said, “Certainly I will be with you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God at this mountain.”
EXO.3.13	Then Moses said to God, “Behold, I am going to the sons of Israel, and I will say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you.’ Now they may say to me, ‘What is His name?’ What shall I say to them?” 
EXO.3.14	God said to Moses, “
EXO.3.15	God, furthermore, said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, ‘The L
EXO.3.16	Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, ‘The L
EXO.3.17	So I said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.” ’ 
EXO.3.18	They will pay heed to what you say; and you with the elders of Israel will come to the king of Egypt and you will say to him, ‘The L
EXO.3.19	But I know that the king of Egypt will not permit you to go, except under compulsion. 
EXO.3.20	So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My miracles which I shall do in the midst of it; and after that he will let you go. 
EXO.3.21	I will grant this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and it shall be that when you go, you will not go empty-handed. 
EXO.3.22	But every woman shall ask of her neighbor and the woman who lives in her house, articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing; and you will put them on your sons and daughters. Thus you will plunder the Egyptians.”
EXO.4.1	Then Moses said, “What if they will not believe me or listen to what I say? For they may say, ‘The L
EXO.4.2	The L
EXO.4.3	Then He said, “Throw it on the ground.” So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it. 
EXO.4.4	But the L
EXO.4.5	“that they may believe that the L
EXO.4.6	The L
EXO.4.7	Then He said, “Put your hand into your bosom again.” So he put his hand into his bosom again, and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was restored like 
EXO.4.8	“If they will not believe you or heed the witness of the first sign, they may believe the witness of the last sign. 
EXO.4.9	But if they will not believe even these two signs or heed what you say, then you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water which you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.”
EXO.4.10	Then Moses said to the L
EXO.4.11	The L
EXO.4.12	Now then go, and I, even I, will be with your mouth, and teach you what you are to say.” 
EXO.4.13	But he said, “Please, Lord, now send 
EXO.4.14	Then the anger of the L
EXO.4.15	You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I, even I, will be with your mouth and his mouth, and I will teach you what you are to do. 
EXO.4.16	Moreover, he shall speak for you to the people; and he will be as a mouth for you and you will be as God to him. 
EXO.4.17	You shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs.”
EXO.4.18	Then Moses departed and returned to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Please, let me go, that I may return to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see if they are still alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” 
EXO.4.19	Now the L
EXO.4.20	So Moses took his wife and his sons and mounted them on a donkey, and returned to the land of Egypt. Moses also took the staff of God in his hand.
EXO.4.21	The L
EXO.4.22	Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the L
EXO.4.23	So I said to you, ‘Let My son go that he may serve Me’; but you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.” ’ ”
EXO.4.24	Now it came about at the lodging place on the way that the L
EXO.4.25	Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin and threw it at Moses’ feet, and she said, “You are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me.” 
EXO.4.26	So He let him alone. At that time she said, “
EXO.4.27	Now the L
EXO.4.28	Moses told Aaron all the words of the L
EXO.4.29	Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the sons of Israel; 
EXO.4.30	and Aaron spoke all the words which the L
EXO.4.31	So the people believed; and when they heard that the L
EXO.5.1	And afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, “Thus says the L
EXO.5.2	But Pharaoh said, “Who is the L
EXO.5.3	Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the L
EXO.5.4	But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you draw the people away from their work? Get 
EXO.5.5	Again Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now many, and you would have them cease from their labors!” 
EXO.5.6	So the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters over the people and their foremen, saying, 
EXO.5.7	“You are no longer to give the people straw to make brick as previously; let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
EXO.5.8	But the quota of bricks which they were making previously, you shall impose on them; you are not to reduce any of it. Because they are lazy, therefore they cry out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ 
EXO.5.9	Let the labor be heavier on the men, and let them work at it so that they will pay no attention to false words.”
EXO.5.10	So the taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out and spoke to the people, saying, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I am not going to give you 
EXO.5.11	You go 
EXO.5.12	So the people scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 
EXO.5.13	The taskmasters pressed them, saying, “Complete your work quota, 
EXO.5.14	Moreover, the foremen of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, “Why have you not completed your required amount either yesterday or today in making brick as previously?”
EXO.5.15	Then the foremen of the sons of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you deal this way with your servants? 
EXO.5.16	There is no straw given to your servants, yet they keep saying to us, ‘Make bricks!’ And behold, your servants are being beaten; but it is the fault of your 
EXO.5.17	But he said, “You are lazy, 
EXO.5.18	So go now 
EXO.5.19	The foremen of the sons of Israel saw that they were in trouble because they were told, “You must not reduce

EXO.5.21	They said to them, “May the L
EXO.5.22	Then Moses returned to the L
EXO.5.23	Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done harm to this people, and You have not delivered Your people at all.”
EXO.6.1	Then the L
EXO.6.2	God spoke further to Moses and said to him, “I am the L
EXO.6.3	and I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God Almighty, but 
EXO.6.4	I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they sojourned. 
EXO.6.5	Furthermore I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, because the Egyptians are holding them in bondage, and I have remembered My covenant. 
EXO.6.6	Say, therefore, to the sons of Israel, ‘I am the L
EXO.6.7	Then I will take you for My people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the L
EXO.6.8	I will bring you to the land which I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I will give it to you 
EXO.6.9	So Moses spoke thus to the sons of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses on account of 
EXO.6.10	Now the L
EXO.6.11	“Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the sons of Israel go out of his land.” 
EXO.6.12	But Moses spoke before the L
EXO.6.13	Then the L
EXO.6.14	These are the heads of their fathers’ households. The sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben. 
EXO.6.15	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon. 
EXO.6.16	These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon and Kohath and Merari; and the length of Levi’s life was one hundred and thirty-seven years. 
EXO.6.17	The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families. 
EXO.6.18	The sons of Kohath: Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel; and the length of Kohath’s life was one hundred and thirty-three years. 
EXO.6.19	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. 
EXO.6.20	Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the length of Amram’s life was one hundred and thirty-seven years. 
EXO.6.21	The sons of Izhar: Korah and Nepheg and Zichri. 
EXO.6.22	The sons of Uzziel: Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri. 
EXO.6.23	Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
EXO.6.24	The sons of Korah: Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites. 
EXO.6.25	Aaron’s son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’ 
EXO.6.26	It was 
EXO.6.27	They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the sons of Israel from Egypt; it was 
EXO.6.28	Now it came about on the day when the L
EXO.6.29	that the L
EXO.6.30	But Moses said before the L
EXO.7.1	Then the L
EXO.7.2	You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall speak to Pharaoh that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land. 
EXO.7.3	But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart that I may multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt. 
EXO.7.4	When Pharaoh does not listen to you, then I will lay My hand on Egypt and bring out My hosts, My people the sons of Israel, from the land of Egypt by great judgments. 
EXO.7.5	The Egyptians shall know that I am the L
EXO.7.6	So Moses and Aaron did 
EXO.7.7	Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
EXO.7.8	Now the L
EXO.7.9	“When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, ‘Work a miracle,’ then you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw 
EXO.7.10	So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and thus they did just as the L
EXO.7.11	Then Pharaoh also called for 
EXO.7.12	For each one threw down his staff and they turned into serpents. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs. 
EXO.7.13	Yet Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the L
EXO.7.14	Then the L
EXO.7.15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water, and station yourself to meet him on the bank of the Nile; and you shall take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpent. 
EXO.7.16	You shall say to him, ‘The L
EXO.7.17	Thus says the L
EXO.7.18	The fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will become foul, and the Egyptians will find difficulty in drinking water from the Nile.” ’ ” 
EXO.7.19	Then the L
EXO.7.20	So Moses and Aaron did even as the L
EXO.7.21	The fish that 
EXO.7.22	But the magicians of Egypt did the same with their secret arts; and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the L
EXO.7.23	Then Pharaoh turned and went into his house with no concern even for this. 
EXO.7.24	So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the Nile. 
EXO.7.25	Seven days passed after the L
EXO.8.1	Then the L
EXO.8.2	But if you refuse to let 
EXO.8.3	The Nile will swarm with frogs, which will come up and go into your house and into your bedroom and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and on your people, and into your ovens and into your kneading bowls. 
EXO.8.4	So the frogs will come up on you and your people and all your servants.” ’ ” 
EXO.8.5	Then the L
EXO.8.6	So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.7	The magicians did the same with their secret arts, making frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.8	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Entreat the L
EXO.8.9	Moses said to Pharaoh, “The honor is yours to tell me: when shall I entreat for you and your servants and your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, 
EXO.8.10	Then he said, “Tomorrow.” So he said, “
EXO.8.11	The frogs will depart from you and your houses and your servants and your people; they will be left only in the Nile.” 
EXO.8.12	Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the L
EXO.8.13	The L
EXO.8.14	So they piled them in heaps, and the land became foul. 
EXO.8.15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, as the L
EXO.8.16	Then the L
EXO.8.17	They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats through all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.18	The magicians tried with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not; so there were gnats on man and beast. 
EXO.8.19	Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the L
EXO.8.20	Now the L
EXO.8.21	For if you do not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and on your servants and on your people and into your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians will be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they 
EXO.8.22	But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where My people are living, so that no swarms of flies will be there, in order that you may know that I, the L
EXO.8.23	I will 
EXO.8.24	Then the L
EXO.8.25	Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God within the land.” 
EXO.8.26	But Moses said, “It is not right to do so, for we will sacrifice to the L
EXO.8.27	We must go a three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the L
EXO.8.28	Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the L
EXO.8.29	Then Moses said, “Behold, I am going out from you, and I shall make supplication to the L
EXO.8.30	So Moses went out from Pharaoh and made supplication to the L
EXO.8.31	The L
EXO.8.32	But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.
EXO.9.1	Then the L
EXO.9.2	For if you refuse to let 
EXO.9.3	behold, the hand of the L
EXO.9.4	But the L
EXO.9.5	The L
EXO.9.6	So the L
EXO.9.7	Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not even one of the livestock of Israel dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
EXO.9.8	Then the L
EXO.9.9	It will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and will become boils breaking out with sores on man and beast through all the land of Egypt.” 
EXO.9.10	So they took soot from a kiln, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses threw it toward the sky, and it became boils breaking out with sores on man and beast. 
EXO.9.11	The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians. 
EXO.9.12	And the L
EXO.9.13	Then the L
EXO.9.14	For this time I will send all My plagues on you and your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is no one like Me in all the earth. 
EXO.9.15	For 
EXO.9.16	But, indeed, for this reason I have allowed you to remain, in order to show you My power and in order to proclaim My name through all the earth. 
EXO.9.17	Still you exalt yourself against My people by not letting them go.
EXO.9.18	Behold, about this time tomorrow, I will send a very heavy hail, such as has not been 
EXO.9.19	Now therefore send, bring your livestock and whatever you have in the field to safety. Every man and beast that is found in the field and is not brought home, when the hail comes down on them, will die.” ’ ” 
EXO.9.20	The one among the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of the L
EXO.9.21	but he who paid no regard to the word of the L
EXO.9.22	Now the L
EXO.9.23	Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, and the L
EXO.9.24	So there was hail, and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very severe, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
EXO.9.25	The hail struck all that was in the field through all the land of Egypt, both man and beast; the hail also struck every plant of the field and shattered every tree of the field. 
EXO.9.26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel 
EXO.9.27	Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “I have sinned this time; the L
EXO.9.28	Make supplication to the L
EXO.9.29	Moses said to him, “As soon as I go out of the city, I will spread out my hands to the L
EXO.9.30	But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the L
EXO.9.31	(Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud. 
EXO.9.32	But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they 
EXO.9.33	So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread out his hands to the L
EXO.9.34	But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 
EXO.9.35	Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not let the sons of Israel go, just as the L
EXO.10.1	Then the L
EXO.10.2	and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your grandson, how I made a mockery of the Egyptians and how I performed My signs among them, that you may know that I am the L
EXO.10.3	Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus says the L
EXO.10.4	For if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory. 
EXO.10.5	They shall cover the surface of the land, so that no one will be able to see the land. They will also eat the rest of what has escaped—what is left to you from the hail—and they will eat every tree which sprouts for you out of the field. 
EXO.10.6	Then your houses shall be filled and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians, 
EXO.10.7	Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the L
EXO.10.8	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, serve the L
EXO.10.9	Moses said, “We shall go with our young and our old; with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds we shall go, for we must hold a feast to the L
EXO.10.10	Then he said to them, “Thus may the L
EXO.10.11	Not so! Go now, the men 
EXO.10.12	Then the L
EXO.10.13	So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the L
EXO.10.14	The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled in all the territory of Egypt; 
EXO.10.15	For they covered the surface of the whole land, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every plant of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Thus nothing green was left on tree or plant of the field through all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.10.16	Then Pharaoh hurriedly called for Moses and Aaron, and he said, “I have sinned against the L
EXO.10.17	Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once, and make supplication to the L
EXO.10.18	He went out from Pharaoh and made supplication to the L
EXO.10.19	So the L
EXO.10.20	But the L
EXO.10.21	Then the L
EXO.10.22	So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days. 
EXO.10.23	They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days, but all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings. 
EXO.10.24	Then Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, “Go, serve the L
EXO.10.25	But Moses said, “You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice 
EXO.10.26	Therefore, our livestock too shall go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we shall take some of them to serve the L
EXO.10.27	But the L
EXO.10.28	Then Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Beware, do not see my face again, for in the day you see my face you shall die!” 
EXO.10.29	Moses said, “You are right; I shall never see your face again!”
EXO.11.1	Now the L
EXO.11.2	Speak now in the hearing of the people that each man ask from his neighbor and each woman from her neighbor for articles of silver and articles of gold.” 
EXO.11.3	The L
EXO.11.4	Moses said, “Thus says the L
EXO.11.5	and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of the Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the millstones; all the firstborn of the cattle as well. 
EXO.11.6	Moreover, there shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been 
EXO.11.7	But against any of the sons of Israel a dog will not 
EXO.11.8	All these your servants will come down to me and bow themselves before me, saying, ‘Go out, you and all the people who follow you,’ and after that I will go out.” And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
EXO.11.9	Then the L
EXO.11.10	Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh; yet the L
EXO.12.1	Now the L
EXO.12.2	“This month shall be the beginning of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year to you. 
EXO.12.3	Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth of this month they are each one to take a lamb for themselves, according to their fathers’ households, a lamb for each household. 
EXO.12.4	Now if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his neighbor nearest to his house are to take one according to the number of persons 
EXO.12.5	Your lamb shall be an unblemished male a year old; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. 
EXO.12.6	You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month, then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to kill it at twilight. 
EXO.12.7	Moreover, they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. 
EXO.12.8	They shall eat the flesh that 
EXO.12.9	Do not eat any of it raw or boiled at all with water, but rather roasted with fire, 
EXO.12.10	And you shall not leave any of it over until morning, but whatever is left of it until morning, you shall burn with fire. 
EXO.12.11	Now you shall eat it in this manner:

EXO.12.21	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go and take for yourselves lambs according to your families, and slay the Passover

EXO.12.29	Now it came about at midnight that the L
EXO.12.30	Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was no home where there was not someone dead. 
EXO.12.31	Then he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, “Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the sons of Israel; and go, worship the L
EXO.12.32	Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and go, and bless me also.”
EXO.12.33	The Egyptians urged the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, “We will all be dead.” 
EXO.12.34	So the people took their dough before it was leavened, 
EXO.12.35	Now the sons of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, for they had requested from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing; 
EXO.12.36	and the L
EXO.12.37	Now the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, aside from children. 
EXO.12.38	A mixed multitude also went up with them, along with flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock. 
EXO.12.39	They baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into cakes of unleavened bread. For it had not become leavened, since they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.
EXO.12.40	Now the time that the sons of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. 
EXO.12.41	And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, all the hosts of the L
EXO.12.42	It is a night to be observed for the L
EXO.12.43	The L
EXO.12.44	but every man’s slave purchased with money, after you have circumcised him, then he may eat of it. 
EXO.12.45	A sojourner or a hired servant shall not eat of it. 
EXO.12.46	It is to be eaten in a single house; you are not to bring forth any of the flesh outside of the house, nor are you to break any bone of it. 
EXO.12.47	All the congregation of Israel are to celebrate this. 
EXO.12.48	But if a stranger sojourns with you, and celebrates the Passover to the L
EXO.12.49	The same law shall apply to the native as to the stranger who sojourns among you.”
EXO.12.50	Then all the sons of Israel did 
EXO.12.51	And on that same day the L
EXO.13.1	Then the L
EXO.13.2	“Sanctify to Me every firstborn, the first offspring of every womb among the sons of Israel, both of man and beast; it belongs to Me.”
EXO.13.3	Moses said to the people, “Remember this day in which you went out from Egypt, from the house of slavery; for by a powerful hand the L
EXO.13.4	On this day in the month of Abib, you are about to go forth. 
EXO.13.5	It shall be when the L
EXO.13.6	For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the L
EXO.13.7	Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and nothing leavened shall be seen among you, nor shall any leaven be seen among you in all your borders. 
EXO.13.8	You shall tell your son on that day, saying, ‘It is because of what the L
EXO.13.9	And it shall serve as a sign to you on your hand, and as a reminder on your forehead, that the law of the L

EXO.13.11	“Now when the L
EXO.13.12	you shall devote to the L
EXO.13.13	But every first offspring of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, but if you do not redeem 
EXO.13.14	And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ then you shall say to him, ‘With a powerful hand the L
EXO.13.15	It came about, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that the L
EXO.13.16	So it shall serve as a sign on your hand and as phylacteries on your forehead, for with a powerful hand the L
EXO.13.17	Now when Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, even though it was near; for God said, “The people might change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt.” 
EXO.13.18	Hence God led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea; and the sons of Israel went up in martial array from the land of Egypt. 
EXO.13.19	Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, “God will surely take care of you, and you shall carry my bones from here with you.” 
EXO.13.20	Then they set out from Succoth and camped in Etham on the edge of the wilderness. 
EXO.13.21	The L
EXO.13.22	He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.
EXO.14.1	Now the L
EXO.14.2	“Tell the sons of Israel to turn back and camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you shall camp in front of Baal-zephon, opposite it, by the sea. 
EXO.14.3	For Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, ‘They are wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.’ 
EXO.14.4	Thus I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will chase after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the L
EXO.14.5	When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?” 
EXO.14.6	So he made his chariot ready and took his people with him; 
EXO.14.7	and he took six hundred select chariots, and all the 
EXO.14.8	The L
EXO.14.9	Then the Egyptians chased after them 
EXO.14.10	As Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel looked, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they became very frightened; so the sons of Israel cried out to the L
EXO.14.11	Then they said to Moses, “Is it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you dealt with us in this way, bringing us out of Egypt? 
EXO.14.12	Is this not the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.”
EXO.14.13	But Moses said to the people, “Do not fear! Stand by and see the salvation of the L
EXO.14.14	The L
EXO.14.15	Then the L
EXO.14.16	As for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, and the sons of Israel shall go through the midst of the sea on dry land. 
EXO.14.17	As for Me, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen. 
EXO.14.18	Then the Egyptians will know that I am the L
EXO.14.19	The angel of God, who had been going before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them. 
EXO.14.20	So it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud along with the darkness, yet it gave light at night. Thus the one did not come near the other all night.
EXO.14.21	Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the L
EXO.14.22	The sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on the dry land, and the waters 
EXO.14.23	Then the Egyptians took up the pursuit, and all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots and his horsemen went in after them into the midst of the sea. 
EXO.14.24	At the morning watch, the L
EXO.14.25	He caused their chariot wheels to swerve, and He made them drive with difficulty; so the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from Israel, for the L
EXO.14.26	Then the L
EXO.14.27	So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal state at daybreak, while the Egyptians were fleeing right into it; then the L
EXO.14.28	The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even Pharaoh’s entire army that had gone into the sea after them; not even one of them remained. 
EXO.14.29	But the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea, and the waters 
EXO.14.30	Thus the L
EXO.14.31	When Israel saw the great power which the L
EXO.15.1	Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the L
EXO.15.1	“I will sing to the L
EXO.15.1	The horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea.
EXO.15.2	The L
EXO.15.2	And He has become my salvation;

EXO.15.2	My father’s God, and I will extol Him.
EXO.15.3	The L
EXO.15.3	The L
EXO.15.4	Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has cast into the sea;
EXO.15.4	And the choicest of his officers are drowned in the 
EXO.15.5	The deeps cover them;
EXO.15.5	They went down into the depths like a stone.
EXO.15.6	Your right hand, O L
EXO.15.6	Your right hand, O L
EXO.15.7	And in the greatness of Your excellence You overthrow those who rise up against You;
EXO.15.7	You send forth Your burning anger, 
EXO.15.8	At the blast of Your nostrils the waters were piled up,
EXO.15.8	The flowing waters stood up like a heap;
EXO.15.8	The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
EXO.15.9	The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;
EXO.15.9	My desire shall be gratified against them;
EXO.15.9	I will draw out my sword, my hand will destroy them.’
EXO.15.10	You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them;
EXO.15.10	They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
EXO.15.11	Who is like You among the gods, O L
EXO.15.11	Who is like You, majestic in holiness,
EXO.15.11	Awesome in praises, working wonders?
EXO.15.12	You stretched out Your right hand,
EXO.15.12	The earth swallowed them.
EXO.15.13	In Your lovingkindness You have led the people whom You have redeemed;
EXO.15.13	In Your strength You have guided 
EXO.15.14	The peoples have heard, they tremble;
EXO.15.14	Anguish has gripped the inhabitants of Philistia.
EXO.15.15	Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed;
EXO.15.15	The leaders of Moab, trembling grips them;
EXO.15.15	All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.
EXO.15.16	Terror and dread fall upon them;
EXO.15.16	By the greatness of Your arm they are motionless as stone;
EXO.15.16	Until Your people pass over, O L
EXO.15.16	Until the people pass over whom You have purchased.
EXO.15.17	You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance,
EXO.15.17	The place, O L
EXO.15.17	The sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established.
EXO.15.18	The L
EXO.15.19	For the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea, and the L
EXO.15.20	Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took the timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancing. 
EXO.15.21	Miriam answered them,
EXO.15.21	“Sing to the L
EXO.15.21	The horse and his rider He has hurled into the sea.”
EXO.15.22	Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water. 
EXO.15.23	When they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore it was named 
EXO.15.24	So the people grumbled at Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?” 
EXO.15.25	Then he cried out to the L
EXO.15.26	And He said, “If you will give earnest heed to the voice of the L
EXO.15.27	Then they came to Elim where there 
EXO.16.1	Then they set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt. 
EXO.16.2	The whole congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. 
EXO.16.3	The sons of Israel said to them, “Would that we had died by the L
EXO.16.4	Then the L
EXO.16.5	On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.” 
EXO.16.6	So Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, “At evening you will know that the L
EXO.16.7	and in the morning you will see the glory of the L
EXO.16.8	Moses said, “
EXO.16.9	Then Moses said to Aaron, “Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, ‘Come near before the L
EXO.16.10	It came about as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the L
EXO.16.11	And the L
EXO.16.12	“I have heard the grumblings of the sons of Israel; speak to them, saying, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the L
EXO.16.13	So it came about at evening that the quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. 
EXO.16.14	When the layer of dew evaporated, behold, on the surface of the wilderness there was a fine flake-like thing, fine as the frost on the ground. 
EXO.16.15	When the sons of Israel saw 
EXO.16.16	This is what the L
EXO.16.17	The sons of Israel did so, and 
EXO.16.18	When they measured it with an omer, he who had gathered much had no excess, and he who had gathered little had no lack; every man gathered as much as he should eat. 
EXO.16.19	Moses said to them, “Let no man leave any of it until morning.” 
EXO.16.20	But they did not listen to Moses, and some left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them. 
EXO.16.21	They gathered it morning by morning, every man as much as he should eat; but when the sun grew hot, it would melt.
EXO.16.22	Now on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. When all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses, 
EXO.16.23	then he said to them, “This is what the L
EXO.16.24	So they put it aside until morning, as Moses had ordered, and it did not become foul nor was there any worm in it. 
EXO.16.25	Moses said, “Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the L
EXO.16.26	Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, 
EXO.16.27	It came about on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, but they found none. 
EXO.16.28	Then the L
EXO.16.29	See, the L
EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
EXO.16.31	The house of Israel named it manna, and it was like coriander seed, white, and its taste was like wafers with honey. 
EXO.16.32	Then Moses said, “This is what the L
EXO.16.33	Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put an omerful of manna in it, and place it before the L
EXO.16.34	As the L
EXO.16.35	The sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan. 
EXO.16.36	(Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.)
EXO.17.1	Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel journeyed by stages from the wilderness of Sin, according to the command of the L
EXO.17.2	Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water that we may drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the L
EXO.17.3	But the people thirsted there for water; and they grumbled against Moses and said, “Why, now, have you brought us up from Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?” 
EXO.17.4	So Moses cried out to the L
EXO.17.5	Then the L
EXO.17.6	Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.” And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
EXO.17.7	He named the place 
EXO.17.8	Then Amalek came and fought against Israel at Rephidim. 
EXO.17.9	So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men for us and go out, fight against Amalek. Tomorrow I will station myself on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.” 
EXO.17.10	Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought against Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
EXO.17.11	So it came about when Moses held his hand up, that Israel prevailed, and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed. 
EXO.17.12	But Moses’ hands were heavy. Then they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other. Thus his hands were steady until the sun set. 
EXO.17.13	So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
EXO.17.14	Then the L
EXO.17.15	Moses built an altar and named it The L
EXO.17.16	and he said, “The L
EXO.18.1	Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people, how the L
EXO.18.2	Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Moses’ wife Zipporah, after he had sent her away, 
EXO.18.3	and her two sons, of whom one was named Gershom, for Moses said, “I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.” 
EXO.18.4	The other was named Eliezer, for 
EXO.18.5	Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was camped, at the mount of God. 
EXO.18.6	He sent word to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her.” 
EXO.18.7	Then Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent. 
EXO.18.8	Moses told his father-in-law all that the L
EXO.18.9	Jethro rejoiced over all the goodness which the L
EXO.18.10	So Jethro said, “Blessed be the L
EXO.18.11	Now I know that the L
EXO.18.12	Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law before God.
EXO.18.13	It came about the next day that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood about Moses from the morning until the evening. 
EXO.18.14	Now when Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, “What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit 
EXO.18.15	Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God. 
EXO.18.16	When they have a dispute, it comes to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor and make known the statutes of God and His laws.”
EXO.18.17	Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you are doing is not good. 
EXO.18.18	You will surely wear out, both yourself and these people who are with you, for the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone. 
EXO.18.19	Now listen to me: I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You be the people’s representative before God, and you bring the disputes to God, 
EXO.18.20	then teach them the statutes and the laws, and make known to them the way in which they are to walk and the work they are to do. 
EXO.18.21	Furthermore, you shall select out of all the people able men who fear God, men of truth, those who hate dishonest gain; and you shall place 
EXO.18.22	Let them judge the people at all times; and let it be that every major dispute they will bring to you, but every minor dispute they themselves will judge. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear 
EXO.18.23	If you do this thing and God 
EXO.18.24	So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said. 
EXO.18.25	Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people, leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens. 
EXO.18.26	They judged the people at all times; the difficult dispute they would bring to Moses, but every minor dispute they themselves would judge. 
EXO.18.27	Then Moses bade his father-in-law farewell, and he went his way into his own land.
EXO.19.1	In the third month after the sons of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that very day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. 
EXO.19.2	When they set out from Rephidim, they came to the wilderness of Sinai and camped in the wilderness; and there Israel camped in front of the mountain. 
EXO.19.3	Moses went up to God, and the L
EXO.19.4	‘You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and 
EXO.19.5	Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My 
EXO.19.6	and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel.”
EXO.19.7	So Moses came and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the L
EXO.19.8	All the people answered together and said, “All that the L
EXO.19.9	The L
EXO.19.10	The L
EXO.19.11	and let them be ready for the third day, for on the third day the L
EXO.19.12	You shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, ‘Beware that you do not go up on the mountain or touch the border of it; whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death. 
EXO.19.13	No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or 
EXO.19.14	So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people, and they washed their garments. 
EXO.19.15	He said to the people, “Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman.”
EXO.19.16	So it came about on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunder and lightning flashes and a thick cloud upon the mountain and a very loud trumpet sound, so that all the people who 
EXO.19.17	And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
EXO.19.18	Now Mount Sinai 
EXO.19.19	When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with thunder. 
EXO.19.20	The L
EXO.19.21	Then the L
EXO.19.22	Also let the priests who come near to the L
EXO.19.23	Moses said to the L
EXO.19.24	Then the L
EXO.19.25	So Moses went down to the people and told them.
EXO.20.1	Then God spoke all these words, saying,
EXO.20.2	“I am the L
EXO.20.3	“You shall have no other gods 
EXO.20.4	“You shall not make for yourself 
EXO.20.5	You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the L
EXO.20.6	but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.
EXO.20.7	“You shall not take the name of the L
EXO.20.8	“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
EXO.20.9	Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 
EXO.20.10	but the seventh day is a sabbath of the L
EXO.20.11	For in six days the L
EXO.20.12	“Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be prolonged in the land which the L
EXO.20.13	“You shall not murder.
EXO.20.14	“You shall not commit adultery.
EXO.20.15	“You shall not steal.
EXO.20.16	“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
EXO.20.17	“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
EXO.20.18	All the people perceived the thunder and the lightning flashes and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw 
EXO.20.19	Then they said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself and we will listen; but let not God speak to us, or we will die.” 
EXO.20.20	Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid; for God has come in order to test you, and in order that the fear of Him may remain with you, so that you may not sin.” 
EXO.20.21	So the people stood at a distance, while Moses approached the thick cloud where God 
EXO.20.22	Then the L
EXO.20.23	You shall not make 
EXO.20.24	You shall make an altar of earth for Me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you. 
EXO.20.25	If you make an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build it of cut stones, for if you wield your tool on it, you will profane it. 
EXO.20.26	And you shall not go up by steps to My altar, so that your nakedness will not be exposed on it.’
EXO.21.1	“Now these are the ordinances which you are to set before them:
EXO.21.2	“If you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve for six years; but on the seventh he shall go out as a free man without payment. 
EXO.21.3	If he comes alone, he shall go out alone; if he is the husband of a wife, then his wife shall go out with him. 
EXO.21.4	If his master gives him a wife, and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall go out alone. 
EXO.21.5	But if the slave plainly says, ‘I love my master, my wife and my children; I will not go out as a free man,’ 
EXO.21.6	then his master shall bring him to 
EXO.21.7	“If a man sells his daughter as a female slave, she is not to go free as the male slaves do. 
EXO.21.8	If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master who designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He does not have authority to sell her to a foreign people because of his unfairness to her. 
EXO.21.9	If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her according to the custom of daughters. 
EXO.21.10	If he takes to himself another woman, he may not reduce her food, her clothing, or her conjugal rights. 
EXO.21.11	If he will not do these three 
EXO.21.12	“He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death. 
EXO.21.13	But if he did not lie in wait 
EXO.21.14	If, however, a man acts presumptuously toward his neighbor, so as to kill him craftily, you are to take him 
EXO.21.15	“He who strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
EXO.21.16	“He who kidnaps a man, whether he sells him or he is found in his possession, shall surely be put to death.
EXO.21.17	“He who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
EXO.21.18	“If men have a quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with 
EXO.21.19	if he gets up and walks around outside on his staff, then he who struck him shall go unpunished; he shall only pay for his loss of time, and shall take care of him until he is completely healed.
EXO.21.20	“If a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod and he dies at his hand, he shall be punished. 
EXO.21.21	If, however, he survives a day or two, no vengeance shall be taken; for he is his property.
EXO.21.22	“If men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she gives birth prematurely, yet there is no injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman’s husband may demand of him, and he shall pay as the judges

EXO.31.18	When He had finished speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, He gave Moses the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God.
EXO.32.1	Now when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people assembled about Aaron and said to him, “Come, make us a god who will go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.” 
EXO.32.2	Aaron said to them, “Tear off the gold rings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring

EXO.32.5	Now when Aaron saw 
EXO.32.6	So the next day they rose early and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
EXO.32.7	Then the L
EXO.32.8	They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them. They have made for themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it and have sacrificed to it and said, ‘This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!’ ” 
EXO.32.9	The L
EXO.32.10	Now then let Me alone, that My anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them; and I will make of you a great nation.”
EXO.32.11	Then Moses entreated the L
EXO.32.12	Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, ‘With evil 
EXO.32.13	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants to whom You swore by Yourself, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit 
EXO.32.14	So the L
EXO.32.15	Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets which were written on both sides; they were written on one 
EXO.32.16	The tablets were God’s work, and the writing was God’s writing engraved on the tablets. 
EXO.32.17	Now when Joshua heard the sound of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is a sound of war in the camp.” 
EXO.32.18	But he said,
EXO.32.18	“It is not the sound of the cry of triumph,
EXO.32.18	Nor is it the sound of the cry of defeat;
EXO.32.18	But the sound of singing I hear.”
EXO.32.19	It came about, as soon as Moses came near the camp, that he saw the calf and 
EXO.32.20	He took the calf which they had made and burned 
EXO.32.21	Then Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you, that you have brought 
EXO.32.22	Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord burn; you know the people yourself, that they are prone to evil. 
EXO.32.23	For they said to me, ‘Make a god for us who will go before us; for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’ 
EXO.32.24	I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let them tear it off.’ So they gave 
EXO.32.25	Now when Moses saw that the people were out of control—for Aaron had let them get out of control to be a derision among their enemies— 
EXO.32.26	then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Whoever is for the L
EXO.32.27	He said to them, “Thus says the L
EXO.32.28	So the sons of Levi did as Moses instructed, and about three thousand men of the people fell that day. 
EXO.32.29	Then Moses said, “Dedicate yourselves today to the L
EXO.32.30	On the next day Moses said to the people, “You yourselves have committed a great sin; and now I am going up to the L

EXO.32.32	But now, if You will, forgive their sin—and if not, please blot me out from Your book which You have written!” 
EXO.32.33	The L
EXO.32.34	But go now, lead the people where I told you. Behold, My angel shall go before you; nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin.” 
EXO.32.35	Then the L
EXO.33.1	Then the L
EXO.33.2	I will send an angel before you and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite.

EXO.33.4	When the people heard this sad word, they went into mourning, and none of them put on his ornaments. 
EXO.33.5	For the L
EXO.33.6	So the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb 
EXO.33.7	Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, a good distance from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting. And everyone who sought the L
EXO.33.8	And it came about, whenever Moses went out to the tent, that all the people would arise and stand, each at the entrance of his tent, and gaze after Moses until he entered the tent. 
EXO.33.9	Whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent; and the L
EXO.33.10	When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would arise and worship, each at the entrance of his tent. 
EXO.33.11	Thus the L
EXO.33.12	Then Moses said to the L
EXO.33.13	Now therefore, I pray You, if I have found favor in Your sight, let me know Your ways that I may know You, so that I may find favor in Your sight. Consider too, that this nation is Your people.” 
EXO.33.14	And He said, “My presence shall go 
EXO.33.15	Then he said to Him, “If Your presence does not go 
EXO.33.16	For how then can it be known that I have found favor in Your sight, I and Your people? Is it not by Your going with us, so that we, I and Your people, may be distinguished from all the 
EXO.33.17	The L
EXO.33.18	Then Moses said, “I pray You, show me Your glory!” 
EXO.33.19	And He said, “I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the L
EXO.33.20	But He said, “You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live!” 
EXO.33.21	Then the L
EXO.33.22	and it will come about, while My glory is passing by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by. 
EXO.33.23	Then I will take My hand away and you shall see My back, but My face shall not be seen.”
EXO.34.1	Now the L
EXO.34.2	So be ready by morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to Me on the top of the mountain. 
EXO.34.3	No man is to come up with you, nor let any man be seen anywhere on the mountain; even the flocks and the herds may not graze in front of that mountain.” 
EXO.34.4	So he cut out two stone tablets like the former ones, and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai, as the L

EXO.34.6	Then the L
EXO.34.7	who keeps lovingkindness for thousands, who forgives iniquity, transgression and sin; yet He will by no means leave 
EXO.34.8	Moses made haste to bow low toward the earth and worship. 
EXO.34.9	He said, “If now I have found favor in Your sight, O Lord, I pray, let the Lord go along in our midst, even though the people are so obstinate, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us as Your own possession.”
EXO.34.10	Then God said, “Behold, I am going to make a covenant. Before all your people I will perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth nor among any of the nations; and all the people among whom you live will see the working of the L
EXO.34.11	“Be sure to observe what I am commanding you this day: behold, I am going to drive out the Amorite before you, and the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite. 
EXO.34.12	Watch yourself that you make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land into which you are going, or it will become a snare in your midst. 
EXO.34.13	But 
EXO.34.14	—for you shall not worship any other god, for the L
EXO.34.15	otherwise you might make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they would play the harlot with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and someone might invite you to eat of his sacrifice, 
EXO.34.16	and you might take some of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters might play the harlot with their gods and cause your sons 
EXO.34.17	You shall make for yourself no molten gods.
EXO.34.18	“You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt.
EXO.34.19	“The first offspring from every womb belongs to Me, and all your male livestock, the first offspring from cattle and sheep. 
EXO.34.20	You shall redeem with a lamb the first offspring from a donkey; and if you do not redeem

EXO.34.26	“You shall bring the very first of the first fruits of your soil into the house of the L
EXO.34.26	“
EXO.34.27	Then the L
EXO.34.28	So he was there with the L
EXO.34.29	It came about when Moses was coming down from Mount Sinai (and the two tablets of the testimony 
EXO.34.30	So when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him. 
EXO.34.31	Then Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers in the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them. 
EXO.34.32	Afterward all the sons of Israel came near, and he commanded them 
EXO.34.33	When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face. 
EXO.34.34	But whenever Moses went in before the L
EXO.34.35	the sons of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone. So Moses would replace the veil over his face until he went in to speak with Him.
EXO.35.1	Then Moses assembled all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and said to them, “These are the things that the L
EXO.35.2	“For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a holy 
EXO.35.3	You shall not kindle a fire in any of your dwellings on the sabbath day.”
EXO.35.4	Moses spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, “This is the thing which the L
EXO.35.5	‘Take from among you a contribution to the L

EXO.35.20	Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel departed from Moses’ presence. 
EXO.35.21	Everyone whose heart stirred him and everyone whose spirit moved him came 
EXO.35.22	Then all whose hearts moved them, both men and women, came 
EXO.35.23	Every man, who had in his possession blue and purple and scarlet 
EXO.35.24	Everyone who could make a contribution of silver and bronze brought the L
EXO.35.25	All the skilled women spun with their hands, and brought what they had spun, 
EXO.35.26	All the women whose heart stirred with a skill spun the goats’ 
EXO.35.27	The rulers brought the onyx stones and the stones for setting for the ephod and for the breastpiece; 
EXO.35.28	and the spice and the oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense. 
EXO.35.29	The Israelites, all the men and women, whose heart moved them to bring

EXO.35.34	He also has put in his heart to teach, both he and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
EXO.35.35	He has filled them with skill to perform every work of an engraver and of a designer and of an embroiderer, in blue and in purple 
EXO.36.1	“Now Bezalel and Oholiab, and every skillful person in whom the L

EXO.36.3	They received from Moses all the contributions which the sons of Israel had brought to perform the work in the construction of the sanctuary. And they still 
EXO.36.4	And all the skillful men who were performing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work which he was performing, 
EXO.36.5	and they said to Moses, “The people are bringing much more than enough for the construction work which the L
EXO.36.6	So Moses issued a command, and a proclamation was circulated throughout the camp, saying, “Let no man or woman any longer perform work for the contributions of the sanctuary.” Thus the people were restrained from bringing 
EXO.36.7	For the material they had was sufficient and more than enough for all the work, to perform it.
EXO.36.8	All the skillful men among those who were performing the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twisted linen and blue and purple and scarlet 
EXO.36.9	The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits and the width of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains had the same measurements. 
EXO.36.10	He joined five curtains to one another and 
EXO.36.11	He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set; he did likewise on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set. 
EXO.36.12	He made fifty loops in the one curtain and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite each other. 
EXO.36.13	He made fifty clasps of gold and joined the curtains to one another with the clasps, so the tabernacle was a unit.
EXO.36.14	Then he made curtains of goats’ 
EXO.36.15	The length of each curtain 
EXO.36.16	He joined five curtains by themselves and 
EXO.36.17	Moreover, he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the 
EXO.36.18	He made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together so that it would be a unit. 
EXO.36.19	He made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of porpoise skins above.
EXO.36.20	Then he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright. 
EXO.36.21	Ten cubits 
EXO.36.22	 two tenons for each board, fitted to one another; thus he did for all the boards of the tabernacle. 
EXO.36.23	He made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side; 
EXO.36.24	and he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. 
EXO.36.25	Then for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards, 
EXO.36.26	and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board and two sockets under another board. 
EXO.36.27	For the rear of the tabernacle, to the west, he made six boards. 
EXO.36.28	He made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear. 
EXO.36.29	They were double beneath, and together they were complete to its top to the first ring; thus he did with both of them for the two corners. 
EXO.36.30	There were eight boards with their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets, two under every board.
EXO.36.31	Then he made bars of acacia wood, five for the boards of one side of the tabernacle, 
EXO.36.32	and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the rear 
EXO.36.33	He made the middle bar to pass through in the center of the boards from end to end. 
EXO.36.34	He overlaid the boards with gold and made their rings of gold 
EXO.36.35	Moreover, he made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet 
EXO.36.36	He made four pillars of acacia for it, and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold; and he cast four sockets of silver for them. 
EXO.36.37	He made a screen for the doorway of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet 
EXO.36.38	and 
EXO.37.1	Now Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; its length was two and a half cubits, and its width one and a half cubits, and its height one and a half cubits; 
EXO.37.2	and he overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, and made a gold molding for it all around. 
EXO.37.3	He cast four rings of gold for it on its four feet; even two rings on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. 
EXO.37.4	He made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 
EXO.37.5	He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry it. 
EXO.37.6	He made a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide. 
EXO.37.7	He made two cherubim of gold; he made them of hammered work at the two ends of the mercy seat; 
EXO.37.8	one cherub at the one end and one cherub at the other end; he made the cherubim

EXO.37.11	He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a gold molding for it all around. 
EXO.37.12	He made a rim for it of a handbreadth all around, and made a gold molding for its rim all around. 
EXO.37.13	He cast four gold rings for it and put the rings on the four corners that were on its four feet. 
EXO.37.14	Close by the rim were the rings, the holders for the poles to carry the table. 
EXO.37.15	He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table. 
EXO.37.16	He made the utensils which were on the table, its dishes and its pans and its bowls and its jars, with which to pour out drink offerings, of pure gold.
EXO.37.17	Then he made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work, its base and its shaft; its cups, its bulbs and its flowers were 
EXO.37.18	There were six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand from the one side of it and three branches of the lampstand from the other side of it;

EXO.38.2	He made its horns on its four corners, its horns being 
EXO.38.3	He made all the utensils of the altar, the pails and the shovels and the basins, the flesh hooks and the firepans; he made all its utensils of bronze. 
EXO.38.4	He made for the altar a grating of bronze network beneath, under its ledge, reaching halfway up. 
EXO.38.5	He cast four rings on the four ends of the bronze grating 
EXO.38.6	He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. 
EXO.38.7	He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it. He made it hollow with planks.
EXO.38.8	Moreover, he made the laver of bronze with its base of bronze, from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
EXO.38.9	Then he made the court: for the south side the hangings of the court were of fine twisted linen, one hundred cubits;

EXO.38.31	and the sockets of the court all around and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pegs of the tabernacle and all the pegs of the court all around.
EXO.39.1	Moreover, from the blue and purple and scarlet

EXO.39.7	And he placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, 
EXO.39.8	He made the breastpiece, the work of a skillful workman, like the workmanship of the ephod: of gold 
EXO.39.9	It was square; they made the breastpiece folded double, a span long and a span wide when folded double. 
EXO.39.10	And they mounted four rows of stones on it. The first row 
EXO.39.11	and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire and a diamond; 
EXO.39.12	and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 
EXO.39.13	and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were set in gold filigree 
EXO.39.14	The stones were corresponding to the names of the sons of Israel; they were twelve, corresponding to their names,

EXO.39.21	They bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it would be on the woven band of the ephod, and that the breastpiece would not come loose from the ephod, just as the L

EXO.39.25	They also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates all around on the hem of the robe, 
EXO.39.26	alternating a bell and a pomegranate all around on the hem of the robe for the service, just as the L
EXO.39.27	They made the tunics of finely woven linen for Aaron and his sons,

EXO.39.41	the woven garments for ministering in the holy place and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests. 
EXO.39.42	So the sons of Israel did all the work according to all that the L

EXO.40.4	You shall bring in the table and arrange what belongs on it; and you shall bring in the lampstand and mount its lamps. 
EXO.40.5	Moreover, you shall set the gold altar of incense before the ark of the testimony, and set up the veil for the doorway to the tabernacle. 
EXO.40.6	You shall set the altar of burnt offering in front of the doorway of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.

EXO.40.9	Then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and shall consecrate it and all its furnishings; and it shall be holy. 
EXO.40.10	You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar, and the altar shall be most holy. 
EXO.40.11	You shall anoint the laver and its stand, and consecrate it. 
EXO.40.12	Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the doorway of the tent of meeting and wash them with water. 
EXO.40.13	You shall put the holy garments on Aaron and anoint him and consecrate him, that he may minister as a priest to Me. 
EXO.40.14	You shall bring his sons and put tunics on them;

EXO.40.23	He set the arrangement of bread in order on it before the L

EXO.40.25	He lighted the lamps before the L

EXO.40.29	He set the altar of burnt offering 
EXO.40.30	He placed the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing. 
EXO.40.31	From it Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet. 
EXO.40.32	When they entered the tent of meeting, and when they approached the altar, they washed, just as the L

LEV.6.27	Anyone who touches its flesh will become consecrated; and when any of its blood splashes on a garment, in a holy place you shall wash what was splashed on. 
LEV.6.28	Also the earthenware vessel in which it was boiled shall be broken; and if it was boiled in a bronze vessel, then it shall be scoured and rinsed in water. 
LEV.6.29	Every male among the priests may eat of it; it is most holy. 
LEV.6.30	But no sin offering of which any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place shall be eaten; it shall be burned with fire.

LEV.7.5	The priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire to the L
LEV.7.6	Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy. 
LEV.7.7	The guilt offering is like the sin offering, there is one law for them; the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it. 
LEV.7.8	Also the priest who presents any man’s burnt offering, that priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has presented. 
LEV.7.9	Likewise, every grain offering that is baked in the oven and everything prepared in a pan or on a griddle shall belong to the priest who presents it. 
LEV.7.10	Every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron, to all alike.

LEV.7.32	You shall give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifices of your peace offerings. 
LEV.7.33	The one among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat, the right thigh shall be his as

LEV.8.3	and assemble all the congregation at the doorway of the tent of meeting.” 
LEV.8.4	So Moses did just as the L
LEV.8.5	Moses said to the congregation, “This is the thing which the L
LEV.8.6	Then Moses had Aaron and his sons come near and washed them with water. 
LEV.8.7	He put the tunic on him and girded him with the sash, and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him; and he girded him with the artistic band of the ephod, with which he tied 
LEV.8.8	He then placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put 
LEV.8.9	He also placed the turban on his head, and on the turban, at its front, he placed the golden plate, the holy crown, just as the L
LEV.8.10	Moses then took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them. 
LEV.8.11	He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them. 
LEV.8.12	Then he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, to consecrate him. 
LEV.8.13	Next Moses had Aaron’s sons come near and clothed them with tunics, and girded them with sashes and bound caps on them, just as the L
LEV.8.14	Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering. 
LEV.8.15	Next Moses slaughtered 
LEV.8.16	He also took all the fat that was on the entrails and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat; and Moses offered it up in smoke on the altar. 
LEV.8.17	But the bull and its hide and its flesh and its refuse he burned in the fire outside the camp, just as the L
LEV.8.18	Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
LEV.8.19	Moses slaughtered 
LEV.8.20	When he had cut the ram into its pieces, Moses offered up the head and the pieces and the suet in smoke. 
LEV.8.21	After he had washed the entrails and the legs with water, Moses offered up the whole ram in smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a soothing aroma; it was an offering by fire to the L
LEV.8.22	Then he presented the second ram, the ram of 
LEV.8.23	Moses slaughtered 
LEV.8.24	He also had Aaron’s sons come near; and Moses put some of the blood on the lobe of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot. Moses then sprinkled 
LEV.8.25	He took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the entrails, and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right thigh. 
LEV.8.26	From the basket of unleavened bread that was before the L
LEV.8.27	He then put all 
LEV.8.28	Then Moses took them from their hands and offered them up in smoke on the altar with the burnt offering. They were an ordination offering for a soothing aroma; it was an offering by fire to the L
LEV.8.29	Moses also took the breast and presented it for a wave offering before the L
LEV.8.30	So Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he consecrated Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
LEV.8.31	Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the flesh at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and eat it there together with the bread which is in the basket of the ordination offering, just as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’ 
LEV.8.32	The remainder of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn in the fire. 
LEV.8.33	You shall not go outside the doorway of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the day that the period of your ordination is fulfilled; for he will ordain you through seven days. 
LEV.8.34	The L
LEV.8.35	At the doorway of the tent of meeting, moreover, you shall remain day and night for seven days and keep the charge of the L
LEV.8.36	Thus Aaron and his sons did all the things which the L
LEV.9.1	Now it came about on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel; 
LEV.9.2	and he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a calf, a bull, for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, 
LEV.9.3	Then to the sons of Israel you shall speak, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both one year old, without defect, for a burnt offering, 
LEV.9.4	and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the L
LEV.9.5	So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the whole congregation came near and stood before the L
LEV.9.6	Moses said, “This is the thing which the L
LEV.9.7	Moses then said to Aaron, “Come near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, that you may make atonement for yourself and for the people; then make the offering for the people, that you may make atonement for them, just as the L
LEV.9.8	So Aaron came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering which was for himself. 
LEV.9.9	Aaron’s sons presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood and put 
LEV.9.10	The fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver of the sin offering, he then offered up in smoke on the altar just as the L
LEV.9.11	The flesh and the skin, however, he burned with fire outside the camp.
LEV.9.12	Then he slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 
LEV.9.13	They handed the burnt offering to him in pieces, with the head, and he offered 
LEV.9.14	He also washed the entrails and the legs, and offered 
LEV.9.15	Then he presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the first. 
LEV.9.16	He also presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance. 
LEV.9.17	Next he presented the grain offering, and filled his hand with some of it and offered 
LEV.9.18	Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 
LEV.9.19	As for the portions of fat from the ox and from the ram, the fat tail, and the 
LEV.9.20	they now placed the portions of fat on the breasts; and he offered them up in smoke on the altar. 
LEV.9.21	But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron presented as a wave offering before the L
LEV.9.22	Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he stepped down after making the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings. 
LEV.9.23	Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting. When they came out and blessed the people, the glory of the L
LEV.9.24	Then fire came out from before the L
LEV.10.1	Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took their respective firepans, and after putting fire in them, placed incense on it and offered strange fire before the L
LEV.10.2	And fire came out from the presence of the L
LEV.10.3	Then Moses said to Aaron, “It is what the L
LEV.10.3	‘By those who come near Me I will be treated as holy,
LEV.10.3	And before all the people I will be honored.’ ”
LEV.10.3	So Aaron, therefore, kept silent.
LEV.10.4	Moses called also to Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come forward, carry your relatives away from the front of the sanctuary to the outside of the camp.” 
LEV.10.5	So they came forward and carried them still in their tunics to the outside of the camp, as Moses had said. 
LEV.10.6	Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not 
LEV.10.7	You shall not even go out from the doorway of the tent of meeting, or you will die; for the L
LEV.10.8	The L
LEV.10.9	“Do not drink wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you come into the tent of meeting, so that you will not die—it is a perpetual statute throughout your generations— 
LEV.10.10	and so as to make a distinction between the holy and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean, 
LEV.10.11	and so as to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which the L
LEV.10.12	Then Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his surviving sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the grain offering that is left over from the L
LEV.10.13	You shall eat it, moreover, in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons’ due out of the L
LEV.10.14	The breast of the wave offering, however, and the thigh of the offering you may eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you; for they have been given as your due and your sons’ due out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the sons of Israel. 
LEV.10.15	The thigh offered by lifting up and the breast offered by waving they shall bring along with the offerings by fire of the portions of fat, to present as a wave offering before the L
LEV.10.16	But Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up! So he was angry with Aaron’s surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar, saying, 
LEV.10.17	“Why did you not eat the sin offering at the holy place? For it is most holy, and He gave it to you to bear away the guilt of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the L
LEV.10.18	Behold, since its blood had not been brought inside, into the sanctuary, you should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, just as I commanded.” 
LEV.10.19	But Aaron spoke to Moses, “Behold, this very day they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the L

LEV.11.5	Likewise, the shaphan, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you; 
LEV.11.6	the rabbit also, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you;

LEV.13.49	if the mark is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather, or in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, it is a leprous mark and shall be shown to the priest. 
LEV.13.50	Then the priest shall look at the mark and shall quarantine the article with the mark for seven days. 
LEV.13.51	He shall then look at the mark on the seventh day; if the mark has spread in the garment, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in the leather, whatever the purpose for which the leather is used, the mark is a leprous malignancy, it is unclean. 
LEV.13.52	So he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool or in linen, or any article of leather in which the mark occurs, for it is a leprous malignancy; it shall be burned in the fire.

LEV.25.41	He shall then go out from you, he and his sons with him, and shall go back to his family, that he may return to the property of his forefathers.

LEV.25.50	He then with his purchaser shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to him up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond to the number of years. 
LEV.25.51	If there are still many years, he shall refund part of his purchase price in proportion to them for his own redemption; 
LEV.25.52	and if few years remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so calculate with him. In proportion to his years he is to refund 
LEV.25.53	Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall not rule over him with severity in your sight.

LEV.26.17	I will set My face against you so that you will be struck down before your enemies; and those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when no one is pursuing you. 
LEV.26.18	If also after these things you do not obey Me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins. 
LEV.26.19	I will also break down your pride of power; I will also make your sky like iron and your earth like bronze.

LEV.26.24	then I will act with hostility against you; and I, even I, will strike you seven times for your sins. 
LEV.26.25	I will also bring upon you a sword which will execute vengeance for the covenant; and when you gather together into your cities, I will send pestilence among you, so that you shall be delivered into enemy hands. 
LEV.26.26	When I break your staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will bring back your bread 
LEV.26.27	‘Yet if in spite of this you do not obey Me, but act with hostility against Me, 
LEV.26.28	then I will act with wrathful hostility against you, and I, even I, will punish you seven times for your sins.

LEV.26.30	I then will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and heap your remains on the remains of your idols, for My soul shall abhor you. 
LEV.26.31	I will lay waste your cities as well and will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your soothing aromas. 
LEV.26.32	I will make the land desolate so that your enemies who settle in it will be appalled over it. 
LEV.26.33	You, however, I will scatter among the nations and will draw out a sword after you, as your land becomes desolate and your cities become waste.

NUM.13.6	from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh; 
NUM.13.7	from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph; 
NUM.13.8	from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun; 
NUM.13.9	from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu; 
NUM.13.10	from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi; 
NUM.13.11	from the tribe of Joseph, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi; 
NUM.13.12	from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli; 
NUM.13.13	from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael; 
NUM.13.14	from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi; 
NUM.13.15	from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 
NUM.13.16	These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; but Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua.
NUM.13.17	When Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, he said to them, “Go up there into the 
NUM.13.18	See what the land is like, and whether the people who live in it are strong 
NUM.13.19	How is the land in which they live, is it good or bad? And how are the cities in which they live, are 
NUM.13.20	How is the land, is it fat or lean? Are there trees in it or not? Make an effort then to get some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.
NUM.13.21	So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, at Lebo-hamath. 
NUM.13.22	When they had gone up into the Negev, they came to Hebron where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
NUM.13.23	Then they came to the valley of 
NUM.13.24	That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down from there.
NUM.13.25	When they returned from spying out the land, at the end of forty days, 
NUM.13.26	they proceeded to come to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; and they brought back word to them and to all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land. 
NUM.13.27	Thus they told him, and said, “We went in to the land where you sent us; and it certainly does flow with milk and honey, and this is its fruit. 
NUM.13.28	Nevertheless, the people who live in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified 
NUM.13.29	Amalek is living in the land of the Negev and the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites are living in the hill country, and the Canaanites are living by the sea and by the side of the Jordan.”
NUM.13.30	Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, “We should by all means go up and take possession of it, for we will surely overcome it.” 
NUM.13.31	But the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people, for they are too strong for us.” 
NUM.13.32	So they gave out to the sons of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, “The land through which we have gone, in spying it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in it are men of 
NUM.13.33	There also we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak are part of the Nephilim); and we became like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.”
NUM.14.1	Then all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people wept that night. 
NUM.14.2	All the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron; and the whole congregation said to them, “Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness! 
NUM.14.3	Why is the L
NUM.14.4	So they said to one another, “Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt.”
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in the presence of all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel. 
NUM.14.6	Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes; 
NUM.14.7	and they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, “The land which we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land.

NUM.14.24	But My servant Caleb, because he has had a different spirit and has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land which he entered, and his descendants shall take possession of it. 
NUM.14.25	Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys; turn tomorrow and set out to the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.”
NUM.14.26	The L

NUM.14.38	But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive out of those men who went to spy out the land.
NUM.14.39	When Moses spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people mourned greatly. 
NUM.14.40	In the morning, however, they rose up early and went up to the ridge of the hill country, saying, “Here we are; we have indeed sinned, but we will go up to the place which the L

NUM.16.14	Indeed, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor have you given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!”
NUM.16.15	Then Moses became very angry and said to the L

NUM.16.23	Then the L
NUM.16.24	“Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get back from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.’ ”
NUM.16.25	Then Moses arose and went to Dathan and Abiram, with the elders of Israel following him, 
NUM.16.26	and he spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart now from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing that belongs to them, or you will be swept away in all their sin.”

NUM.16.50	Then Aaron returned to Moses at the doorway of the tent of meeting, for the plague had been checked.
NUM.17.1	Then the L
NUM.17.2	“Speak to the sons of Israel, and get from them a rod for each father’s household: twelve rods, from all their leaders according to their fathers’ households. You shall write each name on his rod,

NUM.17.4	You shall then deposit them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony, where I meet with you. 
NUM.17.5	It will come about that the rod of the man whom I choose will sprout. Thus I will lessen from upon Myself the grumblings of the sons of Israel, who are grumbling against you.” 
NUM.17.6	Moses therefore spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their leaders gave him a rod apiece, for each leader according to their fathers’ households, twelve rods, with the rod of Aaron among their rods. 
NUM.17.7	So Moses deposited the rods before the L
NUM.17.8	Now on the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced blossoms, and it bore ripe almonds.

NUM.18.4	They shall be joined with you and attend to the obligations of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; but an outsider may not come near you. 
NUM.18.5	So you shall attend to the obligations of the sanctuary and the obligations of the altar, so that there will no longer be wrath on the sons of Israel. 
NUM.18.6	Behold, I Myself have taken your fellow Levites from among the sons of Israel; they are a gift to you, dedicated to the L

NUM.18.22	The sons of Israel shall not come near the tent of meeting again, or they will bear sin and die. 
NUM.18.23	Only the Levites shall perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, and among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance.

NUM.18.32	You will bear no sin by reason of it when you have offered the best of it. But you shall not profane the sacred gifts of the sons of Israel, or you will die.’ ”
NUM.19.1	Then the L
NUM.19.2	“This is the statute of the law which the L

NUM.19.4	Next Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle some of its blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times. 
NUM.19.5	Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight; its hide and its flesh and its blood, with its refuse, shall be burned. 
NUM.19.6	The priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet

NUM.19.8	The one who burns it shall also wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water, and shall be unclean until evening. 
NUM.19.9	Now a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and the congregation of the sons of Israel shall keep it as water to remove impurity; it is purification from sin.

NUM.20.2	There was no water for the congregation, and they assembled themselves against Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.20.3	The people thus contended with Moses and spoke, saying, “If only we had perished when our brothers perished before the L
NUM.20.4	Why then have you brought the L
NUM.20.5	Why have you made us come up from Egypt, to bring us in to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, nor is there water to drink.” 
NUM.20.6	Then Moses and Aaron came in from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. Then the glory of the L
NUM.20.7	and the L
NUM.20.8	“Take the rod; and you and your brother Aaron assemble the congregation and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it may yield its water. You shall thus bring forth water for them out of the rock and let the congregation and their beasts drink.”
NUM.20.9	So Moses took the rod from before the L
NUM.20.10	and Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock. And he said to them, “Listen now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?” 
NUM.20.11	Then Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation and their beasts drank. 
NUM.20.12	But the L
NUM.20.13	Those 
NUM.20.14	From Kadesh Moses then sent messengers to the king of Edom: “Thus your brother Israel has said, ‘You know all the hardship that has befallen us; 
NUM.20.15	that our fathers went down to Egypt, and we stayed in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians treated us and our fathers badly. 
NUM.20.16	But when we cried out to the L
NUM.20.17	Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard; we will not even drink water from a well. We will go along the king’s highway, not turning to the right or left, until we pass through your territory.’ ”
NUM.20.18	Edom, however, said to him, “You shall not pass through us, or I will come out with the sword against you.” 
NUM.20.19	Again, the sons of Israel said to him, “We will go up by the highway, and if I and my livestock do drink any of your water, then I will pay its price. Let me only pass through on my feet, nothing 
NUM.20.20	But he said, “You shall not pass through.” And Edom came out against him with a heavy force and with a strong hand. 
NUM.20.21	Thus Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory; so Israel turned away from him.
NUM.20.22	Now when they set out from Kadesh, the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.
NUM.20.23	Then the L
NUM.20.24	“Aaron will be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because you rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah. 
NUM.20.25	Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up to Mount Hor; 
NUM.20.26	and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar. So Aaron will be gathered 
NUM.20.27	So Moses did just as the L
NUM.20.28	After Moses had stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar, Aaron died there on the mountain top. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 
NUM.20.29	When all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.
NUM.21.1	When the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the

NUM.21.4	Then they set out from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the people became impatient because of the journey. 
NUM.21.5	The people spoke against God and Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this miserable food.”
NUM.21.6	The L
NUM.21.7	So the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned, because we have spoken against the L
NUM.21.8	Then the L
NUM.21.9	And Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on the standard; and it came about, that if a serpent bit any man, when he looked to the bronze serpent, he lived.
NUM.21.10	Now the sons of Israel moved out and camped in Oboth. 
NUM.21.11	They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness which is opposite Moab, to the east. 
NUM.21.12	From there they set out and camped in 
NUM.21.13	From there they journeyed and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 
NUM.21.14	Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the L
NUM.21.14	“Waheb in Suphah,
NUM.21.14	And the wadis of the Arnon,
NUM.21.15	And the slope of the wadis
NUM.21.15	That extends to the site of Ar,
NUM.21.15	And leans to the border of Moab.”
NUM.21.16	From there 
NUM.21.17	Then Israel sang this song:
NUM.21.17	“Spring up, O well! Sing to it!
NUM.21.18	The well, which the leaders sank,
NUM.21.18	Which the nobles of the people dug,
NUM.21.18	With the scepter 
NUM.21.18	And from the wilderness 
NUM.21.19	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
NUM.21.20	and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the land of Moab, at the top of Pisgah which overlooks the wasteland.
NUM.21.21	Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying, 
NUM.21.22	“Let me pass through your land. We will not turn off into field or vineyard; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the king’s highway until we have passed through your border.” 
NUM.21.23	But Sihon would not permit Israel to pass through his border. So Sihon gathered all his people and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel. 
NUM.21.24	Then Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the sons of Ammon; for the border of the sons of Ammon 
NUM.21.25	Israel took all these cities and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all her villages. 
NUM.21.26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon. 
NUM.21.27	Therefore those who use proverbs say,
NUM.21.27	“Come to Heshbon! Let it be built!
NUM.21.27	So let the city of Sihon be established.
NUM.21.28	For a fire went forth from Heshbon,
NUM.21.28	A flame from the town of Sihon;
NUM.21.28	It devoured Ar of Moab,
NUM.21.28	The dominant heights of the Arnon.
NUM.21.29	Woe to you, O Moab!
NUM.21.29	You are ruined, O people of Chemosh!
NUM.21.29	He has given his sons as fugitives,
NUM.21.29	And his daughters into captivity,
NUM.21.29	To an Amorite king, Sihon.
NUM.21.30	But we have cast them down,
NUM.21.30	Heshbon is ruined as far as Dibon,

NUM.22.1	Then the sons of Israel journeyed, and camped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan 
NUM.22.2	Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 
NUM.22.3	So Moab was in great fear because of the people, for they were numerous; and Moab was in dread of the sons of Israel. 
NUM.22.4	Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this horde will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.” And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.

NUM.22.12	God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.” 
NUM.22.13	So Balaam arose in the morning and said to Balak’s leaders, “Go back to your land, for the L
NUM.22.14	The leaders of Moab arose and went to Balak and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”
NUM.22.15	Then Balak again sent leaders, more numerous and more distinguished than the former. 
NUM.22.16	They came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, ‘Let nothing, I beg you, hinder you from coming to me;

NUM.22.30	The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I ever been accustomed to do so to you?” And he said, “No.”

NUM.22.37	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not urgently send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I really unable to honor you?” 
NUM.22.38	So Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come now to you! Am I able to speak anything at all? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak.”

NUM.23.28	So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor which overlooks the wasteland. 
NUM.23.29	Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.”

NUM.24.10	Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have persisted in blessing them these three times!

NUM.25.1	While Israel remained at Shittim, the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab.

NUM.25.7	When Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he arose from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand, 
NUM.25.8	and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and pierced both of them through, the man of Israel and the woman, through the body. So the plague on the sons of Israel was checked.

NUM.32.33	So Moses gave to them, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Joseph’s son Manasseh, the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan, the land with its cities with 
NUM.32.34	The sons of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer,

DEU.1.3	In the fortieth year, on the first 
DEU.1.4	after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei. 
DEU.1.5	Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to expound this law, saying,
DEU.1.6	“The L
DEU.1.7	Turn and set your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland and in the 
DEU.1.8	See, I have placed the land before you; go in and possess the land which the L
DEU.1.9	“I spoke to you at that time, saying, ‘I am not able to bear

DEU.1.11	May the L
DEU.1.12	How can I alone bear the load and burden of you and your strife? 
DEU.1.13	Choose wise and discerning and experienced men from your tribes, and I will appoint them as your heads.’ 
DEU.1.14	You answered me and said, ‘The thing which you have said to do is good.’ 
DEU.1.15	So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and appointed them heads over you, leaders of thousands and of hundreds, of fifties and of tens, and officers for your tribes.
DEU.1.16	“Then I charged your judges at that time, saying, ‘Hear 
DEU.1.17	You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not fear man, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.’ 
DEU.1.18	I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.
DEU.1.19	“Then we set out from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, just as the L
DEU.1.20	I said to you, ‘You have come to the hill country of the Amorites which the L

DEU.1.23	The thing pleased me and I took twelve of your men, one man for each tribe. 
DEU.1.24	They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol and spied it out. 
DEU.1.25	Then they took

DEU.1.27	and you grumbled in your tents and said, ‘Because the L
DEU.1.28	Where can we go up? Our brethren have made our hearts melt, saying, “The people are bigger and taller than we; the cities are large and fortified to heaven. And besides, we saw the sons of the Anakim there.” ’

DEU.1.39	Moreover, your little ones who you said would become a prey, and your sons, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, shall enter there, and I will give it to them and they shall possess it. 
DEU.1.40	But as for you, turn around and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.’
DEU.1.41	“Then you said to me, ‘We have sinned against the L

DEU.1.44	The Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do, and crushed you from Seir to Hormah. 
DEU.1.45	Then you returned and wept before the L

DEU.2.13	‘Now arise and cross over the brook Zered yourselves.’ So we crossed over the brook Zered. 
DEU.2.14	Now the time that it took for us to come from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war perished from within the camp, as the L

DEU.2.19	When you come opposite the sons of Ammon, do not harass them nor provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot as a possession.’ 
DEU.2.20	(It is also regarded as the land of the Rephaim, 
DEU.2.21	a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim, but the L
DEU.2.22	just as He did for the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them; they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day. 
DEU.2.23	And the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the 
DEU.2.24	‘Arise, set out, and pass through the valley of Arnon. Look! I have given Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand; begin to take possession and contend with him in battle. 
DEU.2.25	This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under the heavens, who, when they hear the report of you, will tremble and be in anguish because of you.’
DEU.2.26	“So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
DEU.2.27	‘Let me pass through your land, I will travel only on the highway; I will not turn aside to the right or to the left. 
DEU.2.28	You will sell me food for money so that I may eat, and give me water for money so that I may drink, only let me pass through on foot, 
DEU.2.29	just as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I cross over the Jordan into the land which the L
DEU.2.30	But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing for us to pass through his land; for the L

DEU.2.35	We took only the animals as our booty and the spoil of the cities which we had captured. 
DEU.2.36	From Aroer which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon and

DEU.3.4	We captured all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
DEU.3.5	All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates and bars, besides a great many unwalled towns. 
DEU.3.6	We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women and children of every city. 
DEU.3.7	But all the animals and the spoil of the cities we took as our booty.
DEU.3.8	“Thus we took the land at that time from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of Arnon to Mount Hermon 
DEU.3.9	(Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir): 
DEU.3.10	all the cities of the plateau and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
DEU.3.11	(For only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was an iron bedstead; it is in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon. Its length was nine cubits and its width four cubits by ordinary cubit.)
DEU.3.12	“So we took possession of this land at that time. From Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead and its cities I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites. 
DEU.3.13	The rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, all the region of Argob (concerning all Bashan, it is called the land of Rephaim. 
DEU.3.14	Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called it, 
DEU.3.15	To Machir I gave Gilead. 
DEU.3.16	To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even as far as the valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley as a border and as far as the river Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon; 
DEU.3.17	the Arabah also, with the Jordan as 
DEU.3.18	“Then I commanded you at that time, saying, ‘The L
DEU.3.19	But your wives and your little ones and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in your cities which I have given you, 
DEU.3.20	until the L
DEU.3.21	I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes have seen all that the L
DEU.3.22	Do not fear them, for the L

DEU.3.24	‘O Lord G

DEU.3.26	But the L
DEU.3.27	Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes to the west and north and south and east, and see 
DEU.3.28	But charge Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him, for he shall go across at the head of this people, and he will give them as an inheritance the land which you will see.’ 
DEU.3.29	So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
DEU.4.1	“Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching you to perform, so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land which the L

DEU.4.41	Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan to the east, 
DEU.4.42	that a manslayer might flee there, who unintentionally slew his neighbor without having enmity toward him in time past; and by fleeing to one of these cities he might live: 
DEU.4.43	Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.
DEU.4.44	Now this is the law which Moses set before the sons of Israel; 
DEU.4.45	these are the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, when they came out from Egypt, 
DEU.4.46	across the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel defeated when they came out from Egypt. 
DEU.4.47	They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, 
DEU.4.48	from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, even as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon), 
DEU.4.49	with all the Arabah across the Jordan to the east, even as far as the sea of the Arabah, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah.
DEU.5.1	Then Moses summoned all Israel and said to them:

DEU.31.18	But I will surely hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they will do, for they will turn to other gods.
DEU.31.19	“Now therefore, write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the sons of Israel; put it on their lips, so that this song may be a witness for Me against the sons of Israel. 
DEU.31.20	For when I bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to their fathers, and they have eaten and are satisfied and become prosperous, then they will turn to other gods and serve them, and spurn Me and break My covenant. 
DEU.31.21	Then it shall come about, when many evils and troubles have come upon them, that this song will testify before them as a witness (for it shall not be forgotten from the lips of their descendants); for I know their intent which they are developing today, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.” 
DEU.31.22	So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the sons of Israel.
DEU.31.23	Then He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring the sons of Israel into the land which I swore to them, and I will be with you.”

DEU.32.13	And He made him suck honey from the rock,
DEU.32.13	And oil from the flinty rock,

DEU.32.14	With fat of lambs,

DEU.32.45	When Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel, 
DEU.32.46	he said to them, “Take to your heart all the words with which I am warning you today, which you shall command your sons to observe carefully, 
DEU.32.47	For it is not an idle word for you; indeed it is your life. And by this word you will prolong your days in the land, which you are about to cross the Jordan to possess.”

DEU.32.50	Then die on the mountain where you ascend, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people, 
DEU.32.51	because you broke faith with Me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because you did not treat Me as holy in the midst of the sons of Israel. 
DEU.32.52	For you shall see the land at a distance, but you shall not go there, into the land which I am giving the sons of Israel.”
DEU.33.1	Now this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death.

DEU.33.16	Let it come to the head of Joseph,
DEU.33.16	And to the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers.
DEU.33.17	As the firstborn of his ox, majesty is his,
DEU.33.17	And his horns are the horns of the wild ox;
DEU.33.17	With them he will push the peoples,
DEU.33.17	All at once, 
DEU.33.17	And those are the ten thousands of Ephraim,
DEU.33.17	And those are the thousands of Manasseh.”
DEU.33.18	Of Zebulun he said,
DEU.33.18	“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going forth,
DEU.33.18	And, Issachar, in your tents.
DEU.33.19	They will call peoples 
DEU.33.19	There they will offer righteous sacrifices;
DEU.33.19	For they will draw out the abundance of the seas,
DEU.33.19	And the hidden treasures of the sand.”
DEU.33.20	Of Gad he said,
DEU.33.20	“Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad;
DEU.33.20	He lies down as a lion,
DEU.33.20	And tears the arm, also the crown of the head.
DEU.33.21	Then he provided the first 
DEU.33.21	For there the ruler’s portion was reserved;
DEU.33.21	And he came 
DEU.33.21	He executed the justice of the L
DEU.33.21	And His ordinances with Israel.”
DEU.33.22	Of Dan he said,
DEU.33.22	“Dan is a lion’s whelp,
DEU.33.22	That leaps forth from Bashan.”
DEU.33.23	Of Naphtali he said,
DEU.33.23	“O Naphtali, satisfied with favor,
DEU.33.23	And full of the blessing of the L
DEU.33.23	Take possession of the sea and the south.”
DEU.33.24	Of Asher he said,
DEU.33.24	“More blessed than sons is Asher;
DEU.33.24	May he be favored by his brothers,
DEU.33.24	And may he dip his foot in oil.
DEU.33.25	Your locks will be iron and bronze,

DEU.33.26	“There is none like the God of

DEU.33.27	And He drove out the enemy from before you,
DEU.33.27	And said, ‘Destroy!’
DEU.33.28	So Israel dwells in security,
DEU.33.28	The fountain of Jacob secluded,
DEU.33.28	In a land of grain and new wine;
DEU.33.28	His heavens also drop down dew.
DEU.33.29	Blessed are you, O Israel;

DEU.33.29	So your enemies will cringe before you,
DEU.33.29	And you will tread upon their high places.”
DEU.34.1	Now Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And the L
DEU.34.2	and all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the 
DEU.34.3	and the Negev and the plain in the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. 
DEU.34.4	Then the L
DEU.34.5	So Moses the servant of the L
DEU.34.6	And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor; but no man knows his burial place to this day. 
DEU.34.7	Although Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died, his eye was not dim, nor his vigor abated. 
DEU.34.8	So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; then the days of weeping 
DEU.34.9	Now Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; and the sons of Israel listened to him and did as the L
DEU.34.10	Since that time no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the L
DEU.34.11	for all the signs and wonders which the L
DEU.34.12	and for all the mighty power and for all the great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.
JOS.1.1	Now it came about after the death of Moses the servant of the L
JOS.1.2	“Moses My servant is dead; now therefore arise, cross this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel. 
JOS.1.3	Every place on which the sole of your foot treads, I have given it to you, just as I spoke to Moses. 
JOS.1.4	From the wilderness and this Lebanon, even as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun will be your territory. 
JOS.1.5	No man will 
JOS.1.6	Be strong and courageous, for you shall give this people possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. 
JOS.1.7	Only be strong and very courageous; be careful to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may have success wherever you go. 
JOS.1.8	This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success. 
JOS.1.9	Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous! Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the L
JOS.1.10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 
JOS.1.11	“Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are to cross this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the L
JOS.1.12	To the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, 
JOS.1.13	“Remember the word which Moses the servant of the L
JOS.1.14	Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but you shall cross before your brothers in battle array, all your valiant warriors, and shall help them, 
JOS.1.15	until the L
JOS.1.16	They answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. 
JOS.1.17	Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you; only may the L
JOS.1.18	Anyone who rebels against your command and does not obey your words in all that you command him, shall be put to death; only be strong and courageous.”
JOS.2.1	Then Joshua the son of Nun sent two men as spies secretly from Shittim, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” So they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lodged there. 
JOS.2.2	It was told the king of Jericho, saying, “Behold, men from the sons of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land.” 
JOS.2.3	And the king of Jericho sent 
JOS.2.4	But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them, and she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from. 
JOS.2.5	It came about when 
JOS.2.6	But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them in the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof. 
JOS.2.7	So the men pursued them on the road to the Jordan to the fords; and as soon as those who were pursuing them had gone out, they shut the gate.
JOS.2.8	Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof, 
JOS.2.9	and said to the men, “I know that the L
JOS.2.10	For we have heard how the L
JOS.2.11	When we heard 
JOS.2.12	Now therefore, please swear to me by the L
JOS.2.13	and spare my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters, with all who belong to them, and deliver our 
JOS.2.14	So the men said to her, “Our life for yours if you do not tell this business of ours; and it shall come about when the L
JOS.2.15	Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the city wall, so that she was living on the wall. 
JOS.2.16	She said to them, “Go to the hill country, so that the pursuers will not happen upon you, and hide yourselves there for three days until the pursuers return. Then afterward you may go on your way.” 
JOS.2.17	The men said to her, “We 
JOS.2.18	unless, when we come into the land, you tie this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down, and gather to yourself into the house your father and your mother and your brothers and all your father’s household. 
JOS.2.19	It shall come about that anyone who goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood 
JOS.2.20	But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be free from the oath which you have made us swear.” 
JOS.2.21	She said, “According to your words, so be it.” So she sent them away, and they departed; and she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
JOS.2.22	They departed and came to the hill country, and remained there for three days until the pursuers returned. Now the pursuers had sought 
JOS.2.23	Then the two men returned and came down from the hill country and crossed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and they related to him all that had happened to them. 
JOS.2.24	They said to Joshua, “Surely the L
JOS.3.1	Then Joshua rose early in the morning; and he and all the sons of Israel set out from Shittim and came to the Jordan, and they lodged there before they crossed. 
JOS.3.2	At the end of three days the officers went through the midst of the camp; 
JOS.3.3	and they commanded the people, saying, “When you see the ark of the covenant of the L
JOS.3.4	However, there shall be between you and it a distance of about 2,000 cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you shall go, for you have not passed this way before.”
JOS.3.5	Then Joshua said to the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the L
JOS.3.6	And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people.” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people.
JOS.3.7	Now the L
JOS.3.8	You shall, moreover, command the priests who are carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand 
JOS.3.9	Then Joshua said to the sons of Israel, “Come here, and hear the words of the L
JOS.3.10	Joshua said, “By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that He will assuredly dispossess from before you the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Jebusite. 
JOS.3.11	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over ahead of you into the Jordan. 
JOS.3.12	Now then, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe. 
JOS.3.13	It shall come about when the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the L
JOS.3.14	So when the people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan with the priests carrying the ark of the covenant before the people, 
JOS.3.15	and when those who carried the ark came into the Jordan, and the feet of the priests carrying the ark were dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the days of harvest), 
JOS.3.16	the waters which were flowing down from above stood 
JOS.3.17	And the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the L
JOS.4.1	Now when all the nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the L
JOS.4.2	“Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe, 
JOS.4.3	and command them, saying, ‘Take up for yourselves twelve stones from here out of the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the priests’ feet are standing firm, and carry them over with you and lay them down in the lodging place where you will lodge tonight.’ ” 
JOS.4.4	So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the sons of Israel, one man from each tribe; 
JOS.4.5	and Joshua said to them, “Cross again to the ark of the L
JOS.4.6	Let this be a sign among you, so that when your children ask later, saying, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’ 
JOS.4.7	then you shall say to them, ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the L
JOS.4.8	Thus the sons of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, just as the L
JOS.4.9	Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan at the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant were standing, and they are there to this day. 
JOS.4.10	For the priests who carried the ark were standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything was completed that the L
JOS.4.11	and when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of the L
JOS.4.12	The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over in battle array before the sons of Israel, just as Moses had spoken to them; 
JOS.4.13	about 40,000 equipped for war, crossed for battle before the L
JOS.4.14	On that day the L
JOS.4.15	Now the L
JOS.4.16	“Command the priests who carry the ark of the testimony that they come up from the Jordan.” 
JOS.4.17	So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.” 
JOS.4.18	It came about when the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the L
JOS.4.19	Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth of the first month and camped at Gilgal on the eastern edge of Jericho. 
JOS.4.20	Those twelve stones which they had taken from the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal. 
JOS.4.21	He said to the sons of Israel, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What are these stones?’ 
JOS.4.22	then you shall inform your children, saying, ‘Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.’ 
JOS.4.23	For the L
JOS.4.24	that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the L
JOS.5.1	Now it came about when all the kings of the Amorites who 
JOS.5.2	At that time the L
JOS.5.3	So Joshua made himself flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at 
JOS.5.4	This is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way after they came out of Egypt. 
JOS.5.5	For all the people who came out were circumcised, but all the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised. 
JOS.5.6	For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, 
JOS.5.7	Their children whom He raised up in their place, Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them along the way.
JOS.5.8	Now when they had finished circumcising all the nation, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed. 
JOS.5.9	Then the L
JOS.5.10	While the sons of Israel camped at Gilgal they observed the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month on the desert plains of Jericho. 
JOS.5.11	On the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched 
JOS.5.12	The manna ceased on the day after they had eaten some of the produce of the land, so that the sons of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate some of the yield of the land of Canaan during that year.
JOS.5.13	Now it came about when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand, and Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us or for our adversaries?” 
JOS.5.14	He said, “No; rather I indeed come now 
JOS.5.15	The captain of the L
JOS.6.1	Now Jericho was tightly shut because of the sons of Israel; no one went out and no one came in. 
JOS.6.2	The L
JOS.6.3	You shall march around the city, all the men of war circling the city once. You shall do so for six days. 
JOS.6.4	Also seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark; then on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. 
JOS.6.5	It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people will go up every man straight ahead.”
JOS.6.6	So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the L
JOS.6.7	Then he said to the people, “Go forward, and march around the city, and let the armed men go on before the ark of the L
JOS.6.8	And it was 
JOS.6.9	The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they continued to blow the trumpets. 
JOS.6.10	But Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout nor let your voice be heard nor let a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall shout!” 
JOS.6.11	So he had the ark of the L
JOS.6.12	Now Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the L
JOS.6.13	The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the L
JOS.6.14	Thus the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp; they did so for six days.
JOS.6.15	Then on the seventh day they rose early at the dawning of the day and marched around the city in the same manner seven times; only on that day they marched around the city seven times. 
JOS.6.16	At the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout! For the L
JOS.6.17	The city shall be under the ban, it and all that is in it belongs to the L
JOS.6.18	But as for you, only keep yourselves from the things under the ban, so that you do not covet 
JOS.6.19	But all the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron are holy to the L
JOS.6.20	So the people shouted, and 
JOS.6.21	They utterly destroyed everything in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.
JOS.6.22	Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the harlot’s house and bring the woman and all she has out of there, as you have sworn to her.” 
JOS.6.23	So the young men who were spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brothers and all she had; they also brought out all her relatives and placed them outside the camp of Israel. 
JOS.6.24	They burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver and gold, and articles of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the 
JOS.6.25	However, Rahab the harlot and her father’s household and all she had, Joshua spared; and she has lived in the midst of Israel to this day, for she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
JOS.6.26	Then Joshua made them take an oath at that time, saying, “Cursed before the L
JOS.6.27	So the L
JOS.7.1	But the sons of Israel acted unfaithfully in regard to the things under the ban, for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took some of the things under the ban, therefore the anger of the L
JOS.7.2	Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai. 
JOS.7.3	They returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not let all the people go up; 
JOS.7.4	So about three thousand men from the people went up there, but they fled from the men of Ai. 
JOS.7.5	The men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of their men, and pursued them from the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them down on the descent, so the hearts of the people melted and became as water.
JOS.7.6	Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the L
JOS.7.7	Joshua said, “Alas, O Lord G
JOS.7.8	O Lord, what can I say since Israel has turned 
JOS.7.9	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will You do for Your great name?”
JOS.7.10	So the L
JOS.7.11	Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. And they have even taken some of the things under the ban and have both stolen and deceived. Moreover, they have also put 
JOS.7.12	Therefore the sons of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn 
JOS.7.13	Rise up! Consecrate the people and say, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for thus the L
JOS.7.14	In the morning then you shall come near by your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which the L
JOS.7.15	It shall be that the one who is taken with the things under the ban shall be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of the L
JOS.7.16	So Joshua arose early in the morning and brought Israel near by tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken. 
JOS.7.17	He brought the family of Judah near, and he took the family of the Zerahites; and he brought the family of the Zerahites near man by man, and Zabdi was taken. 
JOS.7.18	He brought his household near man by man; and Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was taken. 
JOS.7.19	Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, I implore you, give glory to the L
JOS.7.20	So Achan answered Joshua and said, “Truly, I have sinned against the L
JOS.7.21	when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold fifty shekels in weight, then I coveted them and took them; and behold, they are concealed in the earth inside my tent with the silver underneath it.”
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was concealed in his tent with the silver underneath it. 
JOS.7.23	They took them from inside the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the sons of Israel, and they poured them out before the L
JOS.7.24	Then Joshua and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the mantle, the bar of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent and all that belonged to him; and they brought them up to the valley of 
JOS.7.25	Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? The L
JOS.7.26	They raised over him a great heap of stones that stands to this day, and the L
JOS.8.1	Now the L
JOS.8.2	You shall do to Ai and its king just as you did to Jericho and its king; you shall take only its spoil and its cattle as plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it.”
JOS.8.3	So Joshua rose with all the people of war to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose 30,000 men, valiant warriors, and sent them out at night. 
JOS.8.4	He commanded them, saying, “See, you are going to ambush the city from behind it. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready. 
JOS.8.5	Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they come out to meet us as at the first, we will flee before them. 
JOS.8.6	They will come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, ‘
JOS.8.7	And you shall rise from 
JOS.8.8	Then it will be when you have seized the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do 
JOS.8.9	So Joshua sent them away, and they went to the place of ambush and remained between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua spent that night among the people.
JOS.8.10	Now Joshua rose early in the morning and mustered the people, and he went up with the elders of Israel before the people to Ai. 
JOS.8.11	Then all the people of war who 
JOS.8.12	And he took about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. 
JOS.8.13	So they stationed the people, all the army that was on the north side of the city, and its rear guard on the west side of the city, and Joshua spent that night in the midst of the valley. 
JOS.8.14	It came about when the king of Ai saw 
JOS.8.15	Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. 
JOS.8.16	And all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city. 
JOS.8.17	So not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel, and they left the city unguarded and pursued Israel.
JOS.8.18	Then the L
JOS.8.19	The 
JOS.8.20	When the men of Ai turned back and looked, behold, the smoke of the city ascended to the sky, and they had no place to flee this way or that, for the people who had been fleeing to the wilderness turned against the pursuers. 
JOS.8.21	When Joshua and all Israel saw that the 
JOS.8.22	The others came out from the city to encounter them, so that they were 
JOS.8.23	But they took alive the king of Ai and brought him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	Now when Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them were fallen by the edge of the sword until they were destroyed, then all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword. 
JOS.8.25	All who fell that day, both men and women, were 12,000—all the people of Ai. 
JOS.8.26	For Joshua did not withdraw his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 
JOS.8.27	Israel took only the cattle and the spoil of that city as plunder for themselves, according to the word of the L
JOS.8.28	So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever, a desolation until this day. 
JOS.8.29	He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; and at sunset Joshua gave command and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the city gate, and raised over it a great heap of stones 
JOS.8.30	Then Joshua built an altar to the L
JOS.8.31	just as Moses the servant of the L
JOS.8.32	He wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written, in the presence of the sons of Israel. 
JOS.8.33	All Israel with their elders and officers and their judges were standing on both sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the L
JOS.8.34	Then afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law. 
JOS.8.35	There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers who were living among them.
JOS.9.1	Now it came about when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country and in the lowland and on all the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, heard of it, 
JOS.9.2	that they gathered themselves together with one accord to fight with Joshua and with Israel.
JOS.9.3	When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai, 
JOS.9.4	they also acted craftily and set out as envoys, and took worn-out sacks on their donkeys, and wineskins worn-out and torn and mended, 
JOS.9.5	and worn-out and patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry 
JOS.9.6	They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country; now therefore, make a covenant with us.” 
JOS.9.7	The men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you are living within our land; how then shall we make a covenant with you?” 
JOS.9.8	But they said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” Then Joshua said to them, “Who are you and where do you come from?” 
JOS.9.9	They said to him, “Your servants have come from a very far country because of the fame of the L
JOS.9.10	and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan who was at Ashtaroth. 
JOS.9.11	So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take provisions in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them and say to them, “We are your servants; now then, make a covenant with us.” ’ 
JOS.9.12	This our bread 
JOS.9.13	These wineskins which we filled were new, and behold, they are torn; and these our clothes and our sandals are worn out because of the very long journey.” 
JOS.9.14	So the men 
JOS.9.15	Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them, to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation swore 
JOS.9.16	It came about at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were neighbors and that they were living within their land. 
JOS.9.17	Then the sons of Israel set out and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities 
JOS.9.18	The sons of Israel did not strike them because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the L
JOS.9.19	But all the leaders said to the whole congregation, “We have sworn to them by the L
JOS.9.20	This we will do to them, even let them live, so that wrath will not be upon us for the oath which we swore to them.” 
JOS.9.21	The leaders said to them, “Let them live.” So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the whole congregation, just as the leaders had spoken to them.
JOS.9.22	Then Joshua called for them and spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ when you are living within our land? 
JOS.9.23	Now therefore, you are cursed, and you shall never cease being slaves, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.” 
JOS.9.24	So they answered Joshua and said, “Because it was certainly told your servants that the L
JOS.9.25	Now behold, we are in your hands; do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us.” 
JOS.9.26	Thus he did to them, and delivered them from the hands of the sons of Israel, and they did not kill them. 
JOS.9.27	But Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the L
JOS.10.1	Now it came about when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai, and had utterly destroyed it (just as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king), and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were within their land, 
JOS.10.2	that he feared greatly, because Gibeon 
JOS.10.3	Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent 
JOS.10.4	“Come up to me and help me, and let us attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel.” 
JOS.10.5	So the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, 
JOS.10.6	Then the men of Gibeon sent 
JOS.10.7	So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him and all the valiant warriors. 
JOS.10.8	The L
JOS.10.9	So Joshua came upon them suddenly by marching all night from Gilgal. 
JOS.10.10	And the L
JOS.10.11	As they fled from before Israel, 
JOS.10.12	Then Joshua spoke to the L
JOS.10.12	“O sun, stand still at Gibeon,
JOS.10.12	And O moon in the valley of Aijalon.”
JOS.10.13	So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped,
JOS.10.13	Until the nation avenged themselves of their enemies.
JOS.10.13	Is it not written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and did not hasten to go 
JOS.10.14	There was no day like that before it or after it, when the L
JOS.10.15	Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp to Gilgal.
JOS.10.16	Now these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in the cave at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	It was told Joshua, saying, “The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.” 
JOS.10.18	Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and assign men by it to guard them, 
JOS.10.19	but do not stay 
JOS.10.20	It came about when Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished slaying them with a very great slaughter, until they were destroyed, and the survivors 
JOS.10.21	that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. No one uttered a word against any of the sons of Israel.
JOS.10.22	Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring these five kings out to me from the cave.” 
JOS.10.23	They did so, and brought these five kings out to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, 
JOS.10.24	When they brought these kings out to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came near and put their feet on their necks. 
JOS.10.25	Joshua then said to them, “Do not fear or be dismayed! Be strong and courageous, for thus the L
JOS.10.26	So afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hanged them on five trees; and they hung on the trees until evening. 
JOS.10.27	It came about at sunset that Joshua gave a command, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and put large stones over the mouth of the cave, to this very day.
JOS.10.28	Now Joshua captured Makkedah on that day, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword; he utterly destroyed it and every 
JOS.10.29	Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah, and fought against Libnah. 
JOS.10.30	The L
JOS.10.31	And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish, and they camped by it and fought against it. 
JOS.10.32	The L
JOS.10.33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish, and Joshua defeated him and his people until he had left him no survivor.
JOS.10.34	And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon, and they camped by it and fought against it. 
JOS.10.35	They captured it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; and he utterly destroyed that day every person who 
JOS.10.36	Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought against it. 
JOS.10.37	They captured it and struck it and its king and all its cities and all the persons who 
JOS.10.38	Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to Debir, and they fought against it. 
JOS.10.39	He captured it and its king and all its cities, and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed every person 
JOS.10.40	Thus Joshua struck all the land, the hill country and the 
JOS.10.41	Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea even as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen even as far as Gibeon. 
JOS.10.42	Joshua captured all these kings and their lands at one time, because the L
JOS.10.43	So Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
JOS.11.1	Then it came about, when Jabin king of Hazor heard 
JOS.11.2	and to the kings who were of the north in the hill country, and in the Arabah—south of 
JOS.11.3	to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpeh. 
JOS.11.4	They came out, they and all their armies with them, 
JOS.11.5	So all of these kings having agreed to meet, came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
JOS.11.6	Then the L
JOS.11.7	So Joshua and all the people of war with him came upon them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and attacked them. 
JOS.11.8	The L
JOS.11.9	Joshua did to them as the L
JOS.11.10	Then Joshua turned back at that time, and captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor formerly was the head of all these kingdoms. 
JOS.11.11	They struck every person who was in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying 
JOS.11.12	Joshua captured all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, 
JOS.11.13	However, Israel did not burn any cities that stood on their mounds, except Hazor alone, 
JOS.11.14	All the spoil of these cities and the cattle, the sons of Israel took as their plunder; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They left no one who breathed. 
JOS.11.15	Just as the L
JOS.11.16	Thus Joshua took all that land: the hill country and all the Negev, all that land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel and its lowland 
JOS.11.17	from Mount Halak, that rises toward Seir, even as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them down and put them to death. 
JOS.11.18	Joshua waged war a long time with all these kings. 
JOS.11.19	There was not a city which made peace with the sons of Israel except the Hivites living in Gibeon; they took them all in battle. 
JOS.11.20	For it was of the L
JOS.11.21	Then Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab and from all the hill country of Judah and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities. 
JOS.11.22	There were no Anakim left in the land of the sons of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod some remained. 
JOS.11.23	So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the L
JOS.12.1	Now these are the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel defeated, and whose land they possessed beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon as far as Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah to the east: 
JOS.12.2	Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, 
JOS.12.3	and the Arabah as far as the Sea of 
JOS.12.4	and the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 
JOS.12.5	and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half of Gilead, 
JOS.12.6	Moses the servant of the L
JOS.12.7	Now these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel defeated beyond the Jordan toward the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even as far as Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir; and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their divisions, 
JOS.12.8	in the hill country, in the lowland, in the Arabah, on the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the Negev; the Hittite, the Amorite and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite: 
JOS.12.9	the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one; 
JOS.12.10	the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 
JOS.12.11	the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 
JOS.12.12	the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 
JOS.12.13	the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 
JOS.12.14	the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; 
JOS.12.15	the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 
JOS.12.16	the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; 
JOS.12.17	the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 
JOS.12.18	the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one; 
JOS.12.19	the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; 
JOS.12.20	the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one; 
JOS.12.21	the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 
JOS.12.22	the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one; 
JOS.12.23	the king of Dor in the heights of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one; 
JOS.12.24	the king of Tirzah, one: in all, thirty-one kings.
JOS.13.1	Now Joshua was old 
JOS.13.2	This is the land that remains: all the regions 
JOS.13.3	from the Shihor which is east of Egypt, even as far as the border of Ekron to the north (it is counted as Canaanite); the five lords of the Philistines: the Gazite, the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, the Ekronite; and the Avvite 
JOS.13.4	to the south, all the land of the Canaanite, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorite; 
JOS.13.5	and the land of the Gebalite, and all of Lebanon, toward the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon as far as Lebo-hamath. 
JOS.13.6	All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon as far as Misrephoth-maim, all the Sidonians, I will drive them out from before the sons of Israel; only allot it to Israel for an inheritance as I have commanded you. 
JOS.13.7	Now therefore, apportion this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”
JOS.13.8	With the other half-tribe, the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan to the east, just as Moses the servant of the L
JOS.13.9	from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba, as far as Dibon; 
JOS.13.10	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the sons of Ammon; 
JOS.13.11	and Gilead, and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah; 
JOS.13.12	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for Moses struck them and dispossessed them. 
JOS.13.13	But the sons of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites or the Maacathites; for Geshur and Maacath live among Israel until this day. 
JOS.13.14	Only to the tribe of Levi he did not give an inheritance; the offerings by fire to the L
JOS.13.15	So Moses gave 
JOS.13.16	Their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by Medeba; 
JOS.13.17	Heshbon, and all its cities which are on the plain: Dibon and Bamoth-baal and Beth-baal-meon, 
JOS.13.18	and Jahaz and Kedemoth and Mephaath, 
JOS.13.19	and Kiriathaim and Sibmah and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley, 
JOS.13.20	and Beth-peor and the slopes of Pisgah and Beth-jeshimoth, 
JOS.13.21	even all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land. 
JOS.13.22	The sons of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner, with the sword among 
JOS.13.23	The border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, the cities and their villages.
JOS.13.24	Moses also gave 
JOS.13.25	Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, as far as Aroer which is before Rabbah; 
JOS.13.26	and from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim as far as the border of Debir; 
JOS.13.27	and in the valley, Beth-haram and Beth-nimrah and Succoth and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as a border, as far as the 
JOS.13.28	This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, the cities and their villages.
JOS.13.29	Moses also gave 
JOS.13.30	Their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities; 
JOS.13.31	also half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, 
JOS.13.32	These are 
JOS.13.33	But to the tribe of Levi, Moses did not give an inheritance; the L
JOS.14.1	Now these are 
JOS.14.2	by the lot of their inheritance, as the L
JOS.14.3	For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but he did not give an inheritance to the Levites among them. 
JOS.14.4	For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and they did not give a portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to live in, with their pasture lands for their livestock and for their property. 
JOS.14.5	Thus the sons of Israel did just as the L
JOS.14.6	Then the sons of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know the word which the L
JOS.14.7	I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the L
JOS.14.8	Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt with fear; but I followed the L
JOS.14.9	So Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land on which your foot has trodden will be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have followed the L
JOS.14.10	Now behold, the L
JOS.14.11	I am still as strong today as I was in the day Moses sent me; as my strength was then, so my strength is now, for war and for going out and coming in. 
JOS.14.12	Now then, give me this hill country about which the L
JOS.14.13	So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance. 
JOS.14.14	Therefore, Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite until this day, because he followed the L
JOS.14.15	Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba; 
JOS.15.1	Now the lot for the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families reached the border of Edom, southward to the wilderness of Zin at the extreme south. 
JOS.15.2	Their south border was from the lower end of the Salt Sea, from the bay that turns to the south. 
JOS.15.3	Then it proceeded southward to the ascent of Akrabbim and continued to Zin, then went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea and continued to Hezron, and went up to Addar and turned about to Karka. 
JOS.15.4	It continued to Azmon and proceeded to the brook of Egypt, and the border ended at the sea. This shall be your south border. 
JOS.15.5	The east border 
JOS.15.6	Then the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and continued on the north of Beth-arabah, and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 
JOS.15.7	The border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and turned northward toward Gilgal which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south of the valley; and the border continued to the waters of En-shemesh and it ended at En-rogel. 
JOS.15.8	Then the border went up the valley of Ben-hinnom to the slope of the Jebusite on the south (that is, Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain which is before the valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the end of the valley of Rephaim toward the north. 
JOS.15.9	From the top of the mountain the border curved to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and proceeded to the cities of Mount Ephron, then the border curved to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim). 
JOS.15.10	The border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir, and continued to the slope of Mount Jearim on the north (that is, Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh and continued through Timnah. 
JOS.15.11	The border proceeded to the side of Ekron northward. Then the border curved to Shikkeron and continued to Mount Baalah and proceeded to Jabneel, and the border ended at the sea. 
JOS.15.12	The west border 
JOS.15.13	Now he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the sons of Judah, according to the command of the L
JOS.15.14	Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the children of Anak. 
JOS.15.15	Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir; now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher. 
JOS.15.16	And Caleb said, “The one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter as a wife.” 
JOS.15.17	Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it; so he gave him Achsah his daughter as a wife. 
JOS.15.18	It came about that when she came 
JOS.15.19	Then she said, “Give me a blessing; since you have given me the land of the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
JOS.15.20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families.
JOS.15.21	Now the cities at the extremity of the tribe of the sons of Judah toward the border of Edom in the south were Kabzeel and Eder and Jagur, 
JOS.15.22	and Kinah and Dimonah and Adadah, 
JOS.15.23	and Kedesh and Hazor and Ithnan, 
JOS.15.24	Ziph and Telem and Bealoth, 
JOS.15.25	and Hazor-hadattah and Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor), 
JOS.15.26	Amam and Shema and Moladah, 
JOS.15.27	and Hazar-gaddah and Heshmon and Beth-pelet, 
JOS.15.28	and Hazar-shual and Beersheba and Biziothiah, 
JOS.15.29	Baalah and Iim and Ezem, 
JOS.15.30	and Eltolad and Chesil and Hormah, 
JOS.15.31	and Ziklag and Madmannah and Sansannah, 
JOS.15.32	and Lebaoth and Shilhim and Ain and Rimmon; in all, twenty-nine cities with their villages.
JOS.15.33	In the lowland: Eshtaol and Zorah and Ashnah, 
JOS.15.34	and Zanoah and En-gannim, Tappuah and Enam, 
JOS.15.35	Jarmuth and Adullam, Socoh and Azekah, 
JOS.15.36	and Shaaraim and Adithaim and Gederah and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages.
JOS.15.37	Zenan and Hadashah and Migdal-gad, 
JOS.15.38	and Dilean and Mizpeh and Joktheel, 
JOS.15.39	Lachish and Bozkath and Eglon, 
JOS.15.40	and Cabbon and Lahmas and Chitlish, 
JOS.15.41	and Gederoth, Beth-dagon and Naamah and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages.
JOS.15.42	Libnah and Ether and Ashan, 
JOS.15.43	and Iphtah and Ashnah and Nezib, 
JOS.15.44	and Keilah and Achzib and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages.
JOS.15.45	Ekron, with its towns and its villages; 
JOS.15.46	from Ekron even to the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod, with their villages.
JOS.15.47	Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; as far as the brook of Egypt and the Great Sea, even 
JOS.15.48	In the hill country: Shamir and Jattir and Socoh, 
JOS.15.49	and Dannah and Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir), 
JOS.15.50	and Anab and Eshtemoh and Anim, 
JOS.15.51	and Goshen and Holon and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.
JOS.15.52	Arab and Dumah and Eshan, 
JOS.15.53	and Janum and Beth-tappuah and Aphekah, 
JOS.15.54	and Humtah and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior; nine cities with their villages.
JOS.15.55	Maon, Carmel and Ziph and Juttah, 
JOS.15.56	and Jezreel and Jokdeam and Zanoah, 
JOS.15.57	Kain, Gibeah and Timnah; ten cities with their villages.
JOS.15.58	Halhul, Beth-zur and Gedor, 
JOS.15.59	and Maarath and Beth-anoth and Eltekon; six cities with their villages.
JOS.15.60	Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.
JOS.15.61	In the wilderness: Beth-arabah, Middin and Secacah, 
JOS.15.62	and Nibshan and the City of Salt and Engedi; six cities with their villages.
JOS.15.63	Now as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the sons of Judah could not drive them out; so the Jebusites live with the sons of Judah at Jerusalem until this day.
JOS.16.1	Then the lot for the sons of Joseph went from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east into the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel. 
JOS.16.2	It went from Bethel to Luz, and continued to the border of the Archites at Ataroth. 
JOS.16.3	It went down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the territory of lower Beth-horon even to Gezer, and it ended at the sea.
JOS.16.4	The sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance. 
JOS.16.5	Now 
JOS.16.6	Then the border went westward at Michmethath on the north, and the border turned about eastward to Taanath-shiloh and continued 
JOS.16.7	It went down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, then reached Jericho and came out at the Jordan. 
JOS.16.8	From Tappuah the border continued westward to the brook of Kanah, and it ended at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim according to their families, 
JOS.16.9	 with the cities which were set apart for the sons of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. 
JOS.16.10	But they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites live in the midst of Ephraim to this day, and they became forced laborers.
JOS.17.1	Now 
JOS.17.2	So 
JOS.17.3	However, Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. 
JOS.17.4	They came near before Eleazar the priest and before Joshua the son of Nun and before the leaders, saying, “The L
JOS.17.5	Thus there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan, 
JOS.17.6	because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
JOS.17.7	The border of Manasseh ran from Asher to Michmethath which was east of Shechem; then the border went southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah. 
JOS.17.8	The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh 
JOS.17.9	The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook (these cities 
JOS.17.10	The south side 
JOS.17.11	In Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its towns and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, the third is Napheth. 
JOS.17.12	But the sons of Manasseh could not take possession of these cities, because the Canaanites persisted in living in that land. 
JOS.17.13	It came about when the sons of Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.
JOS.17.14	Then the sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given me only one lot and one portion for an inheritance, since I am a numerous people whom the L
JOS.17.15	Joshua said to them, “If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.” 
JOS.17.16	The sons of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the valley land have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth-shean and its towns and those who are in the valley of Jezreel.” 
JOS.17.17	Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, saying, “You are a numerous people and have great power; you shall not have one lot 
JOS.17.18	but the hill country shall be yours. For though it is a forest, you shall clear it, and to its farthest borders it shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, even though they have chariots of iron 
JOS.18.1	Then the whole congregation of the sons of Israel assembled themselves at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there; and the land was subdued before them.
JOS.18.2	There remained among the sons of Israel seven tribes who had not divided their inheritance. 
JOS.18.3	So Joshua said to the sons of Israel, “How long will you put off entering to take possession of the land which the L
JOS.18.4	Provide for yourselves three men from each tribe that I may send them, and that they may arise and walk through the land and write a description of it according to their inheritance; then they shall return to me. 
JOS.18.5	They shall divide it into seven portions; Judah shall stay in its territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall stay in their territory on the north. 
JOS.18.6	You shall describe the land in seven divisions, and bring

JOS.18.9	So the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities in seven divisions in a book; and they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh. 
JOS.18.10	And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the L
JOS.18.11	Now the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot lay between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph. 
JOS.18.12	Their border on the north side was from the Jordan, then the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward, and 
JOS.18.13	From there the border continued to Luz, to the side of Luz (that is, Bethel) southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-addar, near the hill which 
JOS.18.14	The border extended 
JOS.18.15	Then the south side 
JOS.18.16	The border went down to the edge of the hill which is in the valley of Ben-hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the slope of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel. 
JOS.18.17	It extended northward and went to En-shemesh and went to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 
JOS.18.18	It continued to the side in front of the Arabah northward and went down to the Arabah. 
JOS.18.19	The border continued to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the 
JOS.18.20	Moreover, the Jordan was its border on the east side. This 
JOS.18.21	Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho and Beth-hoglah and Emek-keziz, 
JOS.18.22	and Beth-arabah and Zemaraim and Bethel, 
JOS.18.23	and Avvim and Parah and Ophrah,

JOS.18.28	and Zelah, Haeleph and the Jebusite (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families.
JOS.19.1	Then the second lot fell to Simeon, to the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families, and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Judah. 
JOS.19.2	So they had as their inheritance Beersheba or Sheba and Moladah, 
JOS.19.3	and Hazar-shual and Balah and Ezem,

JOS.19.10	Now the third lot came up for the sons of Zebulun according to their families. And the territory of their inheritance was as far as Sarid. 
JOS.19.11	Then their border went up to the west and to Maralah, it then touched Dabbesheth and reached to the brook that is before Jokneam. 
JOS.19.12	Then it turned from Sarid to the east toward the sunrise as far as the border of Chisloth-tabor, and it proceeded to Daberath and up to Japhia. 
JOS.19.13	From there it continued eastward toward the sunrise to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and it proceeded to Rimmon which stretches to Neah. 
JOS.19.14	The border circled around it on the north to Hannathon, and it ended at the valley of Iphtahel. 
JOS.19.15	 also 
JOS.19.16	This 
JOS.19.17	The fourth lot fell to Issachar, to the sons of Issachar according to their families. 
JOS.19.18	Their territory was to Jezreel and

JOS.19.22	The border reached to Tabor and Shahazumah and Beth-shemesh, and their border ended at the Jordan; sixteen cities with their villages.

JOS.19.25	Their territory was Helkath and Hali and Beten and Achshaph, 
JOS.19.26	and Allammelech and Amad and Mishal; and it reached to Carmel on the west and to Shihor-libnath. 
JOS.19.27	It turned toward the east to Beth-dagon and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtahel northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; then it proceeded on north to Cabul, 
JOS.19.28	and Ebron and Rehob and Hammon and Kanah, as far as Great Sidon. 
JOS.19.29	The border turned to Ramah and to the fortified city of Tyre; then the border turned to Hosah, and it ended at the sea by the region of Achzib. 
JOS.19.30	 also 
JOS.19.31	This 
JOS.19.32	The sixth lot fell to the sons of Naphtali; to the sons of Naphtali according to their families. 
JOS.19.33	Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim and Adami-nekeb and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and it ended at the Jordan. 
JOS.19.34	Then the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor and proceeded from there to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south and touched Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the east. 
JOS.19.35	The fortified cities 
JOS.19.36	and Adamah and Ramah and Hazor, 
JOS.19.37	and Kedesh and Edrei and En-hazor, 
JOS.19.38	and Yiron and Migdal-el, Horem and Beth-anath and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages. 
JOS.19.39	This 
JOS.19.40	The seventh lot fell to the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families. 
JOS.19.41	The territory of their inheritance was Zorah and Eshtaol and Ir-shemesh, 
JOS.19.42	and Shaalabbin and Aijalon and Ithlah,

JOS.19.45	and Jehud and Bene-berak and Gath-rimmon, 
JOS.19.46	and Me-jarkon and Rakkon, with the territory over against Joppa. 
JOS.19.47	The territory of the sons of Dan proceeded beyond them; for the sons of Dan went up and fought with Leshem and captured it. Then they struck it with the edge of the sword and possessed it and settled in it; and they called Leshem Dan after the name of Dan their father. 
JOS.19.48	This 
JOS.19.49	When they finished apportioning the land for inheritance by its borders, the sons of Israel gave an inheritance in their midst to Joshua the son of Nun. 
JOS.19.50	In accordance with the command of the L
JOS.19.51	These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel distributed by lot in Shiloh before the L
JOS.20.1	Then the L
JOS.20.2	“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘Designate the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses, 
JOS.20.3	that the manslayer who kills any person unintentionally, without premeditation, may flee there, and they shall become your refuge from the avenger of blood. 
JOS.20.4	He shall flee to one of these cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and state his case in the hearing of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city to them and give him a place, so that he may dwell among them. 
JOS.20.5	Now if the avenger of blood pursues him, then they shall not deliver the manslayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbor without premeditation and did not hate him beforehand. 
JOS.20.6	He shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the one who is high priest in those days. Then the manslayer shall return to his own city and to his own house, to the city from which he fled.’ ”
JOS.20.7	So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 
JOS.20.8	Beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plain from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh. 
JOS.20.9	These were the appointed cities for all the sons of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them, that whoever kills any person unintentionally may flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stands before the congregation.
JOS.21.1	Then the heads of households of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of households of the tribes of the sons of Israel. 
JOS.21.2	They spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, “The L
JOS.21.3	So the sons of Israel gave the Levites from their inheritance these cities with their pasture lands, according to the command of the L
JOS.21.4	Then the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. And the sons of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, received thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah and from the tribe of the Simeonites and from the tribe of Benjamin.
JOS.21.5	The rest of the sons of Kohath received ten cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim and from the tribe of Dan and from the half-tribe of Manasseh.
JOS.21.6	The sons of Gershon received thirteen cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar and from the tribe of Asher and from the tribe of Naphtali and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
JOS.21.7	The sons of Merari according to their families received twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben and from the tribe of Gad and from the tribe of Zebulun.
JOS.21.8	Now the sons of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their pasture lands, as the L
JOS.21.9	They gave these cities which are 
JOS.21.10	and they were for the sons of Aaron, one of the families of the Kohathites, of the sons of Levi, for the lot was theirs first. 
JOS.21.11	Thus they gave them Kiriath-arba, 
JOS.21.12	But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.
JOS.21.13	So to the sons of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, and Libnah with its pasture lands, 
JOS.21.14	and Jattir with its pasture lands and Eshtemoa with its pasture lands, 
JOS.21.15	and Holon with its pasture lands and Debir with its pasture lands, 
JOS.21.16	and Ain with its pasture lands and Juttah with its pasture lands 
JOS.21.17	From the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its pasture lands, Geba with its pasture lands, 
JOS.21.18	Anathoth with its pasture lands and Almon with its pasture lands; four cities. 
JOS.21.19	All the cities of the sons of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
JOS.21.20	Then the cities from the tribe of Ephraim were allotted to the families of the sons of Kohath, the Levites, 
JOS.21.21	They gave them Shechem, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, in the hill country of Ephraim, and Gezer with its pasture lands, 
JOS.21.22	and Kibzaim with its pasture lands and Beth-horon with its pasture lands; four cities. 
JOS.21.23	From the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its pasture lands, Gibbethon with its pasture lands, 
JOS.21.24	Aijalon with its pasture lands, Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands; four cities. 
JOS.21.25	From the half-tribe of Manasseh, 
JOS.21.26	All the cities with their pasture lands for the families of the rest of the sons of Kohath were ten.
JOS.21.27	To the sons of Gershon, one of the families of the Levites, from the half-tribe of Manasseh, 
JOS.21.28	From the tribe of Issachar, 
JOS.21.29	Jarmuth with its pasture lands, En-gannim with its pasture lands; four cities. 
JOS.21.30	From the tribe of Asher, 
JOS.21.31	Helkath with its pasture lands and Rehob with its pasture lands; four cities. 
JOS.21.32	From the tribe of Naphtali, 
JOS.21.33	All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
JOS.21.34	To the families of the sons of Merari, the rest of the Levites, 
JOS.21.35	Dimnah with its pasture lands, Nahalal with its pasture lands; four cities. 
JOS.21.36	From the tribe of Reuben, 
JOS.21.37	Kedemoth with its pasture lands and Mephaath with its pasture lands; four cities. 
JOS.21.38	From the tribe of Gad, 
JOS.21.39	Heshbon with its pasture lands, Jazer with its pasture lands; four cities in all. 
JOS.21.40	All 
JOS.21.41	All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the sons of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.42	These cities each had its surrounding pasture lands; thus 
JOS.21.43	So the L
JOS.21.44	And the L
JOS.21.45	Not one of the good promises which the L
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, 
JOS.22.2	and said to them, “You have kept all that Moses the servant of the L
JOS.22.3	You have not forsaken your brothers these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the L
JOS.22.4	And now the L
JOS.22.5	Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the L
JOS.22.6	So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.
JOS.22.7	Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given 
JOS.22.8	and said to them, “Return to your tents with great riches and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron, and with very many clothes; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.” 
JOS.22.9	The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned 
JOS.22.10	When they came to the region of the Jordan which is in the land of Canaan, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, a large altar in appearance. 
JOS.22.11	And the sons of Israel heard 
JOS.22.12	When the sons of Israel heard 
JOS.22.13	Then the sons of Israel sent to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, 
JOS.22.14	and with him ten chiefs, one chief for each father’s household from each of the tribes of Israel; and each one of them 
JOS.22.15	They came to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them saying, 
JOS.22.16	“Thus says the whole congregation of the L
JOS.22.17	Is not the iniquity of Peor enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although a plague came on the congregation of the L
JOS.22.18	that you must turn away this day from following the L
JOS.22.19	If, however, the land of your possession is unclean, then cross into the land of the possession of the L
JOS.22.20	Did not Achan the son of Zerah act unfaithfully in the things under the ban, and wrath fall on all the congregation of Israel? And that man did not perish alone in his iniquity.’ ”
JOS.22.21	Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered and spoke to the heads of the families of Israel. 
JOS.22.22	“The Mighty One, God, the L
JOS.22.23	If we have built us an altar to turn away from following the L
JOS.22.24	But truly we have done this out of concern, for a reason, saying, ‘In time to come your sons may say to our sons, “What have you to do with the L
JOS.22.25	For the L
JOS.22.26	“Therefore we said, ‘Let us build an altar, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice; 
JOS.22.27	rather it shall be a witness between us and you and between our generations after us, that we are to perform the service of the L
JOS.22.28	Therefore we said, ‘It shall also come about if they say 
JOS.22.29	Far be it from us that we should rebel against the L
JOS.22.30	So when Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation, even the heads of the families of Israel who

JOS.22.32	Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the leaders returned from the sons of Reuben and from the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and brought back word to them. 
JOS.22.33	The word pleased the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel blessed God; and they did not speak of going up against them in war to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad were living. 
JOS.22.34	The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar 
JOS.23.1	Now it came about after many days, when the L
JOS.23.2	that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and their heads and their judges and their officers, and said to them, “I am old, advanced in years. 
JOS.23.3	And you have seen all that the L

JOS.23.5	The L
JOS.23.6	Be very firm, then, to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, so that you may not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left, 
JOS.23.7	so that you will not associate with these nations, these which remain among you, or mention the name of their gods, or make

JOS.23.13	know with certainty that the L

JOS.23.16	When you transgress the covenant of the L
JOS.24.1	Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel and for their heads and their judges and their officers; and they presented themselves before God. 
JOS.24.2	Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says the L
JOS.24.3	Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him through all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his descendants and gave him Isaac. 
JOS.24.4	To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau, and to Esau I gave Mount Seir to possess it; but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt. 
JOS.24.5	Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt by what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought you out. 
JOS.24.6	I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and Egypt pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. 
JOS.24.7	But when they cried out to the L
JOS.24.8	Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan, and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land when I destroyed them before you. 
JOS.24.9	Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel, and he sent and summoned Balaam the son of Beor to curse you. 
JOS.24.10	But I was not willing to listen to Balaam. So he had to bless you, and I delivered you from his hand. 
JOS.24.11	You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho; and the citizens of Jericho fought against you, 
JOS.24.12	Then I sent the hornet before you and it drove out the two kings of the Amorites from before you, 
JOS.24.13	I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and cities which you had not built, and you have lived in them; you are eating of vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.’
JOS.24.14	“Now, therefore, fear the L
JOS.24.15	If it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the L
JOS.24.16	The people answered and said, “Far be it from us that we should forsake the L
JOS.24.17	for the L

JOS.24.19	Then Joshua said to the people, “You will not be able to serve the L
JOS.24.20	If you forsake the L
JOS.24.21	The people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve the L
JOS.24.22	Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves the L
JOS.24.23	“Now therefore, put away the foreign gods which are in your midst, and incline your hearts to the L
JOS.24.24	The people said to Joshua, “We will serve the L
JOS.24.25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. 
JOS.24.26	And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the L
JOS.24.27	Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone shall be for a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the L
JOS.24.28	Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to his inheritance.
JOS.24.29	It came about after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the L
JOS.24.30	And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of Mount Gaash.
JOS.24.31	Israel served the L
JOS.24.32	Now they buried the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up from Egypt, at Shechem, in the piece of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of money; and they became the inheritance of Joseph’s sons. 
JOS.24.33	And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him at Gibeah of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim.
JDG.1.1	Now it came about after the death of Joshua that the sons of Israel inquired of the L

JDG.1.3	Then Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into the territory allotted me, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I in turn will go with you into the territory allotted you.” So Simeon went with him. 
JDG.1.4	Judah went up, and the L
JDG.1.5	They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek and fought against him, and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 
JDG.1.6	But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes. 
JDG.1.7	Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to gather up 
JDG.1.8	Then the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire. 
JDG.1.9	Afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country and in the

JDG.1.13	Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah for a wife. 
JDG.1.14	Then it came about when she came 
JDG.1.15	She said to him, “Give me a blessing, since you have given me the land of the 
JDG.1.16	The descendants of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up from the city of palms with the sons of Judah, to the wilderness of Judah which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people. 
JDG.1.17	Then Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites living in Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah. 
JDG.1.18	And Judah took Gaza with its territory and Ashkelon with its territory and Ekron with its territory. 
JDG.1.19	Now the L
JDG.1.20	Then they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had promised; and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak. 
JDG.1.21	But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
JDG.1.22	Likewise the house of Joseph went up against Bethel, and the L
JDG.1.23	The house of Joseph spied out Bethel (now the name of the city was formerly Luz). 
JDG.1.24	The spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance to the city and we will treat you kindly.” 
JDG.1.25	So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go free. 
JDG.1.26	The man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and named it Luz which is its name to this day.
JDG.1.27	But Manasseh did not take possession of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; so the Canaanites persisted in living in that land. 
JDG.1.28	It came about when Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.
JDG.1.29	Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who were living in Gezer; so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
JDG.1.30	Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of 
JDG.1.31	Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob. 
JDG.1.32	So the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.
JDG.1.33	Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; and the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath became forced labor for them.
JDG.1.34	Then the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the valley; 
JDG.1.35	yet the Amorites persisted in living in Mount Heres, in Aijalon and in Shaalbim; but when the power of the house of Joseph grew strong, they became forced labor. 
JDG.1.36	The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.

JDG.2.10	All that generation also were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them who did not know the L

JDG.2.13	So they forsook the L

JDG.2.17	Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed themselves down to them. They turned aside quickly from the way in which their fathers had walked in obeying the commandments of the L

JDG.2.19	But it came about when the judge died, that they would turn back and act more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them and bow down to them; they did not abandon their practices or their stubborn ways. 
JDG.2.20	So the anger of the L

JDG.2.22	in order to test Israel by them, whether they will keep the way of the L

JDG.3.3	 the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath. 
JDG.3.4	They were for testing Israel, to find out if they would obey the commandments of the L
JDG.3.5	The sons of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; 
JDG.3.6	and they took their daughters for themselves as wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
JDG.3.7	The sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the L
JDG.3.8	Then the anger of the L
JDG.3.9	When the sons of Israel cried to the L
JDG.3.10	The Spirit of the L
JDG.3.11	Then the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
JDG.3.12	Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the L
JDG.3.13	And he gathered to himself the sons of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and defeated Israel, and they possessed the city of the palm trees. 
JDG.3.14	The sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
JDG.3.15	But when the sons of Israel cried to the L
JDG.3.16	Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his cloak. 
JDG.3.17	He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. 
JDG.3.18	It came about when he had finished presenting the tribute, that he sent away the people who had carried the tribute. 
JDG.3.19	But he himself turned back from the idols which were at Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” And he said, “Keep silence.” And all who attended him left him. 
JDG.3.20	Ehud came to him while he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” And he arose from his seat. 
JDG.3.21	Ehud stretched out his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly. 
JDG.3.22	The handle also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the refuse came out. 
JDG.3.23	Then Ehud went out into the vestibule and shut the doors of the roof chamber behind him, and locked 
JDG.3.24	When he had gone out, his servants came and looked, and behold, the doors of the roof chamber were locked; and they said, “He is only relieving himself in the cool room.” 
JDG.3.25	They waited until they became anxious; but behold, he did not open the doors of the roof chamber. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their master had fallen to the floor dead.
JDG.3.26	Now Ehud escaped while they were delaying, and he passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah. 
JDG.3.27	It came about when he had arrived, that he blew the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he 
JDG.3.28	He said to them, “Pursue 
JDG.3.29	They struck down at that time about ten thousand Moabites, all robust and valiant men; and no one escaped. 
JDG.3.30	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land was undisturbed for eighty years.
JDG.3.31	After him came Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad; and he also saved Israel.
JDG.4.1	Then the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the L
JDG.4.2	And the L
JDG.4.3	The sons of Israel cried to the L
JDG.4.4	Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. 
JDG.4.5	She used to sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment. 
JDG.4.6	Now she sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, “Behold, the L
JDG.4.7	I will draw out to you Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his many 
JDG.4.8	Then Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.” 
JDG.4.9	She said, “I will surely go with you; nevertheless, the honor shall not be yours on the journey that you are about to take, for the L
JDG.4.10	Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh, and ten thousand men went up with him; Deborah also went up with him.
JDG.4.11	Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, from the sons of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.
JDG.4.12	Then they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor. 
JDG.4.13	Sisera called together all his chariots, nine hundred iron chariots, and all the people who 
JDG.4.14	Deborah said to Barak, “Arise! For this is the day in which the L
JDG.4.15	The L
JDG.4.16	But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not even one was left.
JDG.4.17	Now Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite, for 
JDG.4.18	Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn aside, my master, turn aside to me! Do not be afraid.” And he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. 
JDG.4.19	He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a 
JDG.4.20	He said to her, “Stand in the doorway of the tent, and it shall be if anyone comes and inquires of you, and says, ‘Is there anyone here?’ that you shall say, ‘No.’ ” 
JDG.4.21	But Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg and seized a hammer in her hand, and went secretly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went through into the ground; for he was sound asleep and exhausted. So he died. 
JDG.4.22	And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” And he entered with her, and behold Sisera was lying dead with the tent peg in his temple.
JDG.4.23	So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the sons of Israel. 
JDG.4.24	The hand of the sons of Israel pressed heavier and heavier upon Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin the king of Canaan.
JDG.5.1	Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,
JDG.5.2	“That the leaders led in Israel,
JDG.5.2	That the people volunteered,

JDG.5.7	The peasantry ceased, they ceased in Israel,
JDG.5.7	Until I, Deborah, arose,
JDG.5.7	Until I arose, a mother in Israel.
JDG.5.8	New gods were chosen;

JDG.5.17	Asher sat at the seashore,
JDG.5.17	And remained by its landings.

JDG.5.18	And Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.
JDG.5.19	“The kings came

JDG.5.25	In a magnificent bowl she brought him curds.
JDG.5.26	She reached out her hand for the tent peg,
JDG.5.26	And her right hand for the workmen’s hammer.
JDG.5.26	Then she struck Sisera, she smashed his head;
JDG.5.26	And she shattered and pierced his temple.
JDG.5.27	Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay;
JDG.5.27	Between her feet he bowed, he fell;
JDG.5.27	Where he bowed, there he fell dead.
JDG.5.28	“Out of the window she looked and lamented,
JDG.5.28	The mother of Sisera through the lattice,
JDG.5.28	‘Why does his chariot delay in coming?
JDG.5.28	Why do the hoofbeats of his chariots tarry?’
JDG.5.29	Her wise princesses would answer her,
JDG.5.29	Indeed she repeats her words to herself,
JDG.5.30	‘Are they not finding, are they not dividing the spoil?
JDG.5.30	A maiden, two maidens for every warrior;
JDG.5.30	To Sisera a spoil of dyed work,

JDG.5.30	Dyed work of double embroidery on the neck of the spoiler?’
JDG.5.31	Thus let all Your enemies perish, O L
JDG.5.31	But let those who love Him be like the rising of the sun in its might.”
JDG.5.31	And the land was undisturbed for forty years.
JDG.6.1	Then the sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the L
JDG.6.2	The power of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of Midian the sons of Israel made for themselves the dens which were in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds. 
JDG.6.3	For it was when Israel had sown, that the Midianites would come up with the Amalekites and the sons of the east and go against them. 
JDG.6.4	So they would camp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel as well as no sheep, ox, or donkey. 
JDG.6.5	For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, they would come in like locusts for number, both they and their camels were innumerable; and they came into the land to devastate it. 
JDG.6.6	So Israel was brought very low because of Midian, and the sons of Israel cried to the L
JDG.6.7	Now it came about when the sons of Israel cried to the L
JDG.6.8	that the L
JDG.6.9	I delivered you from the hands of the Egyptians and from the hands of all your oppressors, and dispossessed them before you and gave you their land, 
JDG.6.10	and I said to you, “I am the L

JDG.6.16	But the L

JDG.6.18	Please do not depart from here, until I come 
JDG.6.19	Then Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from an 
JDG.6.20	The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And he did so. 
JDG.6.21	Then the angel of the L
JDG.6.22	When Gideon saw that he was the angel of the L
JDG.6.23	The L
JDG.6.24	Then Gideon built an altar there to the L
JDG.6.25	Now on the same night the L
JDG.6.26	and build an altar to the L
JDG.6.27	Then Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the L
JDG.6.28	When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was torn down, and the Asherah which was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar which had been built. 
JDG.6.29	They said to one another, “Who did this thing?” And when they searched about and inquired, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash did this thing.” 
JDG.6.30	Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has torn down the altar of Baal, and indeed, he has cut down the Asherah which was beside it.” 
JDG.6.31	But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Will you contend for Baal, or will you deliver him? Whoever will plead for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because someone has torn down his altar.” 
JDG.6.32	Therefore on that day he named him Jerubbaal, that is to say, “Let Baal contend against him,” because he had torn down his altar.
JDG.6.33	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the sons of the east assembled themselves; and they crossed over and camped in the valley of Jezreel. 
JDG.6.34	So the Spirit of the L
JDG.6.35	He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, and they also were called together to follow him; and he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.
JDG.6.36	Then Gideon said to God, “If You will deliver Israel through me, as You have spoken, 
JDG.6.37	behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I will know that You will deliver Israel through me, as You have spoken.” 
JDG.6.38	And it was so. When he arose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece, he drained the dew from the fleece, a bowl full of water. 
JDG.6.39	Then Gideon said to God, “Do not let Your anger burn against me that I may speak once more; please let me make a test once more with the fleece, let it now be dry only on the fleece, and let there be dew on all the ground.” 
JDG.6.40	God did so that night; for it was dry only on the fleece, and dew was on all the ground.
JDG.7.1	Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him, rose early and camped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley.
JDG.7.2	The L
JDG.7.3	Now therefore come, proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is afraid and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.’ ” So 22,000 people returned, but 10,000 remained.
JDG.7.4	Then the L
JDG.7.5	So he brought the people down to the water. And the L
JDG.7.6	Now the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was 300 men; but all the rest of the people kneeled to drink water. 
JDG.7.7	The L
JDG.7.8	So the 300 men took the people’s provisions and their trumpets into their hands. And Gideon sent all the 
JDG.7.9	Now the same night it came about that the L
JDG.7.10	But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp, 
JDG.7.11	and you will hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened that you may go down against the camp.” So he went with Purah his servant down to the outposts of the army that was in the camp. 
JDG.7.12	Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the sons of the east were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as numerous as the sand on the seashore. 
JDG.7.13	When Gideon came, behold, a man was relating a dream to his friend. And he said, “Behold, I had a dream; a loaf of barley bread was tumbling into the camp of Midian, and it came to the tent and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down so that the tent lay flat.” 
JDG.7.14	His friend replied, “This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has given Midian and all the camp into his hand.”
JDG.7.15	When Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. He returned to the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for the L
JDG.7.16	He divided the 300 men into three companies, and he put trumpets and empty pitchers into the hands of all of them, with torches inside the pitchers. 
JDG.7.17	He said to them, “Look at me and do likewise. And behold, when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do. 
JDG.7.18	When I and all who are with me blow the trumpet, then you also blow the trumpets all around the camp and say, ‘For the L
JDG.7.19	So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just posted the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the pitchers that were in their hands. 
JDG.7.20	When the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers, they held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands for blowing, and cried, “A sword for the L
JDG.7.21	Each stood in his place around the camp; and all the 
JDG.7.22	When they blew 300 trumpets, the L
JDG.7.23	The men of Israel were summoned from Naphtali and Asher and all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian.
JDG.7.24	Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against Midian and take the waters before them, as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.” So all the men of Ephraim were summoned and they took the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan. 
JDG.7.25	They captured the two leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and they killed Zeeb at the wine press of Zeeb, while they pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from across the Jordan.
JDG.8.1	Then the men of Ephraim said to him, “What is this thing you have done to us, not calling us when you went to fight against Midian?” And they contended with him vigorously. 
JDG.8.2	But he said to them, “What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning 
JDG.8.3	God has given the leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb into your hands; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?” Then their anger toward him subsided when he said that.
JDG.8.4	Then Gideon and the 300 men who were with him came to the Jordan 
JDG.8.5	He said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who are following me, for they are weary, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.” 
JDG.8.6	The leaders of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hands, that we should give bread to your army?” 
JDG.8.7	Gideon said, “All right, when the L
JDG.8.8	He went up from there to Penuel and spoke similarly to them; and the men of Penuel answered him just as the men of Succoth had answered. 
JDG.8.9	So he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, “When I return safely, I will tear down this tower.”
JDG.8.10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about 15,000 men, all who were left of the entire army of the sons of the east; for the fallen were 120,000 swordsmen. 
JDG.8.11	Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and attacked the camp when the camp was unsuspecting. 
JDG.8.12	When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army.
JDG.8.13	Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres. 
JDG.8.14	And he captured a youth from Succoth and questioned him. Then 
JDG.8.15	He came to the men of Succoth and said, “Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?’ ” 
JDG.8.16	He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and he disciplined the men of Succoth with them. 
JDG.8.17	He tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
JDG.8.18	Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men 
JDG.8.19	He said, “They 
JDG.8.20	So he said to Jether his firstborn, “Rise, kill them.” But the youth did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a youth. 
JDG.8.21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise up yourself, and fall on us; for as the man, so is his strength.” So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments which were on their camels’ necks.
JDG.8.22	Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, both you and your son, also your son’s son, for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.” 
JDG.8.23	But Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; the L
JDG.8.24	Yet Gideon said to them, “I would request of you, that each of you give me an earring from his spoil.” (For they had gold earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) 
JDG.8.25	They said, “We will surely give 
JDG.8.26	The weight of the gold earrings that he requested was 1,700 
JDG.8.27	Gideon made it into an ephod, and placed it in his city, Ophrah, and all Israel played the harlot with it there, so that it became a snare to Gideon and his household.
JDG.8.28	So Midian was subdued before the sons of Israel, and they did not lift up their heads anymore. And the land was undisturbed for forty years in the days of Gideon.
JDG.8.29	Then Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house. 
JDG.8.30	Now Gideon had seventy sons who were his direct descendants, for he had many wives. 
JDG.8.31	His concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech. 
JDG.8.32	And Gideon the son of Joash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
JDG.8.33	Then it came about, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the sons of Israel again played the harlot with the Baals, and made Baal-berith their god. 
JDG.8.34	Thus the sons of Israel did not remember the L
JDG.8.35	nor did they show kindness to the household of Jerubbaal (
JDG.9.1	And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother’s relatives, and spoke to them and to the whole clan of the household of his mother’s father, saying, 
JDG.9.2	“Speak, now, in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you, that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or that one man rule over you?’ Also, remember that I am your bone and your flesh.” 
JDG.9.3	And his mother’s relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem; and they were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our relative.” 
JDG.9.4	They gave him seventy 
JDG.9.5	Then he went to his father’s house at Ophrah and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself. 
JDG.9.6	All the men of Shechem and all 
JDG.9.7	Now when they told Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted his voice and called out. Thus he said to them, “Listen to me, O men of Shechem, that God may listen to you. 
JDG.9.8	Once the trees went forth to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us!’ 
JDG.9.9	But the olive tree said to them, ‘Shall I leave my fatness with which God and men are honored, and go to wave over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.10	Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come, reign over us!’ 
JDG.9.11	But the fig tree said to them, ‘Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to wave over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.12	Then the trees said to the vine, ‘You come, reign over us!’ 
JDG.9.13	But the vine said to them, ‘Shall I leave my new wine, which cheers God and men, and go to wave over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.14	Finally all the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come, reign over us!’ 
JDG.9.15	The bramble said to the trees, ‘If in truth you are anointing me as king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, may fire come out from the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.’
JDG.9.16	“Now therefore, if you have dealt in truth and integrity in making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have dealt with him as he deserved— 
JDG.9.17	for my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian; 
JDG.9.18	but you have risen against my father’s house today and have killed his sons, seventy men, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your relative— 
JDG.9.19	if then you have dealt in truth and integrity with Jerubbaal and his house this day, rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. 
JDG.9.20	But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the men of Shechem and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from Beth-millo, and consume Abimelech.” 
JDG.9.21	Then Jotham escaped and fled, and went to Beer and remained there because of Abimelech his brother.
JDG.9.22	Now Abimelech ruled over Israel three years. 
JDG.9.23	Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech, 
JDG.9.24	so that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers. 
JDG.9.25	The men of Shechem set men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who might pass by them along the road; and it was told to Abimelech.
JDG.9.26	Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his relatives, and crossed over into Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him. 
JDG.9.27	They went out into the field and gathered 
JDG.9.28	Then Gaal the son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and 
JDG.9.29	Would, therefore, that this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelech.” And he said to Abimelech, “Increase your army and come out.”
JDG.9.30	When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger burned. 
JDG.9.31	He sent messengers to Abimelech deceitfully, saying, “Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem; and behold, they are stirring up the city against you. 
JDG.9.32	Now therefore, arise by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field. 
JDG.9.33	In the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early and rush upon the city; and behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you shall do to them whatever you can.”
JDG.9.34	So Abimelech and all the people who 
JDG.9.35	Now Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the city gate; and Abimelech and the people who 
JDG.9.36	When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains.” But Zebul said to him, “You are seeing the shadow of the mountains as 
JDG.9.37	Gaal spoke again and said, “Behold, people are coming down from the highest part of the land, and one company comes by the way of the diviners’ oak.” 
JDG.9.38	Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your boasting now with which you said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Is this not the people whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them!” 
JDG.9.39	So Gaal went out before the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech. 
JDG.9.40	Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him; and many fell wounded up to the entrance of the gate. 
JDG.9.41	Then Abimelech remained at Arumah, but Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives so that they could not remain in Shechem.
JDG.9.42	Now it came about the next day, that the people went out to the field, and it was told to Abimelech. 
JDG.9.43	So he took his people and divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field; when he looked and saw the people coming out from the city, he arose against them and slew them. 
JDG.9.44	Then Abimelech and the company who was with him dashed forward and stood in the entrance of the city gate; the other two companies then dashed against all who 
JDG.9.45	Abimelech fought against the city all that day, and he captured the city and killed the people who 
JDG.9.46	When all the leaders of the tower of Shechem heard of 
JDG.9.47	It was told Abimelech that all the leaders of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. 
JDG.9.48	So Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who 
JDG.9.49	All the people also cut down each one his branch and followed Abimelech, and put 
JDG.9.50	Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he camped against Thebez and captured it. 
JDG.9.51	But there was a strong tower in the center of the city, and all the men and women with all the leaders of the city fled there and shut themselves in; and they went up on the roof of the tower. 
JDG.9.52	So Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and approached the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire. 
JDG.9.53	But a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, crushing his skull. 
JDG.9.54	Then he called quickly to the young man, his armor bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that it will not be said of me, ‘A woman slew him.’ ” So the young man pierced him through, and he died. 
JDG.9.55	When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, each departed to his home. 
JDG.9.56	Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father in killing his seventy brothers. 
JDG.9.57	Also God returned all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their heads, and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came upon them.
JDG.10.1	Now after Abimelech died, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to save Israel; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.10.2	He judged Israel twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried in Shamir.
JDG.10.3	After him, Jair the Gileadite arose and judged Israel twenty-two years. 
JDG.10.4	He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty cities in the land of Gilead that are called Havvoth-jair to this day. 
JDG.10.5	And Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
JDG.10.6	Then the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the L
JDG.10.7	The anger of the L
JDG.10.8	They afflicted and crushed the sons of Israel that year; for eighteen years they 
JDG.10.9	The sons of Ammon crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was greatly distressed.
JDG.10.10	Then the sons of Israel cried out to the L
JDG.10.11	The L
JDG.10.12	Also when the Sidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you, you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hands. 
JDG.10.13	Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods; therefore I will no longer deliver you. 
JDG.10.14	Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your distress.” 
JDG.10.15	The sons of Israel said to the L
JDG.10.16	So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the L
JDG.10.17	Then the sons of Ammon were summoned and they camped in Gilead. And the sons of Israel gathered together and camped in Mizpah. 
JDG.10.18	The people, the leaders of Gilead, said to one another, “Who is the man who will begin to fight against the sons of Ammon? He shall become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
JDG.11.1	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a valiant warrior, but he was the son of a harlot. And Gilead was the father of Jephthah. 
JDG.11.2	Gilead’s wife bore him sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, “You shall not have an inheritance in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman.” 
JDG.11.3	So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob; and worthless fellows gathered themselves about Jephthah, and they went out with him.
JDG.11.4	It came about after a while that the sons of Ammon fought against Israel. 
JDG.11.5	When the sons of Ammon fought against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob; 
JDG.11.6	and they said to Jephthah, “Come and be our chief that we may fight against the sons of Ammon.” 
JDG.11.7	Then Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Did you not hate me and drive me from my father’s house? So why have you come to me now when you are in trouble?” 
JDG.11.8	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “For this reason we have now returned to you, that you may go with us and fight with the sons of Ammon and become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.” 
JDG.11.9	So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you take me back to fight against the sons of Ammon and the L
JDG.11.10	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The L
JDG.11.11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the L
JDG.11.12	Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the sons of Ammon, saying, “What is between you and me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?” 
JDG.11.13	The king of the sons of Ammon said to the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took away my land when they came up from Egypt, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok and the Jordan; therefore, return them peaceably now.” 
JDG.11.14	But Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the sons of Ammon, 
JDG.11.15	and they said to him, “Thus says Jephthah, ‘Israel did not take away the land of Moab nor the land of the sons of Ammon. 
JDG.11.16	For when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh, 
JDG.11.17	then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, “Please let us pass through your land,” but the king of Edom would not listen. And they also sent to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh. 
JDG.11.18	Then they went through the wilderness and around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came to the east side of the land of Moab, and they camped beyond the Arnon; but they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon 
JDG.11.19	And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, “Please let us pass through your land to our place.” 
JDG.11.20	But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; so Sihon gathered all his people and camped in Jahaz and fought with Israel. 
JDG.11.21	The L
JDG.11.22	So they possessed all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and from the wilderness as far as the Jordan. 
JDG.11.23	Since now the L

JDG.11.25	Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive with Israel, or did he ever fight against them? 
JDG.11.26	While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon, three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time? 
JDG.11.27	I therefore have not sinned against you, but you are doing me wrong by making war against me; may the L
JDG.11.28	But the king of the sons of Ammon disregarded the message which Jephthah sent him.
JDG.11.29	Now the Spirit of the L
JDG.11.30	Jephthah made a vow to the L
JDG.11.31	then it shall be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon, it shall be the L
JDG.11.32	So Jephthah crossed over to the sons of Ammon to fight against them; and the L
JDG.11.33	He struck them with a very great slaughter from Aroer to the entrance of Minnith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim. So the sons of Ammon were subdued before the sons of Israel.
JDG.11.34	When Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, behold, his daughter was coming out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing. Now she was his one 
JDG.11.35	When he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are among those who trouble me; for I have given my word to the L
JDG.11.36	So she said to him, “My father, you have given your word to the L
JDG.11.37	She said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me; let me alone two months, that I may go to the mountains and weep because of my virginity, I and my companions.” 
JDG.11.38	Then he said, “Go.” So he sent her away for two months; and she left with her companions, and wept on the mountains because of her virginity. 
JDG.11.39	At the end of two months she returned to her father, who did to her according to the vow which he had made; and she had no relations with a man. Thus it became a custom in Israel, 
JDG.11.40	that the daughters of Israel went yearly to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.
JDG.12.1	Then the men of Ephraim were summoned, and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight against the sons of Ammon without calling us to go with you? We will burn your house down on you.” 
JDG.12.2	Jephthah said to them, “I and my people were at great strife with the sons of Ammon; when I called you, you did not deliver me from their hand. 
JDG.12.3	When I saw that you would not deliver 
JDG.12.4	Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought Ephraim; and the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, “You are fugitives of Ephraim, O Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim 
JDG.12.5	The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan opposite Ephraim. And it happened when 
JDG.12.6	then they would say to him, “Say now, ‘Shibboleth.’ ” But he said, “Sibboleth,” for he could not pronounce it correctly. Then they seized him and slew him at the fords of the Jordan. Thus there fell at that time 42,000 of Ephraim.
JDG.12.7	Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in 
JDG.12.8	Now Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel after him. 
JDG.12.9	He had thirty sons, and thirty daughters 
JDG.12.10	Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem.
JDG.12.11	Now Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel after him; and he judged Israel ten years. 
JDG.12.12	Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
JDG.12.13	Now Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel after him. 
JDG.12.14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys; and he judged Israel eight years. 
JDG.12.15	Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
JDG.13.1	Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the L
JDG.13.2	There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and had borne no

JDG.13.5	For behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and no razor shall come upon his head, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines.” 
JDG.13.6	Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, “A man of God came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. And I did not ask him where he 
JDG.13.7	But he said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and now you shall not drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.’ ”
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah entreated the L
JDG.13.9	God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she was sitting in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her. 
JDG.13.10	So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, “Behold, the man who came the 
JDG.13.11	Then Manoah arose and followed his wife, and when he came to the man he said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to the woman?” And he said, “I am.” 
JDG.13.12	Manoah said, “Now when your words come 
JDG.13.13	So the angel of the L
JDG.13.14	She should not eat anything that comes from the vine nor drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; let her observe all that I commanded.”
JDG.13.15	Then Manoah said to the angel of the L
JDG.13.16	The angel of the L
JDG.13.17	Manoah said to the angel of the L
JDG.13.18	But the angel of the L
JDG.13.19	So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering and offered it on the rock to the L
JDG.13.20	For it came about when the flame went up from the altar toward heaven, that the angel of the L
JDG.13.21	Now the angel of the L

JDG.13.23	But his wife said to him, “If the L

JDG.13.25	And the Spirit of the L
JDG.14.1	Then Samson went down to Timnah and saw a woman in Timnah, 
JDG.14.2	So he came back and told his father and mother, “I saw a woman in Timnah, 
JDG.14.3	Then his father and his mother said to him, “Is there no woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?” But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she looks good to me.” 
JDG.14.4	However, his father and mother did not know that it was of the L
JDG.14.5	Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came as far as the vineyards of Timnah; and behold, a young lion 
JDG.14.6	The Spirit of the L
JDG.14.7	So he went down and talked to the woman; and she looked good to Samson. 
JDG.14.8	When he returned later to take her, he turned aside to look at the carcass of the lion; and behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the body of the lion. 
JDG.14.9	So he scraped the honey into his hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and mother, he gave 
JDG.14.10	Then his father went down to the woman; and Samson made a feast there, for the young men customarily did this. 
JDG.14.11	When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.
JDG.14.12	Then Samson said to them, “Let me now propound a riddle to you; if you will indeed tell it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen wraps and thirty changes of clothes. 
JDG.14.13	But if you are unable to tell me, then you shall give me thirty linen wraps and thirty changes of clothes.” And they said to him, “Propound your riddle, that we may hear it.” 
JDG.14.14	So he said to them,
JDG.14.14	“Out of the eater came something to eat,
JDG.14.14	And out of the strong came something sweet.”
JDG.14.14	But they could not tell the riddle in three days.
JDG.14.15	Then it came about on the fourth day that they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband, so that he will tell us the riddle, or we will burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you invited us to impoverish us? Is this not 
JDG.14.16	Samson’s wife wept before him and said, “You only hate me, and you do not love me; you have propounded a riddle to the sons of my people, and have not told 
JDG.14.17	However she wept before him seven days while their feast lasted. And on the seventh day he told her because she pressed him so hard. She then told the riddle to the sons of her people. 
JDG.14.18	So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down,
JDG.14.18	“What is sweeter than honey?
JDG.14.18	And what is stronger than a lion?”
JDG.14.18	And he said to them,
JDG.14.18	“If you had not plowed with my heifer,
JDG.14.18	You would not have found out my riddle.”
JDG.14.19	Then the Spirit of the L
JDG.14.20	But Samson’s wife was 
JDG.15.1	But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat, and said, “I will go in to my wife in 
JDG.15.2	Her father said, “I really thought that you hated her intensely; so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please let her be yours instead.” 
JDG.15.3	Samson then said to them, “This time I shall be blameless in regard to the Philistines when I do them harm.” 
JDG.15.4	Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned 
JDG.15.5	When he had set fire to the torches, he released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines, thus burning up both the shocks and the standing grain, along with the vineyards 
JDG.15.6	Then the Philistines said, “Who did this?” And they said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his companion.” So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire. 
JDG.15.7	Samson said to them, “Since you act like this, I will surely take revenge on you, but after that I will quit.” 
JDG.15.8	He struck them ruthlessly with a great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
JDG.15.9	Then the Philistines went up and camped in Judah, and spread out in Lehi. 
JDG.15.10	The men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” And they said, “We have come up to bind Samson in order to do to him as he did to us.” 
JDG.15.11	Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam and said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?” And he said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.” 
JDG.15.12	They said to him, “We have come down to bind you so that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines.” And Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not kill me.” 
JDG.15.13	So they said to him, “No, but we will bind you fast and give you into their hands; yet surely we will not kill you.” Then they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.
JDG.15.14	When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him. And the Spirit of the L
JDG.15.15	He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, so he reached out and took it and killed a thousand men with it. 
JDG.15.16	Then Samson said,
JDG.15.16	“With the jawbone of a donkey,
JDG.15.16	Heaps upon heaps,
JDG.15.16	With the jawbone of a donkey
JDG.15.16	I have killed a thousand men.”
JDG.15.17	When he had finished speaking, he threw the jawbone from his hand; and he named that place 
JDG.15.18	Then he became very thirsty, and he called to the L
JDG.15.19	But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi so that water came out of it. When he drank, his strength returned and he revived. Therefore he named it En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day. 
JDG.15.20	So he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
JDG.16.1	Now Samson went to Gaza and saw a harlot there, and went in to her. 
JDG.16.2	 to the Gazites, saying, “Samson has come here,” they surrounded 
JDG.16.3	Now Samson lay until midnight, and at midnight he arose and took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two posts and pulled them up along with the bars; then he put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain which is opposite Hebron.
JDG.16.4	After this it came about that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. 
JDG.16.5	The lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, “Entice him, and see where his great strength 
JDG.16.6	So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength is and how you may be bound to afflict you.” 
JDG.16.7	Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh cords that have not been dried, then I will become weak and be like any 
JDG.16.8	Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh cords that had not been dried, and she bound him with them. 
JDG.16.9	Now she had 
JDG.16.10	Then Delilah said to Samson, “Behold, you have deceived me and told me lies; now please tell me how you may be bound.” 
JDG.16.11	He said to her, “If they bind me tightly with new ropes which have not been used, then I will become weak and be like any 
JDG.16.12	So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” For the 
JDG.16.13	Then Delilah said to Samson, “Up to now you have deceived me and told me lies; tell me how you may be bound.” And he said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my hair with the web 
JDG.16.14	So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his hair and wove them into the web]. And she fastened 
JDG.16.15	Then she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have deceived me these three times and have not told me where your great strength is.” 
JDG.16.16	It came about when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him, that his soul was annoyed to death. 
JDG.16.17	So he told her all 
JDG.16.18	When Delilah saw that he had told her all 
JDG.16.19	She made him sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his hair. Then she began to afflict him, and his strength left him. 
JDG.16.20	She said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And he awoke from his sleep and said, “I will go out as at other times and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the L
JDG.16.21	Then the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze chains, and he was a grinder in the prison. 
JDG.16.22	However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it was shaved off.
JDG.16.23	Now the lords of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice, for they said,
JDG.16.23	“Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hands.”
JDG.16.24	When the people saw him, they praised their god, for they said,
JDG.16.24	“Our god has given our enemy into our hands,
JDG.16.24	Even the destroyer of our country,
JDG.16.24	Who has slain many of us.”
JDG.16.25	It so happened when they were in high spirits, that they said, “Call for Samson, that he may amuse us.” So they called for Samson from the prison, and he entertained them. And they made him stand between the pillars. 
JDG.16.26	Then Samson said to the boy who was holding his hand, “Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them.” 
JDG.16.27	Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there. And about 3,000 men and women were on the roof looking on while Samson was amusing 
JDG.16.28	Then Samson called to the L
JDG.16.29	Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and braced himself against them, the one with his right hand and the other with his left. 
JDG.16.30	And Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” And he bent with all his might so that the house fell on the lords and all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he killed in his life. 
JDG.16.31	Then his brothers and all his father’s household came down, took him, brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. Thus he had judged Israel twenty years.
JDG.17.1	Now there was a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah. 
JDG.17.2	He said to his mother, “The eleven hundred 
JDG.17.3	He then returned the eleven hundred 
JDG.17.4	So when he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took two hundred 
JDG.17.5	And the man Micah had a 
JDG.17.6	In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
JDG.17.7	Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he was staying there. 
JDG.17.8	Then the man departed from the city, from Bethlehem in Judah, to stay wherever he might find 
JDG.17.9	Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to stay wherever I may find 
JDG.17.10	Micah then said to him, “Dwell with me and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten 
JDG.17.11	The Levite agreed to live with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons. 
JDG.17.12	So Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in the house of Micah. 
JDG.17.13	Then Micah said, “Now I know that the L
JDG.18.1	In those days there was no king of Israel; and in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance for themselves to live in, for until that day an inheritance had not been allotted to them as a possession among the tribes of Israel. 
JDG.18.2	So the sons of Dan sent from their family five men out of their whole number, valiant men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to search it; and they said to them, “Go, search the land.” And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. 
JDG.18.3	When they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite; and they turned aside there and said to him, “Who brought you here? And what are you doing in this 
JDG.18.4	He said to them, “Thus and so has Micah done to me, and he has hired me and I have become his priest.” 
JDG.18.5	They said to him, “Inquire of God, please, that we may know whether our way on which we are going will be prosperous.” 
JDG.18.6	The priest said to them, “Go in peace; your way in which you are going has the L
JDG.18.7	Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were in it living in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no ruler humiliating 
JDG.18.8	When they came back to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, “What 
JDG.18.9	They said, “Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. And will you sit still? Do not delay to go, to enter, to possess the land. 
JDG.18.10	When you enter, you will come to a secure people with a spacious land; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth.”
JDG.18.11	Then from the family of the Danites, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, six hundred men armed with weapons of war set out. 
JDG.18.12	They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they called that place 
JDG.18.13	They passed from there to the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah.
JDG.18.14	Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish said to their kinsmen, “Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod and 
JDG.18.15	They turned aside there and came to the house of the young man, the Levite, to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare. 
JDG.18.16	The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the sons of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate. 
JDG.18.17	Now the five men who went to spy out the land went up 
JDG.18.18	When these went into Micah’s house and took the graven image, the ephod and household idols and the molten image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?” 
JDG.18.19	They said to him, “Be silent, put your hand over your mouth and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?” 
JDG.18.20	The priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod and household idols and the graven image and went among the people.
JDG.18.21	Then they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the livestock and the valuables in front of them. 
JDG.18.22	When they had gone some distance from the house of Micah, the men who 
JDG.18.23	They cried to the sons of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, “What is 
JDG.18.24	He said, “You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away, and what do I have besides? So how can you say to me, ‘What is 
JDG.18.25	The sons of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard among us, or else fierce men will fall upon you and you will lose your life, with the lives of your household.” 
JDG.18.26	So the sons of Dan went on their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
JDG.18.27	Then they took what Micah had made and the priest who had belonged to him, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burned the city with fire. 
JDG.18.28	And there was no one to deliver 
JDG.18.29	They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father who was born in Israel; however, the name of the city formerly was Laish. 
JDG.18.30	The sons of Dan set up for themselves the graven image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of 
JDG.18.31	So they set up for themselves Micah’s graven image which he had made, all the time that the house of God was at Shiloh.
JDG.19.1	Now it came about in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite staying in the remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, who took a concubine for himself from Bethlehem in Judah. 
JDG.19.2	But his concubine played the harlot against him, and she went away from him to her father’s house in Bethlehem in Judah, and was there for a period of four months. 
JDG.19.3	Then her husband arose and went after her to speak tenderly to her in order to bring her back, taking with him his servant and a pair of donkeys. So she brought him into her father’s house, and when the girl’s father saw him, he was glad to meet him. 
JDG.19.4	His father-in-law, the girl’s father, detained him; and he remained with him three days. So they ate and drank and lodged there. 
JDG.19.5	Now on the fourth day they got up early in the morning, and he prepared to go; and the girl’s father said to his son-in-law, “Sustain yourself with a piece of bread, and afterward you may go.” 
JDG.19.6	So both of them sat down and ate and drank together; and the girl’s father said to the man, “Please be willing to spend the night, and let your heart be merry.” 
JDG.19.7	Then the man arose to go, but his father-in-law urged him so that he spent the night there again. 
JDG.19.8	On the fifth day he arose to go early in the morning, and the girl’s father said, “Please sustain yourself, and wait until afternoon”; so both of them ate. 
JDG.19.9	When the man arose to go along with his concubine and servant, his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him, “Behold now, the day has drawn to a close; please spend the night. Lo, the day is coming to an end; spend the night here that your heart may be merry. Then tomorrow you may arise early for your journey so that you may go home.”
JDG.19.10	But the man was not willing to spend the night, so he arose and departed and came to 
JDG.19.11	When they 
JDG.19.12	However, his master said to him, “We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners who are not of the sons of Israel; but we will go on as far as Gibeah.” 
JDG.19.13	He said to his servant, “Come and let us approach one of these places; and we will spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah.” 
JDG.19.14	So they passed along and went their way, and the sun set on them near Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin. 
JDG.19.15	They turned aside there in order to enter 
JDG.19.16	Then behold, an old man was coming out of the field from his work at evening. Now the man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was staying in Gibeah, but the men of the place were Benjamites. 
JDG.19.17	And he lifted up his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city; and the old man said, “Where are you going, and where do you come from?” 
JDG.19.18	He said to him, “We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, 
JDG.19.19	Yet there is both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and also bread and wine for me, your maidservant, and the young man who is with your servants; there is no lack of anything.” 
JDG.19.20	The old man said, “Peace to you. Only let me 
JDG.19.21	So he took him into his house and gave the donkeys fodder, and they washed their feet and ate and drank.
JDG.19.22	While they were celebrating, behold, the men of the city, certain worthless fellows, surrounded the house, pounding the door; and they spoke to the owner of the house, the old man, saying, “Bring out the man who came into your house that we may have relations with him.” 
JDG.19.23	Then the man, the owner of the house, went out to them and said to them, “No, my fellows, please do not act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, do not commit this act of folly. 
JDG.19.24	Here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. Please let me bring them out that you may ravish them and do to them whatever you wish. But do not commit such an act of folly against this man.” 
JDG.19.25	But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and brought 
JDG.19.26	As the day began to dawn, the woman came and fell down at the doorway of the man’s house where her master was, until 
JDG.19.27	When her master arose in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, then behold, his concubine was lying at the doorway of the house with her hands on the threshold. 
JDG.19.28	He said to her, “Get up and let us go,” but there was no answer. Then he placed her on the donkey; and the man arose and went to his home. 
JDG.19.29	When he entered his house, he took a knife and laid hold of his concubine and cut her in twelve pieces, limb by limb, and sent her throughout the territory of Israel. 
JDG.19.30	All who saw 
JDG.20.1	Then all the sons of Israel from Dan to Beersheba, including the land of Gilead, came out, and the congregation assembled as one man to the L
JDG.20.2	The chiefs of all the people, 
JDG.20.3	(Now the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the sons of Israel said, “Tell 
JDG.20.4	So the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, “I came with my concubine to spend the night at Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin. 
JDG.20.5	But the men of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house at night because of me. They intended to kill me; instead, they ravished my concubine so that she died. 
JDG.20.6	And I took hold of my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout the land of Israel’s inheritance; for they have committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel. 
JDG.20.7	Behold, all you sons of Israel, give your advice and counsel here.”
JDG.20.8	Then all the people arose as one man, saying, “Not one of us will go to his tent, nor will any of us return to his house. 
JDG.20.9	But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah; 
JDG.20.10	And we will take 10 men out of 100 throughout the tribes of Israel, and 100 out of 1,000, and 1,000 out of 10,000 to supply food for the people, that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may punish 
JDG.20.11	Thus all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united as one man.
JDG.20.12	Then the tribes of Israel sent men through the entire tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this wickedness that has taken place among you? 
JDG.20.13	Now then, deliver up the men, the 
JDG.20.14	The sons of Benjamin gathered from the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the sons of Israel. 
JDG.20.15	From the cities on that day the sons of Benjamin were numbered, 26,000 men who draw the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah who were numbered, 700 choice men. 
JDG.20.16	Out of all these people 700 choice men were left-handed; each one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
JDG.20.17	Then the men of Israel besides Benjamin were numbered, 400,000 men who draw the sword; all these were men of war.
JDG.20.18	Now the sons of Israel arose, went up to Bethel, and inquired of God and said, “Who shall go up first for us to battle against the sons of Benjamin?” Then the L
JDG.20.19	So the sons of Israel arose in the morning and camped against Gibeah. 
JDG.20.20	The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel arrayed for battle against them at Gibeah. 
JDG.20.21	Then the sons of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and felled to the ground on that day 22,000 men of Israel. 
JDG.20.22	But the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and arrayed for battle again in the place where they had arrayed themselves the first day. 
JDG.20.23	The sons of Israel went up and wept before the L
JDG.20.24	Then the sons of Israel came against the sons of Benjamin the second day. 
JDG.20.25	Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah the second day and felled to the ground again 18,000 men of the sons of Israel; all these drew the sword. 
JDG.20.26	Then all the sons of Israel and all the people went up and came to Bethel and wept; thus they remained there before the L
JDG.20.27	The sons of Israel inquired of the L
JDG.20.28	and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, Aaron’s son, stood before it to 
JDG.20.29	So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah. 
JDG.20.30	The sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day and arrayed themselves against Gibeah as at other times. 
JDG.20.31	The sons of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city, and they began to strike and kill some of the people as at other times, on the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, 
JDG.20.32	The sons of Benjamin said, “They are struck down before us, as at the first.” But the sons of Israel said, “Let us flee that we may draw them away from the city to the highways.” 
JDG.20.33	Then all the men of Israel arose from their place and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar; and the men of Israel in ambush broke out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba. 
JDG.20.34	When ten thousand choice men from all Israel came against Gibeah, the battle became fierce; but Benjamin did not know that disaster was close to them. 
JDG.20.35	And the L
JDG.20.36	So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. When the men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah, 
JDG.20.37	the men in ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah; the men in ambush also deployed and struck all the city with the edge of the sword. 
JDG.20.38	Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise from the city. 
JDG.20.39	Then the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel, for they said, “Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle.” 
JDG.20.40	But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, Benjamin looked behind them; and behold, the whole city was going up 
JDG.20.41	Then the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were terrified; for they saw that disaster was close to them. 
JDG.20.42	Therefore, they turned their backs before the men of Israel toward the direction of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them while those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of them. 
JDG.20.43	They surrounded Benjamin, pursued them without rest 
JDG.20.44	Thus 18,000 men of Benjamin fell; all these were valiant warriors. 
JDG.20.45	The rest turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, but they caught 5,000 of them on the highways and overtook them at Gidom and killed 2,000 of them. 
JDG.20.46	So all of Benjamin who fell that day were 25,000 men who draw the sword; all these were valiant warriors. 
JDG.20.47	But 600 men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they remained at the rock of Rimmon four months. 
JDG.20.48	The men of Israel then turned back against the sons of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city with the cattle and all that they found; they also set on fire all the cities which they found.
JDG.21.1	Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, “None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin in marriage.” 
JDG.21.2	So the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly. 
JDG.21.3	They said, “Why, O L
JDG.21.4	It came about the next day that the people arose early and built an altar there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
JDG.21.5	Then the sons of Israel said, “Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up in the assembly to the L
JDG.21.6	And the sons of Israel were sorry for their brother Benjamin and said, “One tribe is cut off from Israel today. 
JDG.21.7	What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the L
JDG.21.8	And they said, “What one is there of the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the L
JDG.21.9	For when the people were numbered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there. 
JDG.21.10	And the congregation sent 12,000 of the valiant warriors there, and commanded them, saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones. 
JDG.21.11	This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every man and every woman who has lain with a man.” 
JDG.21.12	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
JDG.21.13	Then the whole congregation sent 
JDG.21.14	Benjamin returned at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jabesh-gilead; yet they were not enough for them. 
JDG.21.15	And the people were sorry for Benjamin because the L
JDG.21.16	Then the elders of the congregation said, “What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?” 
JDG.21.17	They said, “
JDG.21.18	But we cannot give them wives of our daughters.” For the sons of Israel had sworn, saying, “Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.”
JDG.21.19	So they said, “Behold, there is a feast of the L
JDG.21.20	And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, “Go and lie in wait in the vineyards, 
JDG.21.21	and watch; and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to take part in the dances, then you shall come out of the vineyards and each of you shall catch his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. 
JDG.21.22	It shall come about, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we shall say to them, ‘Give them to us voluntarily, because we did not take for each man 
JDG.21.23	The sons of Benjamin did so, and took wives according to their number from those who danced, whom they carried away. And they went and returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the cities and lived in them. 
JDG.21.24	The sons of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family, and each one of them went out from there to his inheritance.
JDG.21.25	In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
RUT.1.1	Now it came about in the days when the judges governed, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons.

RUT.1.14	And they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.
RUT.1.15	Then she said, “Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods; return after your sister-in-law.” 
RUT.1.16	But Ruth said, “Do not urge me to leave you

RUT.1.18	When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more to her.
RUT.1.19	So they both went until they came to Bethlehem. And when they had come to Bethlehem, all the city was stirred because of them, and the women said, “Is this Naomi?” 
RUT.1.20	She said to them, “Do not call me 
RUT.1.21	I went out full, but the L
RUT.1.22	So Naomi returned, and with her Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, who returned from the land of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.
RUT.2.1	Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. 
RUT.2.2	And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after one in whose sight I may find favor.” And she said to her, “Go, my daughter.” 
RUT.2.3	So she departed and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. 
RUT.2.4	Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “May the L
RUT.2.5	Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose young woman is this?” 
RUT.2.6	The servant in charge of the reapers replied, “She is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab. 
RUT.2.7	And she said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ Thus she came and has remained from the morning until now; she has been sitting in the house for a little while.”
RUT.2.8	Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen carefully, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field; furthermore, do not go on from this one, but stay here with my maids. 
RUT.2.9	Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Indeed, I have commanded the servants not to touch you. When you are thirsty, go to the water jars and drink from what the servants draw.” 
RUT.2.10	Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?” 
RUT.2.11	Boaz replied to her, “All that you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband has been fully reported to me, and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people that you did not previously know. 
RUT.2.12	May the L
RUT.2.13	Then she said, “I have found favor in your sight, my lord, for you have comforted me and indeed have spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your maidservants.”
RUT.2.14	At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come here, that you may eat of the bread and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers; and he served her roasted grain, and she ate and was satisfied and had some left. 
RUT.2.15	When she rose to glean, Boaz commanded his servants, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not insult her. 
RUT.2.16	Also you shall purposely pull out for her 
RUT.2.17	So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. 
RUT.2.18	She took 
RUT.2.19	Her mother-in-law then said to her, “Where did you glean today and where did you work? May he who took notice of you be blessed.” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, “The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.” 
RUT.2.20	Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed of the L
RUT.2.21	Then Ruth the Moabitess said, “Furthermore, he said to me, ‘You should stay close to my servants until they have finished all my harvest.’ ” 
RUT.2.22	Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maids, so that 
RUT.2.23	So she stayed close by the maids of Boaz in order to glean until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.1	Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, shall I not seek security for you, that it may be well with you? 
RUT.3.2	Now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids you were? Behold, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight.

RUT.3.5	She said to her, “All that you say I will do.”
RUT.3.6	So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her. 
RUT.3.7	When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came secretly, and uncovered his feet and lay down. 
RUT.3.8	It happened in the middle of the night that the man was startled and bent forward; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet. 
RUT.3.9	He said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth your maid. So spread your covering over your maid, for you are a

RUT.3.11	Now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you whatever you ask, for all my people in the city know that you are a woman of excellence. 
RUT.3.12	Now it is true I am a close relative; however, there is a relative closer than I. 
RUT.3.13	Remain this night, and when morning comes, if he will redeem you, good; let him redeem you. But if he does not wish to redeem you, then I will redeem you, as the L
RUT.3.14	So she lay at his feet until morning and rose before one could recognize another; and he said, “Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.” 
RUT.3.15	Again he said, “Give me the cloak that is on you and hold it.” So she held it, and he measured six

RUT.4.1	Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there, and behold, the close relative of whom Boaz spoke was passing by, so he said, “Turn aside, friend, sit down here.” And he turned aside and sat down. 
RUT.4.2	He took ten men of the elders of the city and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down. 
RUT.4.3	Then he said to the closest relative, “Naomi, who has come back from the land of Moab, has to sell the piece of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech. 
RUT.4.4	So I thought to inform you, saying, ‘Buy

RUT.4.10	Moreover, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, to be my wife in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance, so that the name of the deceased will not be cut off from his brothers or from the court of his

RUT.4.14	Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed is the L
RUT.4.15	May he also be to you a restorer of life and a sustainer of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.”
RUT.4.16	Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her lap, and became his nurse. 
RUT.4.17	The neighbor women gave him a name, saying, “A son has been born to Naomi!” So they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
RUT.4.18	Now these are the generations of Perez: to Perez was born Hezron, 
RUT.4.19	and to Hezron was born Ram, and to Ram, Amminadab, 
RUT.4.20	and to Amminadab was born Nahshon, and to Nahshon, Salmon, 
RUT.4.21	and to Salmon was born Boaz, and to Boaz, Obed, 
RUT.4.22	and to Obed was born Jesse, and to Jesse, David.
1SA.1.1	Now there was a certain man from Ramathaim-zophim from the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 
1SA.1.2	He had two wives: the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
1SA.1.3	Now this man would go up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the L
1SA.1.4	When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters;

1SA.1.9	Then Hannah rose after eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of the L

1SA.1.13	As for Hannah, she was speaking in her heart, only her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought she was drunk. 
1SA.1.14	Then Eli said to her, “How long will you make yourself drunk? Put away your wine from you.” 
1SA.1.15	But Hannah replied, “No, my lord, I am a woman oppressed in spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the L
1SA.1.16	Do not consider your maidservant as a worthless woman, for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and provocation.” 
1SA.1.17	Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of Him.” 
1SA.1.18	She said, “Let your maidservant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer

1SA.2.11	Then Elkanah went to his home at Ramah. But the boy ministered to the L
1SA.2.12	Now the sons of Eli were 
1SA.2.13	and the custom of the priests with the people. When any man was offering a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand. 
1SA.2.14	Then he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. Thus they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there. 
1SA.2.15	Also, before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the priest meat for roasting, as he will not take boiled meat from you, only raw.” 
1SA.2.16	If the man said to him, “They must surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as you desire,” then he would say, “No, but you shall give

1SA.2.19	And his mother would make him a little robe and bring it to him from year to year when she would come up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 
1SA.2.20	Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “May the L

1SA.2.22	Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting. 
1SA.2.23	He said to them, “Why do you do such things, the evil things that I hear from all these people? 
1SA.2.24	No, my sons; for the report is not good which I hear the L
1SA.2.25	If one man sins against another, God will mediate for him; but if a man sins against the L
1SA.2.26	Now the boy Samuel was growing in stature and in favor both with the L
1SA.2.27	Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “Thus says the L
1SA.2.28	Did I 
1SA.2.29	Why do you kick at My sacrifice and at My offering which I have commanded 
1SA.2.30	Therefore the L

1SA.2.34	This will be the sign to you which will come concerning your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: on the same day both of them will die. 
1SA.2.35	But I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who will do according to what is in My heart and in My soul; and I will build him an enduring house, and he will walk before My anointed always. 
1SA.2.36	Everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread and say, “Please assign me to one of the priest’s offices so that I may eat a piece of bread.” ’ ”
1SA.3.1	Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the L
1SA.3.2	It happened at that time as Eli was lying down in his place (now his eyesight had begun to grow dim 
1SA.3.3	and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the L
1SA.3.4	that the L
1SA.3.5	Then he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, lie down again.” So he went and lay down. 
1SA.3.6	The L
1SA.3.7	Now Samuel did not yet know the L
1SA.3.8	So the L
1SA.3.9	And Eli said to Samuel, “Go lie down, and it shall be if He calls you, that you shall say, ‘Speak, L

1SA.3.11	The L
1SA.3.12	In that day I will carry out against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. 
1SA.3.13	For I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves and he did not rebuke them. 
1SA.3.14	Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.”
1SA.3.15	So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the house of the L
1SA.3.16	Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And he said, “Here I am.” 
1SA.3.17	He said, “What is the word that He spoke to you? Please do not hide it from me. May God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the words that He spoke to you.” 
1SA.3.18	So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, “It is the L
1SA.3.19	Thus Samuel grew and the L
1SA.3.20	All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the L
1SA.3.21	And the L
1SA.4.1	Thus the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped beside Ebenezer while the Philistines camped in Aphek. 
1SA.4.2	The Philistines drew up in battle array to meet Israel. When the battle spread, Israel was defeated before the Philistines who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield. 
1SA.4.3	When the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the L
1SA.4.4	So the people sent to Shiloh, and from there they carried the ark of the covenant of the L
1SA.4.5	As the ark of the covenant of the L
1SA.4.6	When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What 
1SA.4.7	The Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.” And they said, “Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before. 
1SA.4.8	Woe to us! Who shall deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with all 
1SA.4.9	Take courage and be men, O Philistines, or you will become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you; therefore, be men and fight.”
1SA.4.10	So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent; and the slaughter was very great, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers. 
1SA.4.11	And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
1SA.4.12	Now a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn and dust on his head. 
1SA.4.13	When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on 
1SA.4.14	When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, “What 
1SA.4.15	Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were set so that he could not see. 
1SA.4.16	The man said to Eli, “I am the one who came from the battle line. Indeed, I escaped from the battle line today.” And he said, “How did things go, my son?” 
1SA.4.17	Then the one who brought the news replied, “Israel has fled before the Philistines and there has also been a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been taken.” 
1SA.4.18	When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell off the seat backward beside the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. Thus he judged Israel forty years.
1SA.4.19	Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was pregnant and about to give birth; and when she heard the news that the ark of God was taken and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she kneeled down and gave birth, for her pains came upon her. 
1SA.4.20	And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, “Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.” But she did not answer or pay attention. 
1SA.4.21	And she called the boy 
1SA.4.22	She said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God was taken.”
1SA.5.1	Now the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 
1SA.5.2	Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to the house of Dagon and set it by Dagon. 
1SA.5.3	When the Ashdodites arose early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the L
1SA.5.4	But when they arose early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the L
1SA.5.5	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor all who enter Dagon’s house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
1SA.5.6	Now the hand of the L
1SA.5.7	When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for His hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god.” 
1SA.5.8	So they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” And they said, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.” And they brought the ark of the God of Israel 
1SA.5.9	After they had brought it around, the hand of the L
1SA.5.10	So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And as the ark of God came to Ekron the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel around to us, to kill us and our people.” 
1SA.5.11	They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, so that it will not kill us and our people.” For there was a deadly confusion throughout the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. 
1SA.5.12	And the men who did not die were smitten with tumors and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1SA.6.1	Now the ark of the L
1SA.6.2	And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, “What shall we do with the ark of the L
1SA.6.3	They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty; but you shall surely return to Him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.” 
1SA.6.4	Then they said, “What shall be the guilt offering which we shall return to Him?” And they said, “Five golden tumors and five golden mice 
1SA.6.5	So you shall make likenesses of your tumors and likenesses of your mice that ravage the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will ease His hand from you, your gods, and your land. 
1SA.6.6	Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He had severely dealt with them, did they not allow the people to go, and they departed? 
1SA.6.7	Now therefore, take and prepare a new cart and two milch cows on which there has never been a yoke; and hitch the cows to the cart and take their calves home, away from them. 
1SA.6.8	Take the ark of the L
1SA.6.9	Watch, if it goes up by the way of its own territory to Beth-shemesh, then He has done us this great evil. But if not, then we will know that it was not His hand that struck us; it happened to us by chance.”
1SA.6.10	Then the men did so, and took two milch cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. 
1SA.6.11	They put the ark of the L
1SA.6.12	And the cows took the straight way in the direction of Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right or to the left. And the lords of the Philistines followed them to the border of Beth-shemesh.
1SA.6.13	Now 
1SA.6.14	The cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite and stood there where there 
1SA.6.15	The Levites took down the ark of the L
1SA.6.16	When the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned to Ekron that day.
1SA.6.17	These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a guilt offering to the L
1SA.6.18	and the golden mice, 
1SA.6.19	He struck down some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the L
1SA.6.20	The men of Beth-shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the L
1SA.6.21	So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back the ark of the L

1SA.7.2	From the day that the ark remained at Kiriath-jearim, the time was long, for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel lamented after the L
1SA.7.3	Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If you return to the L

1SA.7.5	Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah and I will pray to the L
1SA.7.6	They gathered to Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the L
1SA.7.7	Now when the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel had gathered to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the sons of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines. 
1SA.7.8	Then the sons of Israel said to Samuel, “Do not cease to cry to the L
1SA.7.9	Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it for a whole burnt offering to the L
1SA.7.10	Now Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, and the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the L
1SA.7.11	The men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them down as far as below Beth-car.
1SA.7.12	Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and named it 
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued and they did not come anymore within the border of Israel. And the hand of the L
1SA.7.14	The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel delivered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. So there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
1SA.7.15	Now Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
1SA.7.16	He used to go annually on circuit to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all these places. 
1SA.7.17	Then his return 
1SA.8.1	And it came about when Samuel was old that he appointed his sons judges over Israel. 
1SA.8.2	Now the name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; 
1SA.8.3	His sons, however, did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain and took bribes and perverted justice.
1SA.8.4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah; 
1SA.8.5	and they said to him, “Behold, you have grown old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint a king for us to judge us like all the nations.” 
1SA.8.6	But the thing was displeasing in the sight of Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” And Samuel prayed to the L
1SA.8.7	The L
1SA.8.8	Like all the deeds which they have done since the day that I brought them up from Egypt even to this day—in that they have forsaken Me and served other gods—so they are doing to you also. 
1SA.8.9	Now then, listen to their voice; however, you shall solemnly warn them and tell them of the 
1SA.8.10	So Samuel spoke all the words of the L
1SA.8.11	He said, “This will be the procedure of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and place 
1SA.8.12	He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and of fifties, and 
1SA.8.13	He will also take your daughters for perfumers and cooks and bakers. 
1SA.8.14	He will take the best of your fields and your vineyards and your olive groves and give 
1SA.8.15	He will take a tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants. 
1SA.8.16	He will also take your male servants and your female servants and your best young men and your donkeys and use 
1SA.8.17	He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his servants. 
1SA.8.18	Then you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the L
1SA.8.19	Nevertheless, the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and they said, “No, but there shall be a king over us, 
1SA.8.20	that we also may be like all the nations, that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.” 
1SA.8.21	Now after Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the L
1SA.8.22	The L
1SA.9.1	Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor. 
1SA.9.2	He had a son whose name was Saul, a choice and handsome 
1SA.9.3	Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. So Kish said to his son Saul, “Take now with you one of the servants, and arise, go search for the donkeys.” 
1SA.9.4	He passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find 
1SA.9.5	When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, and let us return, or else my father will cease 
1SA.9.6	He said to him, “Behold now, there is a man of God in this city, and the man is held in honor; all that he says surely comes true. Now let us go there, perhaps he can tell us about our journey on which we have set out.” 
1SA.9.7	Then Saul said to his servant, “But behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is gone from our sack and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?” 
1SA.9.8	The servant answered Saul again and said, “Behold, I have in my hand a fourth of a shekel of silver; I will give 
1SA.9.9	(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he used to say, “Come, and let us go to the seer”; for 
1SA.9.10	Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said; come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was.
1SA.9.11	As they went up the slope to the city, they found young women going out to draw water and said to them, “Is the seer here?” 
1SA.9.12	They answered them and said, “He is; see, 
1SA.9.13	As soon as you enter the city you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now therefore, go up for you will find him at once.” 
1SA.9.14	So they went up to the city. As they came into the city, behold, Samuel was coming out toward them to go up to the high place.
1SA.9.15	Now a day before Saul’s coming, the L
1SA.9.16	“About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over My people Israel; and he will deliver My people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have regarded My people, because their cry has come to Me.” 
1SA.9.17	When Samuel saw Saul, the L
1SA.9.18	Then Saul approached Samuel in the gate and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.” 
1SA.9.19	Samuel answered Saul and said, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is on your mind. 
1SA.9.20	As for your donkeys which were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father’s household?” 
1SA.9.21	Saul replied, “Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak to me in this way?”
1SA.9.22	Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who were invited, who were about thirty men. 
1SA.9.23	Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion that I gave you, concerning which I said to you, ‘Set it aside.’ ” 
1SA.9.24	Then the cook took up the leg with what was on it and set 
1SA.9.25	When they came down from the high place into the city, 
1SA.9.26	And they arose early; and at daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, “Get up, that I may send you away.” So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went out into the street. 
1SA.9.27	As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Say to the servant that he might go ahead of us and pass on, but you remain standing now, that I may proclaim the word of God to you.”
1SA.10.1	Then Samuel took the flask of oil, poured it on his head, kissed him and said, “Has not the L
1SA.10.2	When you go from me today, then you will find two men close to Rachel’s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, ‘The donkeys which you went to look for have been found. Now behold, your father has ceased to be concerned about the donkeys and is anxious for you, saying, “What shall I do about my son?” ’ 
1SA.10.3	Then you will go on further from there, and you will come as far as the oak of Tabor, and there three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a jug of wine; 
1SA.10.4	and they will greet you and give you two 
1SA.10.5	Afterward you will come to the hill of God where the Philistine garrison is; and it shall be as soon as you have come there to the city, that you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and a lyre before them, and they will be prophesying. 
1SA.10.6	Then the Spirit of the L
1SA.10.7	It shall be when these signs come to you, do for yourself what the occasion requires, for God is with you. 
1SA.10.8	And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice peace offerings. You shall wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you should do.”
1SA.10.9	Then it happened when he turned his back to leave Samuel, God changed his heart; and all those signs came about on that day. 
1SA.10.10	When they came to the hill there, behold, a group of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him mightily, so that he prophesied among them. 
1SA.10.11	It came about, when all who knew him previously saw that he prophesied now with the prophets, that the people said to one another, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
1SA.10.12	A man there said, “Now, who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb: “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
1SA.10.13	When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.
1SA.10.14	Now Saul’s uncle said to him and his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, “To look for the donkeys. When we saw that they could not be found, we went to Samuel.” 
1SA.10.15	Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me what Samuel said to you.” 
1SA.10.16	So Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingdom which Samuel had mentioned.
1SA.10.17	Thereafter Samuel called the people together to the L
1SA.10.18	and he said to the sons of Israel, “Thus says the L
1SA.10.19	But you have today rejected your God, who delivers you from all your calamities and your distresses; yet you have said, ‘No, but set a king over us!’ Now therefore, present yourselves before the L
1SA.10.20	Thus Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot. 
1SA.10.21	Then he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families, and the Matrite family was taken. And Saul the son of Kish was taken; but when they looked for him, he could not be found. 
1SA.10.22	Therefore they inquired further of the L
1SA.10.23	So they ran and took him from there, and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward. 
1SA.10.24	Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom the L
1SA.10.25	Then Samuel told the people the ordinances of the kingdom, and wrote 
1SA.10.26	Saul also went to his house at Gibeah; and the valiant 
1SA.10.27	But certain worthless men said, “How can this one deliver us?” And they despised him and did not bring him any present. But he kept silent.
1SA.11.1	Now Nahash the Ammonite came up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a covenant with us and we will serve you.” 
1SA.11.2	But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “I will make 
1SA.11.3	The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Let us alone for seven days, that we may send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to deliver us, we will come out to you.” 
1SA.11.4	Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and spoke these words in the hearing of the people, and all the people lifted up their voices and wept.
1SA.11.5	Now behold, Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen, and he said, “What is 
1SA.11.6	Then the Spirit of God came upon Saul mightily when he heard these words, and he became very angry. 
1SA.11.7	He took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, and sent 
1SA.11.8	He numbered them in Bezek; and the sons of Israel were 300,000, and the men of Judah 30,000. 
1SA.11.9	They said to the messengers who had come, “Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will have deliverance.’ ” So the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad. 
1SA.11.10	Then the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.” 
1SA.11.11	The next morning Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp at the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.
1SA.11.12	Then the people said to Samuel, “Who is he that said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring the men, that we may put them to death.” 
1SA.11.13	But Saul said, “Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today the L
1SA.11.14	Then Samuel said to the people, “Come and let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there.” 
1SA.11.15	So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the L
1SA.12.1	Then Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me and I have appointed a king over you. 
1SA.12.2	Now, here is the king walking before you, but I am old and gray, and behold my sons are with you. And I have walked before you from my youth even to this day. 
1SA.12.3	Here I am; bear witness against me before the L
1SA.12.4	They said, “You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man’s hand.” 
1SA.12.5	He said to them, “The L
1SA.12.6	Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the L

1SA.12.8	When Jacob went into Egypt and your fathers cried out to the L

1SA.12.13	Now therefore, here is the king whom you have chosen, whom you have asked for, and behold, the L

1SA.12.16	Even now, take your stand and see this great thing which the L
1SA.12.17	Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call to the L
1SA.12.18	So Samuel called to the L
1SA.12.19	Then all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to the L
1SA.12.20	Samuel said to the people, “Do not fear. You have committed all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following the L
1SA.12.21	You must not turn aside, for

1SA.12.23	Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the L
1SA.12.24	Only 
1SA.12.25	But if you still do wickedly, both you and your king will be swept away.”
1SA.13.1	Saul was 
1SA.13.2	Now Saul chose for himself 3,000 men of Israel, of which 2,000 were with Saul in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, while 1,000 were with Jonathan at Gibeah of Benjamin. But he sent away the rest of the people, each to his tent. 
1SA.13.3	Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of 
1SA.13.4	All Israel heard the news that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become odious to the Philistines. The people were then summoned to Saul at Gilgal.
1SA.13.5	Now the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and people like the sand which is on the seashore in abundance; and they came up and camped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven. 
1SA.13.6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were hard-pressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, in thickets, in cliffs, in cellars, and in pits. 
1SA.13.7	Also 
1SA.13.8	Now he waited seven days, according to the appointed time set by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattering from him. 
1SA.13.9	So Saul said, “Bring to me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” And he offered the burnt offering. 
1SA.13.10	As soon as he finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him 
1SA.13.11	But Samuel said, “What have you done?” And Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the appointed days, and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmash, 
1SA.13.12	therefore I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not asked the favor of the L
1SA.13.13	Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the L
1SA.13.14	But now your kingdom shall not endure. The L
1SA.13.15	Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men. 
1SA.13.16	Now Saul and his son Jonathan and the people who were present with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin while the Philistines camped at Michmash. 
1SA.13.17	And the raiders came from the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual, 
1SA.13.18	and another company turned toward Beth-horon, and another company turned toward the border which overlooks the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
1SA.13.19	Now no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears.” 
1SA.13.20	So all Israel went down to the Philistines, each to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, and his hoe. 
1SA.13.21	The charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to fix the hoes. 
1SA.13.22	So it came about on the day of battle that neither sword nor spear was found in the hands of any of the people who 
1SA.13.23	And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
1SA.14.1	Now the day came that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man who was carrying his armor, “Come and let us cross over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side.” But he did not tell his father. 
1SA.14.2	Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron. And the people who 
1SA.14.3	and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the L
1SA.14.4	Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to cross over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a sharp crag on the one side and a sharp crag on the other side, and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. 
1SA.14.5	The one crag rose on the north opposite Michmash, and the other on the south opposite Geba.
1SA.14.6	Then Jonathan said to the young man who was carrying his armor, “Come and let us cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; perhaps the L
1SA.14.7	His armor bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart; turn yourself, 
1SA.14.8	Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will cross over to the men and reveal ourselves to them. 
1SA.14.9	If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you’; then we will stand in our place and not go up to them. 
1SA.14.10	But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for the L
1SA.14.11	When both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, “Behold, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.” 
1SA.14.12	So the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor bearer and said, “Come up to us and we will tell you something.” And Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come up after me, for the L
1SA.14.13	Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, with his armor bearer behind him; and they fell before Jonathan, and his armor bearer put some to death after him. 
1SA.14.14	That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor bearer made was about twenty men within about half a furrow in an acre of land. 
1SA.14.15	And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. Even the garrison and the raiders trembled, and the earth quaked so that it became a 
1SA.14.16	Now Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude melted away; and they went here and 
1SA.14.17	Saul said to the people who 
1SA.14.18	Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For the ark of God was at that time with the sons of Israel. 
1SA.14.19	While Saul talked to the priest, the commotion in the camp of the Philistines continued and increased; so Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.” 
1SA.14.20	Then Saul and all the people who 
1SA.14.21	Now the Hebrews 
1SA.14.22	When all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, even they also pursued them closely in the battle. 
1SA.14.23	So the L
1SA.14.24	Now the men of Israel were hard-pressed on that day, for Saul had put the people under oath, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats food before evening, and until I have avenged myself on my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food. 
1SA.14.25	All 
1SA.14.26	When the people entered the forest, behold, 
1SA.14.27	But Jonathan had not heard when his father put the people under oath; therefore, he put out the end of the staff that 
1SA.14.28	Then one of the people said, “Your father strictly put the people under oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food today.’ ” And the people were weary. 
1SA.14.29	Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. See now, how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey. 
1SA.14.30	How much more, if only the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found! For now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great.”
1SA.14.31	They struck among the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very weary. 
1SA.14.32	The people rushed greedily upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen and calves, and slew 
1SA.14.33	Then they told Saul, saying, “Behold, the people are sinning against the L
1SA.14.34	Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, ‘Each one of you bring me his ox or his sheep, and slaughter 
1SA.14.35	And Saul built an altar to the L
1SA.14.36	Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” So the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.” 
1SA.14.37	Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You give them into the hand of Israel?” But He did not answer him on that day. 
1SA.14.38	Saul said, “Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people, and investigate and see how this sin has happened today. 
1SA.14.39	For as the L
1SA.14.40	Then he said to all Israel, “You shall be on one side and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.” 
1SA.14.41	Therefore, Saul said to the L
1SA.14.42	Saul said, “Cast 
1SA.14.43	Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” So Jonathan told him and said, “I indeed tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am, I must die!” 
1SA.14.44	Saul said, “May God do this 
1SA.14.45	But the people said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die, who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Far from it! As the L
1SA.14.46	Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.
1SA.14.47	Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, the sons of Ammon, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines; and wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment. 
1SA.14.48	He acted valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of those who plundered them.
1SA.14.49	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishvi and Malchi-shua; and the names of his two daughters 
1SA.14.50	The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle. 
1SA.14.51	Kish 
1SA.14.52	Now the war against the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man or any valiant man, he attached him to his staff.
1SA.15.1	Then Samuel said to Saul, “The L
1SA.15.2	Thus says the L
1SA.15.3	Now go and strike Amalek and utterly destroy all that he has, and do not spare him; but put to death both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’ ”
1SA.15.4	Then Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim, 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah. 
1SA.15.5	Saul came to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the valley. 
1SA.15.6	Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, so that I do not destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the sons of Israel when they came up from Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 
1SA.15.7	So Saul defeated the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, which is east of Egypt. 
1SA.15.8	He captured Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 
1SA.15.9	But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good, and were not willing to destroy them utterly; but everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed.
1SA.15.10	Then the word of the L
1SA.15.11	“I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me and has not carried out My commands.” And Samuel was distressed and cried out to the L
1SA.15.12	Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul; and it was told Samuel, saying, “Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, then turned and proceeded on down to Gilgal.” 
1SA.15.13	Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, “Blessed are you of the L
1SA.15.14	But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?” 
1SA.15.15	Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen, to sacrifice to the L
1SA.15.16	Then Samuel said to Saul, “Wait, and let me tell you what the L
1SA.15.17	Samuel said, “Is it not true, though you were little in your own eyes, you were 
1SA.15.18	and the L
1SA.15.19	Why then did you not obey the voice of the L
1SA.15.20	Then Saul said to Samuel, “I did obey the voice of the L
1SA.15.21	But the people took

1SA.15.22	“Has the L
1SA.15.22	As in obeying the voice of the L
1SA.15.22	Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,
1SA.15.23	For rebellion is as the sin of divination,
1SA.15.23	And insubordination is as iniquity and idolatry.
1SA.15.23	Because you have rejected the word of the L
1SA.15.23	He has also rejected you from 
1SA.15.24	Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; I have indeed transgressed the command of the L
1SA.15.25	Now therefore, please pardon my sin and return with me, that I may worship the L
1SA.15.26	But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the L
1SA.15.27	As Samuel turned to go, 
1SA.15.28	So Samuel said to him, “The L
1SA.15.29	Also the Glory of Israel will not lie or change His mind; for He is not a man that He should change His mind.” 
1SA.15.30	Then he said, “I have sinned; 
1SA.15.31	So Samuel went back following Saul, and Saul worshiped the L
1SA.15.32	Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag, the king of the Amalekites.” And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.” 
1SA.15.33	But Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.” And Samuel hewed Agag to pieces before the L
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul. 
1SA.15.35	Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death; for Samuel grieved over Saul. And the L
1SA.16.1	Now the L
1SA.16.2	But Samuel said, “How can I go? When Saul hears 
1SA.16.3	You shall invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for Me the one whom I designate to you.” 
1SA.16.4	So Samuel did what the L
1SA.16.5	He said, “In peace; I have come to sacrifice to the L
1SA.16.6	When they entered, he looked at Eliab and thought, “Surely the L
1SA.16.7	But the L

1SA.16.9	Next Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “The L
1SA.16.10	Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “The L
1SA.16.11	And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are these all the children?” And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is tending the sheep.” Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.”
1SA.16.12	So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. And the L
1SA.16.13	Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the L
1SA.16.14	Now the Spirit of the L
1SA.16.15	Saul’s servants then said to him, “Behold now, an evil spirit from God is terrorizing you. 
1SA.16.16	Let our lord now command your servants who are before you. Let them seek a man who is a skillful player on the harp; and it shall come about when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play 
1SA.16.17	So Saul said to his servants, “Provide for me now a man who can play well and bring 
1SA.16.18	Then one of the young men said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is a skillful musician, a mighty man of valor, a warrior, one prudent in speech, and a handsome man; and the L
1SA.16.19	So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David who is with the flock.” 
1SA.16.20	Jesse took a donkey 
1SA.16.21	Then David came to Saul and attended him; and Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor bearer. 
1SA.16.22	Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Let David now stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.” 
1SA.16.23	So it came about whenever the 
1SA.17.1	Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle; and they were gathered at Socoh which belongs to Judah, and they camped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. 
1SA.17.2	Saul and the men of Israel were gathered and camped in the valley of Elah, and drew up in battle array to encounter the Philistines. 
1SA.17.3	The Philistines stood on the mountain on one side while Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them. 
1SA.17.4	Then a champion came out from the armies of the Philistines named Goliath, from Gath, whose height was six 
1SA.17.5	 a bronze helmet on his head, and he was clothed with scale-armor which weighed five thousand shekels of bronze. 
1SA.17.6	 also 
1SA.17.7	The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and the head of his spear 
1SA.17.8	He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel and said to them, “Why do you come out to draw up in battle array? Am I not the Philistine and you servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me. 
1SA.17.9	If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will become your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall become our servants and serve us.” 
1SA.17.10	Again the Philistine said, “I defy the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man that we may fight together.” 
1SA.17.11	When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
1SA.17.12	Now David was the son of the Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse, and he had eight sons. And Jesse was old in the days of Saul, advanced 
1SA.17.13	The three older sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and the second to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. 
1SA.17.14	David was the youngest. Now the three oldest followed Saul, 
1SA.17.15	but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s flock at Bethlehem. 
1SA.17.16	The Philistine came forward morning and evening for forty days and took his stand.
1SA.17.17	Then Jesse said to David his son, “Take now for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves and run to the camp to your brothers. 
1SA.17.18	Bring also these ten cuts of cheese to the commander of 
1SA.17.19	For Saul and they and all the men of Israel are in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.”
1SA.17.20	So David arose early in the morning and left the flock with a keeper and took 
1SA.17.21	Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle array, army against army. 
1SA.17.22	Then David left his baggage in the care of the baggage keeper, and ran to the battle line and entered in order to greet his brothers. 
1SA.17.23	As he was talking with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine from Gath named Goliath, was coming up from the army of the Philistines, and he spoke these same words; and David heard 
1SA.17.24	When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from him and were greatly afraid. 
1SA.17.25	The men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who is coming up? Surely he is coming up to defy Israel. And it will be that the king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father’s house 
1SA.17.26	Then David spoke to the men who were standing by him, saying, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should taunt the armies of the living God?” 
1SA.17.27	The people answered him in accord with this word, saying, “Thus it will be done for the man who kills him.”
1SA.17.28	Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger burned against David and he said, “Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your insolence and the wickedness of your heart; for you have come down in order to see the battle.” 
1SA.17.29	But David said, “What have I done now? Was it not just a question?” 
1SA.17.30	Then he turned away from him to another and said the same thing; and the people answered the same thing as before.
1SA.17.31	When the words which David spoke were heard, they told 
1SA.17.32	David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail on account of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” 
1SA.17.33	Then Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are 
1SA.17.34	But David said to Saul, “Your servant was tending his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock, 
1SA.17.35	I went out after him and attacked him, and rescued 
1SA.17.36	Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has taunted the armies of the living God.” 
1SA.17.37	And David said, “The L
1SA.17.38	Then Saul clothed David with his garments and put a bronze helmet on his head, and he clothed him with armor. 
1SA.17.39	David girded his sword over his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested 
1SA.17.40	He took his stick in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in the shepherd’s bag which he had, even in 
1SA.17.41	Then the Philistine came on and approached David, with the shield-bearer in front of him. 
1SA.17.42	When the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him; for he was 
1SA.17.43	The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
1SA.17.44	The Philistine also said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field.” 
1SA.17.45	Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the L
1SA.17.46	This day the L
1SA.17.47	and that all this assembly may know that the L
1SA.17.48	Then it happened when the Philistine rose and came and drew near to meet David, that David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. 
1SA.17.49	And David put his hand into his bag and took from it a stone and slung 
1SA.17.50	Thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and he struck the Philistine and killed him; but there was no sword in David’s hand. 
1SA.17.51	Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. 
1SA.17.52	The men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philistines as far as the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the slain Philistines lay along the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath and Ekron. 
1SA.17.53	The sons of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines and plundered their camps. 
1SA.17.54	Then David took the Philistine’s head and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent.
1SA.17.55	Now when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this young man?” And Abner said, “By your life, O king, I do not know.” 
1SA.17.56	The king said, “You inquire whose son the youth is.” 
1SA.17.57	So when David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the Philistine’s head in his hand. 
1SA.17.58	Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David answered, “
1SA.18.1	Now it came about when he had finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as himself. 
1SA.18.2	Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father’s house. 
1SA.18.3	Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. 
1SA.18.4	Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his armor, including his sword and his bow and his belt. 
1SA.18.5	So David went out wherever Saul sent him, 
1SA.18.6	It happened as they were coming, when David returned from killing the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy and with 
1SA.18.7	The women sang as they played, and said,
1SA.18.7	“Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.18.7	And David his ten thousands.”
1SA.18.8	Then Saul became very angry, for this saying displeased him; and he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, but to me they have ascribed thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?” 
1SA.18.9	Saul looked at David with suspicion from that day on.
1SA.18.10	Now it came about on the next day that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house, while David was playing 
1SA.18.11	Saul hurled the spear for he thought, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David escaped from his presence twice.
1SA.18.12	Now Saul was afraid of David, for the L
1SA.18.13	Therefore Saul removed him from his presence and appointed him as his commander of a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. 
1SA.18.14	David was prospering in all his ways for the L
1SA.18.15	When Saul saw that he was prospering greatly, he dreaded him. 
1SA.18.16	But all Israel and Judah loved David, and he went out and came in before them.
1SA.18.17	Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife, only be a valiant man for me and fight the L
1SA.18.18	But David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life 
1SA.18.19	So it came about at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife.
1SA.18.20	Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David. When they told Saul, the thing was agreeable to him. 
1SA.18.21	Saul thought, “I will give her to him that she may become a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David, “For a second time you may be my son-in-law today.” 
1SA.18.22	Then Saul commanded his servants, “Speak to David secretly, saying, ‘Behold, the king delights in you, and all his servants love you; now therefore, become the king’s son-in-law.’ ” 
1SA.18.23	So Saul’s servants spoke these words to David. But David said, “Is it trivial in your sight to become the king’s son-in-law, since I am a poor man and lightly esteemed?” 
1SA.18.24	The servants of Saul reported to him according to these words 
1SA.18.25	Saul then said, “Thus you shall say to David, ‘The king does not desire any dowry except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king’s enemies.’ ” Now Saul planned to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 
1SA.18.26	When his servants told David these words, it pleased David to become the king’s son-in-law. Before the days had expired 
1SA.18.27	David rose up and went, he and his men, and struck down two hundred men among the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might become the king’s son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal his daughter for a wife. 
1SA.18.28	When Saul saw and knew that the L
1SA.18.29	then Saul was even more afraid of David. Thus Saul was David’s enemy continually.
1SA.18.30	Then the commanders of the Philistines went out 
1SA.19.1	Now Saul told Jonathan his son and all his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, greatly delighted in David. 
1SA.19.2	So Jonathan told David saying, “Saul my father is seeking to put you to death. Now therefore, please be on guard in the morning, and stay in a secret place and hide yourself. 
1SA.19.3	I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with my father about you; if I find out anything, then I will tell you.” 
1SA.19.4	Then Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, “Do not let the king sin against his servant David, since he has not sinned against you, and since his deeds 
1SA.19.5	For he took his life in his hand and struck the Philistine, and the L
1SA.19.6	Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul vowed, “As the L
1SA.19.7	Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these words. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as formerly.
1SA.19.8	When there was war again, David went out and fought with the Philistines and defeated them with great slaughter, so that they fled before him. 
1SA.19.9	Now there was an evil spirit from the L
1SA.19.10	Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, so that he stuck the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night.
1SA.19.11	Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him, in order to put him to death in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be put to death.” 
1SA.19.12	So Michal let David down through a window, and he went out and fled and escaped. 
1SA.19.13	Michal took the household idol and laid 
1SA.19.14	When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.” 
1SA.19.15	Then Saul sent messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me on his bed, that I may put him to death.” 
1SA.19.16	When the messengers entered, behold, the household idol 
1SA.19.17	So Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” And Michal said to Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I put you to death?’ ”
1SA.19.18	Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth. 
1SA.19.19	It was told Saul, saying, “Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.” 
1SA.19.20	Then Saul sent messengers to take David, but when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing 
1SA.19.21	When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. So Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.22	Then he himself went to Ramah and came as far as the large well that is in Secu; and he asked and said, “Where are Samuel and David?” And 
1SA.19.23	He proceeded there to Naioth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also, so that he went along prophesying continually until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 
1SA.19.24	He also stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”
1SA.20.1	Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said to Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my iniquity? And what is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?” 
1SA.20.2	He said to him, “Far from it, you shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me. So why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!” 
1SA.20.3	Yet David vowed again, saying, “Your father knows well that I have found favor in your sight, and he has said, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, or he will be grieved.’ But truly as the L
1SA.20.4	Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.” 
1SA.20.5	So David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I ought to sit down to eat with the king. But let me go, that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening. 
1SA.20.6	If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked 
1SA.20.7	If he says, ‘It is good,’ your servant 
1SA.20.8	Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the L
1SA.20.9	Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! For if I should indeed learn that evil has been decided by my father to come upon you, then would I not tell you about it?” 
1SA.20.10	Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?” 
1SA.20.11	Jonathan said to David, “Come, and let us go out into the field.” So both of them went out to the field.
1SA.20.12	Then Jonathan said to David, “The L
1SA.20.13	If it please my father 
1SA.20.14	If I am still alive, will you not show me the lovingkindness of the L
1SA.20.15	You shall not cut off your lovingkindness from my house forever, not even when the L
1SA.20.16	So Jonathan made a 
1SA.20.17	Jonathan made David vow again because of his love for him, because he loved him as he loved his own life.
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed because your seat will be empty. 
1SA.20.19	When you have stayed for three days, you shall go down quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself on that eventful day, and you shall remain by the stone Ezel. 
1SA.20.20	I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a target. 
1SA.20.21	And behold, I will send the lad, 
1SA.20.22	But if I say to the youth, ‘Behold, the arrows are beyond you,’ go, for the L
1SA.20.23	As for the agreement of which you and I have spoken, behold, the L
1SA.20.24	So David hid in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food. 
1SA.20.25	The king sat on his seat as usual, the seat by the wall; then Jonathan rose up and Abner sat down by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty. 
1SA.20.26	Nevertheless Saul did not speak anything that day, for he thought, “It is an accident, he is not clean, surely 
1SA.20.27	It came about the next day, the second 
1SA.20.28	Jonathan then answered Saul, “David earnestly asked leave of me 
1SA.20.29	for he said, ‘Please let me go, since our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to attend. And now, if I have found favor in your sight, please let me get away that I may see my brothers.’ For this reason he has not come to the king’s table.”
1SA.20.30	Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan and he said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you are choosing the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness? 
1SA.20.31	For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Therefore now, send and bring him to me, for he must surely die.” 
1SA.20.32	But Jonathan answered Saul his father and said to him, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” 
1SA.20.33	Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him down; so Jonathan knew that his father had decided to put David to death. 
1SA.20.34	Then Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved over David because his father had dishonored him.
1SA.20.35	Now it came about in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field for the appointment with David, and a little lad 
1SA.20.36	He said to his lad, “Run, find now the arrows which I am about to shoot.” As the lad was running, he shot an arrow past him. 
1SA.20.37	When the lad reached the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the lad and said, “Is not the arrow beyond you?” 
1SA.20.38	And Jonathan called after the lad, “Hurry, be quick, do not stay!” And Jonathan’s lad picked up the arrow and came to his master. 
1SA.20.39	But the lad was not aware of anything; only Jonathan and David knew about the matter. 
1SA.20.40	Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad and said to him, “Go, bring 
1SA.20.41	When the lad was gone, David rose from the south side and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed three times. And they kissed each other and wept together, but David 
1SA.20.42	Jonathan said to David, “Go in safety, inasmuch as we have sworn to each other in the name of the L
1SA.21.1	Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech came trembling to meet David and said to him, “Why are you alone and no one with you?” 
1SA.21.2	David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commissioned me with a matter and has said to me, ‘Let no one know anything about the matter on which I am sending you and with which I have commissioned you; and I have directed the young men to a certain place.’ 
1SA.21.3	Now therefore, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.” 
1SA.21.4	The priest answered David and said, “There is no ordinary bread on hand, but there is consecrated bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.” 
1SA.21.5	David answered the priest and said to him, “Surely women have been kept from us as previously when I set out and the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was an ordinary journey; how much more then today will their vessels 
1SA.21.6	So the priest gave him consecrated 
1SA.21.7	Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the L
1SA.21.8	David said to Ahimelech, “Now is there not a spear or a sword on hand? For I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s matter was urgent.” 
1SA.21.9	Then the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you would take it for yourself, take 
1SA.21.10	Then David arose and fled that day from Saul, and went to Achish king of Gath. 
1SA.21.11	But the servants of Achish said to him, “Is this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing of this one as they danced, saying,
1SA.21.11	‘Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.21.11	And David his ten thousands’?”
1SA.21.12	David took these words to heart and greatly feared Achish king of Gath. 
1SA.21.13	So he disguised his sanity before them, and acted insanely in their hands, and scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his saliva run down into his beard. 
1SA.21.14	Then Achish said to his servants, “Behold, you see the man behaving as a madman. Why do you bring him to me? 
1SA.21.15	Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this one to act the madman in my presence? Shall this one come into my house?”
1SA.22.1	So David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam; and when his brothers and all his father’s household heard 
1SA.22.2	Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him; and he became captain over them. Now there were about four hundred men with him.
1SA.22.3	And David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother come 
1SA.22.4	Then he left them with the king of Moab; and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold. 
1SA.22.5	The prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah.” So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth.
1SA.22.6	Then Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been discovered. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree on the height with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him. 
1SA.22.7	Saul said to his servants who stood around him, “Hear now, O Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse also give to all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds? 
1SA.22.8	For all of you have conspired against me so that there is no one who discloses to me when my son makes 
1SA.22.9	Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing by the servants of Saul, said, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 
1SA.22.10	He inquired of the L
1SA.22.11	Then the king sent someone to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s household, the priests who were in Nob; and all of them came to the king. 
1SA.22.12	Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.” And he answered, “Here I am, my lord.” 
1SA.22.13	Saul then said to him, “Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so that he would rise up against me by lying in ambush as 
1SA.22.14	Then Ahimelech answered the king and said, “And who among all your servants is as faithful as David, even the king’s son-in-law, who is captain over your guard, and is honored in your house? 
1SA.22.15	Did I 
1SA.22.16	But the king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s household!” 
1SA.22.17	And the king said to the guards who were attending him, “Turn around and put the priests of the L
1SA.22.18	Then the king said to Doeg, “You turn around and attack the priests.” And Doeg the Edomite turned around and attacked the priests, and he killed that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod. 
1SA.22.19	And he struck Nob the city of the priests with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and infants; also oxen, donkeys, and sheep 
1SA.22.20	But one son of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David. 
1SA.22.21	Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the L
1SA.22.22	Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have brought about 
1SA.22.23	Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life, for you are safe with me.”
1SA.23.1	Then they told David, saying, “Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are plundering the threshing floors.” 
1SA.23.2	So David inquired of the L
1SA.23.3	But David’s men said to him, “Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the ranks of the Philistines?” 
1SA.23.4	Then David inquired of the L
1SA.23.5	So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines; and he led away their livestock and struck them with a great slaughter. Thus David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah.
1SA.23.6	Now it came about, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, 
1SA.23.7	When it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hand, for he shut himself in by entering a city with double gates and bars.” 
1SA.23.8	So Saul summoned all the people for war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men. 
1SA.23.9	Now David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him; so he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.” 
1SA.23.10	Then David said, “O L
1SA.23.11	Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down just as Your servant has heard? O L
1SA.23.12	Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And the L
1SA.23.13	Then David and his men, about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. When it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the pursuit. 
1SA.23.14	David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand.
1SA.23.15	Now David became aware that Saul had come out to seek his life while David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh. 
1SA.23.16	And Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose and went to David at Horesh, and 
1SA.23.17	Thus he said to him, “Do not be afraid, because the hand of Saul my father will not find you, and you will be king over Israel and I will be next to you; and Saul my father knows that also.” 
1SA.23.18	So the two of them made a covenant before the L
1SA.23.19	Then Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is David not hiding with us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of 
1SA.23.20	Now then, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to do so; and our part 
1SA.23.21	Saul said, “May you be blessed of the L
1SA.23.22	Go now, make more sure, and investigate and see his place where his haunt is, 
1SA.23.23	So look, and learn about all the hiding places where he hides himself and return to me with certainty, and I will go with you; and if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.”
1SA.23.24	Then they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon. 
1SA.23.25	When Saul and his men went to seek 
1SA.23.26	Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain; and David was hurrying to get away from Saul, for Saul and his men were surrounding David and his men to seize them. 
1SA.23.27	But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, for the Philistines have made a raid on the land.” 
1SA.23.28	So Saul returned from pursuing David and went to meet the Philistines; therefore they called that place the Rock of Escape. 
1SA.23.29	David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of Engedi.
1SA.24.1	Now when Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, saying, “Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.” 
1SA.24.2	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the Rocks of the Wild Goats. 
1SA.24.3	He came to the sheepfolds on the way, where there 
1SA.24.4	The men of David said to him, “Behold, 
1SA.24.5	It came about afterward that David’s conscience bothered him because he had cut off the edge of Saul’s 
1SA.24.6	So he said to his men, “Far be it from me because of the L
1SA.24.7	David persuaded his men with 
1SA.24.8	Now afterward David arose and went out of the cave and called after Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the ground and prostrated himself. 
1SA.24.9	David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of men, saying, ‘Behold, David seeks to harm you’? 
1SA.24.10	Behold, this day your eyes have seen that the L
1SA.24.11	Now, my father, see! Indeed, see the edge of your robe in my hand! For in that I cut off the edge of your robe and did not kill you, know and perceive that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands, and I have not sinned against you, though you are lying in wait for my life to take it. 
1SA.24.12	May the L
1SA.24.13	As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness’; but my hand shall not be against you. 
1SA.24.14	After whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog, a single flea? 
1SA.24.15	The L
1SA.24.16	When David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” Then Saul lifted up his voice and wept. 
1SA.24.17	He said to David, “You are more righteous than I; for you have dealt well with me, while I have dealt wickedly with you. 
1SA.24.18	You have declared today that you have done good to me, that the L
1SA.24.19	For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safely? May the L
1SA.24.20	Now, behold, I know that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand. 
1SA.24.21	So now swear to me by the L
1SA.24.22	David swore to Saul. And Saul went to his home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
1SA.25.1	Then Samuel died; and all Israel gathered together and mourned for him, and buried him at his house in Ramah. And David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
1SA.25.2	Now 
1SA.25.3	(now the man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. And the woman was intelligent and beautiful in appearance, but the man was harsh and evil in 
1SA.25.4	that David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 
1SA.25.5	So David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, visit Nabal and greet him in my name; 
1SA.25.6	and thus you shall say, ‘Have a long life, peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have. 
1SA.25.7	Now I have heard that you have shearers; now your shepherds have been with us and we have not insulted them, nor have they missed anything all the days they were in Carmel. 
1SA.25.8	Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore let 
1SA.25.9	When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in David’s name; then they waited. 
1SA.25.10	But Nabal answered David’s servants and said, “Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants today who are each breaking away from his master. 
1SA.25.11	Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men whose origin I do not know?” 
1SA.25.12	So David’s young men retraced their way and went back; and they came and told him according to all these words. 
1SA.25.13	David said to his men, “Each 
1SA.25.14	But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Behold, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, and he scorned them. 
1SA.25.15	Yet the men were very good to us, and we were not insulted, nor did we miss anything as long as we went about with them, while we were in the fields. 
1SA.25.16	They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the time we were with them tending the sheep. 
1SA.25.17	Now therefore, know and consider what you should do, for evil is plotted against our master and against all his household; and he is such a worthless man that no one can speak to him.”
1SA.25.18	Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred 
1SA.25.19	She said to her young men, “Go on before me; behold, I am coming after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal. 
1SA.25.20	It came about as she was riding on her donkey and coming down by the hidden part of the mountain, that behold, David and his men were coming down toward her; so she met them. 
1SA.25.21	Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have guarded all that this 
1SA.25.22	May God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if by morning I leave 
1SA.25.23	When Abigail saw David, she hurried and dismounted from her donkey, and fell on her face before David and bowed herself to the ground. 
1SA.25.24	She fell at his feet and said, “On me alone, my lord, be the blame. And please let your maidservant speak to you, and listen to the words of your maidservant. 
1SA.25.25	Please do not let my lord pay attention to this worthless man, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name and folly is with him; but I your maidservant did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent.
1SA.25.26	“Now therefore, my lord, as the L
1SA.25.27	Now let this gift which your maidservant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who accompany my lord. 
1SA.25.28	Please forgive the transgression of your maidservant; for the L
1SA.25.29	Should anyone rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, then the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the L
1SA.25.30	And when the L
1SA.25.31	this will not cause grief or a troubled heart to my lord, both by having shed blood without cause and by my lord having avenged himself. When the L
1SA.25.32	Then David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the L
1SA.25.33	and blessed be your discernment, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand. 
1SA.25.34	Nevertheless, as the L
1SA.25.35	So David received from her hand what she had brought him and said to her, “Go up to your house in peace. See, I have listened to you and granted your request.”
1SA.25.36	Then Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk; so she did not tell him anything at all until the morning light. 
1SA.25.37	But in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him so that he became 
1SA.25.38	About ten days later, the L
1SA.25.39	When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the L
1SA.25.40	When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you to take you as his wife.” 
1SA.25.41	She arose and bowed with her face to the ground and said, “Behold, your maidservant is a maid to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.” 
1SA.25.42	Then Abigail quickly arose, and rode on a donkey, with her five maidens who attended her; and she followed the messengers of David and became his wife.
1SA.25.43	David had also taken Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives.
1SA.25.44	Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
1SA.26.1	Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding on the hill of Hachilah, 
1SA.26.2	So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having with him three thousand chosen men of Israel, to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph. 
1SA.26.3	Saul camped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before 
1SA.26.4	David sent out spies, and he knew that Saul was definitely coming. 
1SA.26.5	David then arose and came to the place where Saul had camped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army; and Saul was lying in the circle of the camp, and the people were camped around him.
1SA.26.6	Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.” 
1SA.26.7	So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul lay sleeping inside the circle of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people were lying around him. 
1SA.26.8	Then Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hand; now therefore, please let me strike him with the spear to the ground with one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time.” 
1SA.26.9	But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him, for who can stretch out his hand against the L
1SA.26.10	David also said, “As the L
1SA.26.11	The L
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and the jug of water from 
1SA.26.13	Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the mountain at a distance 
1SA.26.14	David called to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Will you not answer, Abner?” Then Abner replied, “Who are you who calls to the king?” 
1SA.26.15	So David said to Abner, “Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy the king your lord. 
1SA.26.16	This thing that you have done is not good. As the L
1SA.26.17	Then Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And David said, “It is my voice, my lord the king.” 
1SA.26.18	He also said, “Why then is my lord pursuing his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand? 
1SA.26.19	Now therefore, please let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant. If the L
1SA.26.20	Now then, do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of the L
1SA.26.21	Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will not harm you again because my life was precious in your sight this day. Behold, I have played the fool and have committed a serious error.” 
1SA.26.22	David replied, “Behold the spear of the king! Now let one of the young men come over and take it. 
1SA.26.23	The L
1SA.26.24	Now behold, as your life was highly valued in my sight this day, so may my life be highly valued in the sight of the L
1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to David, “Blessed are you, my son David; you will both accomplish much and surely prevail.” So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
1SA.27.1	Then David said to himself, “Now I will perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than to escape into the land of the Philistines. Saul then will despair of searching for me anymore in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand.” 
1SA.27.2	So David arose and crossed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. 
1SA.27.3	And David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each with his household, 
1SA.27.4	Now it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, so he no longer searched for him.
1SA.27.5	Then David said to Achish, “If now I have found favor in your sight, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may live there; for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?” 
1SA.27.6	So Achish gave him Ziklag that day; therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day. 
1SA.27.7	The number of days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.
1SA.27.8	Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites; for they were the inhabitants of the land from ancient times, as you come to Shur even as far as the land of Egypt. 
1SA.27.9	David attacked the land and did not leave a man or a woman alive, and he took away the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned and came to Achish. 
1SA.27.10	Now Achish said, “Where have you made a raid today?” And David said, “Against the 
1SA.27.11	David did not leave a man or a woman alive to bring to Gath, saying, “Otherwise they will tell about us, saying, ‘So has David done and so 
1SA.27.12	So Achish believed David, saying, “He has surely made himself odious among his people Israel; therefore he will become my servant forever.”
1SA.28.1	Now it came about in those days that the Philistines gathered their armed camps for war, to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, “Know assuredly that you will go out with me in the camp, you and your men.” 
1SA.28.2	David said to Achish, “Very well, you shall know what your servant can do.” So Achish said to David, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.”
1SA.28.3	Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had removed from the land those who were mediums and spiritists. 
1SA.28.4	So the Philistines gathered together and came and camped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together and they camped in Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	When Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly. 
1SA.28.6	When Saul inquired of the L
1SA.28.7	Then Saul said to his servants, “Seek for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.” And his servants said to him, “Behold, there is a woman who is a medium at En-dor.”
1SA.28.8	Then Saul disguised himself by putting on other clothes, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night; and he said, “Conjure up for me, please, and bring up for me whom I shall name to you.” 
1SA.28.9	But the woman said to him, “Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who are mediums and spiritists from the land. Why are you then laying a snare for my life to bring about my death?” 
1SA.28.10	Saul vowed to her by the L
1SA.28.11	Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” And he said, “Bring up Samuel for me.” 
1SA.28.12	When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, “Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul.” 
1SA.28.13	The king said to her, “Do not be afraid; but what do you see?” And the woman said to Saul, “I see a divine being coming up out of the earth.” 
1SA.28.14	He said to her, “What is his form?” And she said, “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped with a robe.” And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and did homage.
1SA.28.15	Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” And Saul answered, “I am greatly distressed; for the Philistines are waging war against me, and God has departed from me and no longer answers me, either through prophets or by dreams; therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I should do.” 
1SA.28.16	Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since the L
1SA.28.17	The L
1SA.28.18	As you did not obey the L
1SA.28.19	Moreover the L
1SA.28.20	Then Saul immediately fell full length upon the ground and was very afraid because of the words of Samuel; also there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no food all day and all night. 
1SA.28.21	The woman came to Saul and saw that he was terrified, and said to him, “Behold, your maidservant has obeyed you, and I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to your words which you spoke to me. 
1SA.28.22	So now also, please listen to the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a piece of bread before you that 
1SA.28.23	But he refused and said, “I will not eat.” However, his servants together with the woman urged him, and he listened to them. So he arose from the ground and sat on the bed. 
1SA.28.24	The woman had a fattened calf in the house, and she quickly slaughtered it; and she took flour, kneaded it and baked unleavened bread from it. 
1SA.28.25	She brought 
1SA.29.1	Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek, while the Israelites were camping by the spring which is in Jezreel. 
1SA.29.2	And the lords of the Philistines were proceeding on by hundreds and by thousands, and David and his men were proceeding on in the rear with Achish. 
1SA.29.3	Then the commanders of the Philistines said, “What 
1SA.29.4	But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him, and the commanders of the Philistines said to him, “Make the man go back, that he may return to his place where you have assigned him, and do not let him go down to battle with us, or in the battle he may become an adversary to us. For with what could this 
1SA.29.5	Is this not David, of whom they sing in the dances, saying,
1SA.29.5	‘Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.29.5	And David his ten thousands’?”
1SA.29.6	Then Achish called David and said to him, “
1SA.29.7	Now therefore return and go in peace, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines.” 
1SA.29.8	David said to Achish, “But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant from the day when I came before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?” 
1SA.29.9	But Achish replied to David, “I know that you are pleasing in my sight, like an angel of God; nevertheless the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go up with us to the battle.’ 
1SA.29.10	Now then arise early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you, and as soon as you have arisen early in the morning and have light, depart.” 
1SA.29.11	So David arose early, he and his men, to depart in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
1SA.30.1	Then it happened when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev and on Ziklag, and had overthrown Ziklag and burned it with fire; 
1SA.30.2	and they took captive the women 
1SA.30.3	When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire, and their wives and their sons and their daughters had been taken captive. 
1SA.30.4	Then David and the people who were with him lifted their voices and wept until there was no strength in them to weep. 
1SA.30.5	Now David’s two wives had been taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. 
1SA.30.6	Moreover David was greatly distressed because the people spoke of stoning him, for all the people were embittered, each one because of his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in the L
1SA.30.7	Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring me the ephod.” So Abiathar brought the ephod to David. 
1SA.30.8	David inquired of the L
1SA.30.9	So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, 
1SA.30.10	But David pursued, he and four hundred men, for two hundred who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor remained 
1SA.30.11	Now they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David, and gave him bread and he ate, and they provided him water to drink. 
1SA.30.12	They gave him a piece of fig cake and two clusters of raisins, and he ate; then his spirit revived. For he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights. 
1SA.30.13	David said to him, “To whom do you belong? And where are you from?” And he said, “I am a young man of Egypt, a servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me behind when I fell sick three days ago. 
1SA.30.14	We made a raid on the Negev of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.” 
1SA.30.15	Then David said to him, “Will you bring me down to this band?” And he said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this band.”
1SA.30.16	When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. 
1SA.30.17	David slaughtered them from the twilight until the evening of the next day; and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled. 
1SA.30.18	So David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and rescued his two wives. 
1SA.30.19	But nothing of theirs was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that they had taken for themselves; David brought 
1SA.30.20	So David had captured all the sheep and the cattle 
1SA.30.21	When David came to the two hundred men who were too exhausted to follow David, who had also been left at the brook Besor, and they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him, then David approached the people and greeted them. 
1SA.30.22	Then all the wicked and worthless men among those who went with David said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead 
1SA.30.23	Then David said, “You must not do so, my brothers, with what the L
1SA.30.24	And who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage; they shall share alike.” 
1SA.30.25	So it has been from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
1SA.30.26	Now when David came to Ziklag, he sent 
1SA.30.27	to those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the Negev, and to those who were in Jattir, 
1SA.30.28	and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa, 
1SA.30.29	and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites, 
1SA.30.30	and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Bor-ashan, and to those who were in Athach, 
1SA.30.31	and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were accustomed to go.”
1SA.31.1	Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.2	The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua the sons of Saul. 
1SA.31.3	The battle went heavily against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was badly wounded by the archers. 
1SA.31.4	Then Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and pierce me through with it, otherwise these uncircumcised will come and pierce me through and make sport of me.” But his armor bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. So Saul took his sword and fell on it. 
1SA.31.5	When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died with him. 
1SA.31.6	Thus Saul died with his three sons, his armor bearer, and all his men on that day together.
1SA.31.7	When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, with those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled; then the Philistines came and lived in them.
1SA.31.8	It came about on the next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.9	They cut off his head and stripped off his weapons, and sent 
1SA.31.10	They put his weapons in the temple of Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. 
1SA.31.11	Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1SA.31.12	all the valiant men rose and walked all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and they came to Jabesh and burned them there. 
1SA.31.13	They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
2SA.1.1	Now it came about after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, that David remained two days in Ziklag. 
2SA.1.2	On the third day, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn and dust on his head. And it came about when he came to David that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself. 
2SA.1.3	Then David said to him, “From where do you come?” And he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.” 
2SA.1.4	David said to him, “How did things go? Please tell me.” And he said, “The people have fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.” 
2SA.1.5	So David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” 
2SA.1.6	The young man who told him said, “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul was leaning on his spear. And behold, the chariots and the horsemen pursued him closely. 
2SA.1.7	When he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I said, ‘Here I am.’ 
2SA.1.8	He said to me, ‘Who are you?’ And I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ 
2SA.1.9	Then he said to me, ‘Please stand beside me and kill me, for agony has seized me because my life still lingers in me.’ 
2SA.1.10	So I stood beside him and killed him, because I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown which 
2SA.1.11	Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and 
2SA.1.12	They mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan and for the people of the L
2SA.1.13	David said to the young man who told him, “Where are you from?” And he answered, “I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite.” 
2SA.1.14	Then David said to him, “How is it you were not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy the L
2SA.1.15	And David called one of the young men and said, “Go, cut him down.” So he struck him and he died. 
2SA.1.16	David said to him, “Your blood is on your head, for your mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the L
2SA.1.17	Then David chanted with this lament over Saul and Jonathan his son, 
2SA.1.18	and he told 
2SA.1.19	“Your beauty, O Israel, is slain on your high places!
2SA.1.19	How have the mighty fallen!
2SA.1.20	Tell 
2SA.1.20	Proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon,
2SA.1.20	Or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice,
2SA.1.20	The daughters of the uncircumcised will exult.
2SA.1.21	O mountains of Gilboa,
2SA.1.21	Let not dew or rain be on you, nor fields of offerings;
2SA.1.21	For there the shield of the mighty was defiled,
2SA.1.21	The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
2SA.1.22	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,
2SA.1.22	The bow of Jonathan did not turn back,
2SA.1.22	And the sword of Saul did not return empty.
2SA.1.23	Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in their life,
2SA.1.23	And in their death they were not parted;
2SA.1.23	They were swifter than eagles,
2SA.1.23	They were stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
2SA.1.24	Who clothed you luxuriously in scarlet,
2SA.1.24	Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.
2SA.1.25	How have the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!
2SA.1.25	Jonathan is slain on your high places.
2SA.1.26	I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan;
2SA.1.26	You have been very pleasant to me.
2SA.1.26	Your love to me was more wonderful
2SA.1.26	Than the love of women.
2SA.1.27	How have the mighty fallen,
2SA.1.27	And the weapons of war perished!”
2SA.2.1	Then it came about afterwards that David inquired of the L
2SA.2.2	So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. 
2SA.2.3	And David brought up his men who 
2SA.2.4	Then the men of Judah came and there anointed David king over the house of Judah.
2SA.2.5	David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, “May you be blessed of the L
2SA.2.6	Now may the L
2SA.2.7	Now therefore, let your hands be strong and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”
2SA.2.8	But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, had taken 
2SA.2.9	He made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, even over all Israel. 
2SA.2.10	Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he was king for two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David. 
2SA.2.11	The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2SA.2.12	Now Abner the son of Ner, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon with the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul. 
2SA.2.13	And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool. 
2SA.2.14	Then Abner said to Joab, “Now let the young men arise and 
2SA.2.15	So they arose and went over by count, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. 
2SA.2.16	Each one of them seized his opponent by the head and 
2SA.2.17	That day the battle was very severe, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.
2SA.2.18	Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel; and Asahel 
2SA.2.19	Asahel pursued Abner and did not turn to the right or to the left from following Abner. 
2SA.2.20	Then Abner looked behind him and said, “Is that you, Asahel?” And he answered, “It is I.” 
2SA.2.21	So Abner said to him, “Turn to your right or to your left, and take hold of one of the young men for yourself, and take for yourself his spoil.” But Asahel was not willing to turn aside from following him. 
2SA.2.22	Abner repeated again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?” 
2SA.2.23	However, he refused to turn aside; therefore Abner struck him in the belly with the butt end of the spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died on the spot. And it came about that all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.
2SA.2.24	But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and when the sun was going down, they came to the hill of Ammah, which is in front of Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. 
2SA.2.25	The sons of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became one band, and they stood on the top of a certain hill. 
2SA.2.26	Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the end? How long will you refrain from telling the people to turn back from following their brothers?” 
2SA.2.27	Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then the people would have gone away in the morning, each from following his brother.” 
2SA.2.28	So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people halted and pursued Israel no longer, nor did they continue to fight anymore. 
2SA.2.29	Abner and his men then went through the Arabah all that night; so they crossed the Jordan, walked all morning, and came to Mahanaim.
2SA.2.30	Then Joab returned from following Abner; when he had gathered all the people together, nineteen of David’s servants besides Asahel were missing. 
2SA.2.31	But the servants of David had struck down many of Benjamin and Abner’s men, 
2SA.2.32	And they took up Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb which was in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men went all night until the day dawned at Hebron.
2SA.3.1	Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; and David grew steadily stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker continually.
2SA.3.2	Sons were born to David at Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; 
2SA.3.3	and his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur; 
2SA.3.4	and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; 
2SA.3.5	and the sixth, Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These were born to David at Hebron.
2SA.3.6	It came about while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David that Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul. 
2SA.3.7	Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?” 
2SA.3.8	Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said, “Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hands of David; and yet today you charge me with a guilt concerning the woman. 
2SA.3.9	May God do so to Abner, and more also, if as the L
2SA.3.10	to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.” 
2SA.3.11	And he could no longer answer Abner a word, because he was afraid of him.
2SA.3.12	Then Abner sent messengers to David in his place, saying, “Whose is the land? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel over to you.” 
2SA.3.13	He said, “Good! I will make a covenant with you, but I demand one thing of you, namely, you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see me.” 
2SA.3.14	So David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Give me my wife Michal, to whom I was betrothed for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.” 
2SA.3.15	Ish-bosheth sent and took her from 
2SA.3.16	But her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go, return.” So he returned.
2SA.3.17	Now Abner had consultation with the elders of Israel, saying, “In times past you were seeking for David to be king over you. 
2SA.3.18	Now then, do 
2SA.3.19	Abner also spoke in the hearing of Benjamin; and in addition Abner went to speak in the hearing of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and to the whole house of Benjamin.
2SA.3.20	Then Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him. 
2SA.3.21	Abner said to David, “Let me arise and go and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may be king over all that your soul desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
2SA.3.22	And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoil with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. 
2SA.3.23	When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, they told Joab, saying, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.” 
2SA.3.24	Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why then have you sent him away and he is already gone? 
2SA.3.25	You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you and to learn of your going out and coming in and to find out all that you are doing.”
2SA.3.26	When Joab came out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David did not know 
2SA.3.27	So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the belly so that he died on account of the blood of Asahel his brother. 
2SA.3.28	Afterward when David heard it, he said, “I and my kingdom are innocent before the L
2SA.3.29	May it fall on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house; and may there not fail from the house of Joab one who has a discharge, or who is a leper, or who takes hold of a distaff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.” 
2SA.3.30	So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.
2SA.3.31	Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes and gird on sackcloth and lament before Abner.” And King David walked behind the bier. 
2SA.3.32	Thus they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. 
2SA.3.33	The king chanted a 
2SA.3.33	“Should Abner die as a fool dies?
2SA.3.34	Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put in fetters;
2SA.3.34	As one falls before the wicked, you have fallen.”
2SA.3.34	And all the people wept again over him. 
2SA.3.35	Then all the people came to persuade David to eat bread while it was still day; but David vowed, saying, “May God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down.” 
2SA.3.36	Now all the people took note 
2SA.3.37	So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been 
2SA.3.38	Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? 
2SA.3.39	I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too difficult for me. May the L
2SA.4.1	Now when Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel was disturbed. 
2SA.4.2	Saul’s son 
2SA.4.3	and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been aliens there until this day).
2SA.4.4	Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the report of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened that in her hurry to flee, he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
2SA.4.5	So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, departed and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day while he was taking his midday rest. 
2SA.4.6	They came to the middle of the house as if to get wheat, and they struck him in the belly; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. 
2SA.4.7	Now when they came into the house, as he was lying on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and killed him and beheaded him. And they took his head and traveled by way of the Arabah all night. 
2SA.4.8	Then they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, “Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; thus the L
2SA.4.9	David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the L
2SA.4.10	when one told me, saying, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for 
2SA.4.11	How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood from your hand and destroy you from the earth?” 
2SA.4.12	Then David commanded the young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hung them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
2SA.5.1	Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh. 
2SA.5.2	Previously, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and in. And the L
2SA.5.3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them before the L
2SA.5.4	David was thirty years old when he became king, 
2SA.5.5	At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
2SA.5.6	Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, and they said to David, “You shall not come in here, but the blind and lame will turn you away”; thinking, “David cannot enter here.” 
2SA.5.7	Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Zion, that is the city of David. 
2SA.5.8	David said on that day, “Whoever would strike the Jebusites, let him reach the lame and the blind, who are hated by David’s soul, through the water tunnel.” Therefore they say, “The blind or the lame shall not come into the house.” 
2SA.5.9	So David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David. And David built all around from the 
2SA.5.10	David became greater and greater, for the L
2SA.5.11	Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees and carpenters and stonemasons; and they built a house for David. 
2SA.5.12	And David realized that the L
2SA.5.13	Meanwhile David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David. 
2SA.5.14	Now these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
2SA.5.15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.17	When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek out David; and when David heard 
2SA.5.18	Now the Philistines came and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.19	Then David inquired of the L
2SA.5.20	So David came to Baal-perazim and defeated them there; and he said, “The L
2SA.5.21	They abandoned their idols there, so David and his men carried them away.
2SA.5.22	Now the Philistines came up once again and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.23	When David inquired of the L
2SA.5.24	It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the 
2SA.5.25	Then David did so, just as the L
2SA.6.1	Now David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. 
2SA.6.2	And David arose and went with all the people who were with him to Baale-judah, to bring up from there the ark of God which is called by the Name, the very name of the L
2SA.6.3	They placed the ark of God on a new cart that they might bring it from the house of Abinadab which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the new cart. 
2SA.6.4	So they brought it with the ark of God from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Ahio was walking ahead of the ark. 
2SA.6.5	Meanwhile, David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the L
2SA.6.6	But when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out toward the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen nearly upset 
2SA.6.7	And the anger of the L
2SA.6.8	David became angry because of the L
2SA.6.9	So David was afraid of the L
2SA.6.10	And David was unwilling to move the ark of the L
2SA.6.11	Thus the ark of the L
2SA.6.12	Now it was told King David, saying, “The L
2SA.6.13	And so it was, that when the bearers of the ark of the L
2SA.6.14	And David was dancing before the L
2SA.6.15	So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of the L
2SA.6.16	Then it happened 
2SA.6.17	So they brought in the ark of the L
2SA.6.18	When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offering, he blessed the people in the name of the L
2SA.6.19	Further, he distributed to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, both to men and women, a cake of bread and one of dates and one of raisins to each one. Then all the people departed each to his house.
2SA.6.20	But when David returned to bless his household, Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, “How the king of Israel distinguished himself today! He uncovered himself today in the eyes of his servants’ maids as one of the foolish ones shamelessly uncovers himself!” 
2SA.6.21	So David said to Michal, “
2SA.6.22	I will be more lightly esteemed than this and will be humble in my own eyes, but with the maids of whom you have spoken, with them I will be distinguished.” 
2SA.6.23	Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
2SA.7.1	Now it came about when the king lived in his house, and the L
2SA.7.2	that the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within tent curtains.” 
2SA.7.3	Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your mind, for the L
2SA.7.4	But in the same night the word of the L
2SA.7.5	“Go and say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the L
2SA.7.6	For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought up the sons of Israel from Egypt, even to this day; but I have been moving about in a tent, even in a tabernacle. 
2SA.7.7	Wherever I have gone with all the sons of Israel, did I speak a word with one of the tribes of Israel, which I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’ ” ’
2SA.7.8	Now therefore, thus you shall say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the L
2SA.7.9	I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great name, like the names of the great men who are on the earth. 
2SA.7.10	I will also appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them, that they may live in their own place and not be disturbed again, nor will the wicked afflict them any more as formerly, 
2SA.7.11	even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. The L
2SA.7.12	When your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom. 
2SA.7.13	He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 
2SA.7.14	I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men, 
2SA.7.15	but My lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took 
2SA.7.16	Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.” ’ ” 
2SA.7.17	In accordance with all these words and all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
2SA.7.18	Then David the king went in and sat before the L
2SA.7.19	And yet this was insignificant in Your eyes, O Lord G
2SA.7.20	Again what more can David say to You? For You know Your servant, O Lord G
2SA.7.21	For the sake of Your word, and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness to let Your servant know. 
2SA.7.22	For this reason You are great, O Lord G
2SA.7.23	And what one nation on the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people and to make a name for Himself, and to do a great thing for You and awesome things for Your land, before Your people whom You have redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, 
2SA.7.24	For You have established for Yourself Your people Israel as Your own people forever, and You, O L
2SA.7.25	Now therefore, O L
2SA.7.26	that Your name may be magnified forever, by saying, ‘The L
2SA.7.27	For You, O L
2SA.7.28	Now, O Lord G
2SA.7.29	Now therefore, may it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You. For You, O Lord G
2SA.8.1	Now after this it came about that David defeated the Philistines and subdued them; and David took control of the chief city from the hand of the Philistines.
2SA.8.2	He defeated Moab, and measured them with the line, making them lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute.
2SA.8.3	Then David defeated Hadadezer, the son of Rehob king of Zobah, as he went to restore his rule at the 
2SA.8.4	David captured from him 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers; and David hamstrung the chariot horses, but reserved 
2SA.8.5	When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David killed 22,000 Arameans. 
2SA.8.6	Then David put garrisons among the Arameans of Damascus, and the Arameans became servants to David, bringing tribute. And the L
2SA.8.7	David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 
2SA.8.8	From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a very large amount of bronze.
2SA.8.9	Now when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer, 
2SA.8.10	Toi sent Joram his son to King David to greet him and bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him; for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi. And 
2SA.8.11	King David also dedicated these to the L
2SA.8.12	from 
2SA.8.13	So David made a name 
2SA.8.14	He put garrisons in Edom. In all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the L
2SA.8.15	So David reigned over all Israel; and David administered justice and righteousness for all his people. 
2SA.8.16	Joab the son of Zeruiah 
2SA.8.17	Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar 
2SA.8.18	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief ministers.
2SA.9.1	Then David said, “Is there yet anyone left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?” 
2SA.9.2	Now there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” And he said, “
2SA.9.3	The king said, “Is there not yet anyone of the house of Saul to whom I may show the kindness of God?” And Ziba said to the king, “There is still a son of Jonathan who is crippled in both feet.” 
2SA.9.4	So the king said to him, “Where is he?” And Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in Lo-debar.” 
2SA.9.5	Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. 
2SA.9.6	Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and prostrated himself. And David said, “Mephibosheth.” And he said, “Here is your servant!” 
2SA.9.7	David said to him, “Do not fear, for I will surely show kindness to you for the sake of your father Jonathan, and will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul; and you shall eat at my table regularly.” 
2SA.9.8	Again he prostrated himself and said, “What is your servant, that you should regard a dead dog like me?”
2SA.9.9	Then the king called Saul’s servant Ziba and said to him, “All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master’s grandson. 
2SA.9.10	You and your sons and your servants shall cultivate the land for him, and you shall bring in 
2SA.9.11	Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king commands his servant so your servant will do.” So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table as one of the king’s sons. 
2SA.9.12	Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. And all who lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth. 
2SA.9.13	So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he ate at the king’s table regularly. Now he was lame in both feet.
2SA.10.1	Now it happened afterwards that the king of the Ammonites died, and Hanun his son became king in his place. 
2SA.10.2	Then David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent some of his servants to console him concerning his father. But when David’s servants came to the land of the Ammonites, 
2SA.10.3	the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David is honoring your father because he has sent consolers to you? Has David not sent his servants to you in order to search the city, to spy it out and overthrow it?” 
2SA.10.4	So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved off half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle as far as their hips, and sent them away. 
2SA.10.5	When they told 
2SA.10.6	Now when the sons of Ammon saw that they had become odious to David, the sons of Ammon sent and hired the Arameans of Beth-rehob and the Arameans of Zobah, 20,000 foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with 1,000 men, and the men of Tob with 12,000 men. 
2SA.10.7	When David heard 
2SA.10.8	The sons of Ammon came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, while the Arameans of Zobah and of Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah 
2SA.10.9	Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and in the rear, he selected from all the choice men of Israel, and arrayed 
2SA.10.10	But the remainder of the people he placed in the hand of Abishai his brother, and he arrayed 
2SA.10.11	He said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come to help you. 
2SA.10.12	Be strong, and let us show ourselves courageous for the sake of our people and for the cities of our God; and may the L
2SA.10.13	So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Arameans, and they fled before him. 
2SA.10.14	When the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans fled, they 
2SA.10.15	When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together. 
2SA.10.16	And Hadadezer sent and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the 
2SA.10.17	Now when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Arameans arrayed themselves to meet David and fought against him. 
2SA.10.18	But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed 700 charioteers of the Arameans and 40,000 horsemen and struck down Shobach the commander of their army, and he died there. 
2SA.10.19	When all the kings, servants of Hadadezer, saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Arameans feared to help the sons of Ammon anymore.
2SA.11.1	Then it happened in the spring, at the time when kings go out 
2SA.11.2	Now when evening came David arose from his bed and walked around on the roof of the king’s house, and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful in appearance. 
2SA.11.3	So David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, “Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?” 
2SA.11.4	David sent messengers and took her, and when she came to him, he lay with her; and when she had purified herself from her uncleanness, she returned to her house. 
2SA.11.5	The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, “I am pregnant.”
2SA.11.6	Then David sent to Joab, 
2SA.11.7	When Uriah came to him, David asked concerning the welfare of Joab and the people and the state of the war. 
2SA.11.8	Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet.” And Uriah went out of the king’s house, and a present from the king was sent out after him. 
2SA.11.9	But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house. 
2SA.11.10	Now when they told David, saying, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?” 
2SA.11.11	Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in temporary shelters, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? By your life and the life of your soul, I will not do this thing.” 
2SA.11.12	Then David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you go.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. 
2SA.11.13	Now David called him, and he ate and drank before him, and he made him drunk; and in the evening he went out to lie on his bed with his lord’s servants, but he did not go down to his house.
2SA.11.14	Now in the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent 
2SA.11.15	He had written in the letter, saying, “Place Uriah in the front line of the fiercest battle and withdraw from him, so that he may be struck down and die.” 
2SA.11.16	So it was as Joab kept watch on the city, that he put Uriah at the place where he knew there 
2SA.11.17	The men of the city went out and fought against Joab, and some of the people among David’s servants fell; and Uriah the Hittite also died. 
2SA.11.18	Then Joab sent and reported to David all the events of the war. 
2SA.11.19	He charged the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling all the events of the war to the king, 
2SA.11.20	and if it happens that the king’s wrath rises and he says to you, ‘Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall? 
2SA.11.21	Who struck down Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’—then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.’ ”
2SA.11.22	So the messenger departed and came and reported to David all that Joab had sent him 
2SA.11.23	The messenger said to David, “The men prevailed against us and came out against us in the field, but we pressed them as far as the entrance of the gate. 
2SA.11.24	Moreover, the archers shot at your servants from the wall; so some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.” 
2SA.11.25	Then David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall say to Joab, ‘Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another; make your battle against the city stronger and overthrow it’; and 
2SA.11.26	Now when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. 
2SA.11.27	When the 
2SA.12.1	Then the L
2SA.12.1	“There were two men in one city, the one rich and the other poor.
2SA.12.2	The rich man had a great many flocks and herds.
2SA.12.3	But the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb
2SA.12.3	Which he bought and nourished;
2SA.12.3	And it grew up together with him and his children.
2SA.12.3	It would eat of his bread and drink of his cup and lie in his bosom,
2SA.12.3	And was like a daughter to him.
2SA.12.4	Now a traveler came to the rich man,
2SA.12.4	And he was unwilling to take from his own flock or his own herd,
2SA.12.4	To prepare for the wayfarer who had come to him;
2SA.12.4	Rather he took the poor man’s ewe lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”
2SA.12.5	Then David’s anger burned greatly against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As the L
2SA.12.6	He must make restitution for the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing and had no compassion.”
2SA.12.7	Nathan then said to David, “You are the man! Thus says the L
2SA.12.8	I also gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your care, and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah; and if 
2SA.12.9	Why have you despised the word of the L
2SA.12.10	Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’ 
2SA.12.11	Thus says the L
2SA.12.12	Indeed you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and under the sun.’ ” 
2SA.12.13	Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the L
2SA.12.14	However, because by this deed you have given occasion to the enemies of the L
2SA.12.15	So Nathan went to his house.
2SA.12.16	David therefore inquired of God for the child; and David fasted and went and lay all night on the ground. 
2SA.12.17	The elders of his household stood beside him in order to raise him up from the ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat food with them. 
2SA.12.18	Then it happened on the seventh day that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Behold, while the child was 
2SA.12.19	But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; so David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” And they said, “He is dead.” 
2SA.12.20	So David arose from the ground, washed, anointed 
2SA.12.21	Then his servants said to him, “What is this thing that you have done? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept; but when the child died, you arose and ate food.” 
2SA.12.22	He said, “While the child was 
2SA.12.23	But now he has died; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”
2SA.12.24	Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and went in to her and lay with her; and she gave birth to a son, and he named him Solomon. Now the L
2SA.12.25	and sent 
2SA.12.26	Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon and captured the royal city. 
2SA.12.27	Joab sent messengers to David and said, “I have fought against Rabbah, I have even captured the city of waters. 
2SA.12.28	Now therefore, gather the rest of the people together and camp against the city and capture it, or I will capture the city myself and it will be named after me.” 
2SA.12.29	So David gathered all the people and went to Rabbah, fought against it and captured it. 
2SA.12.30	Then he took the crown of their king from his head; and its weight 
2SA.12.31	He also brought out the people who were in it, and set 
2SA.13.1	Now it was after this that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar, and Amnon the son of David loved her. 
2SA.13.2	Amnon was so frustrated because of his sister Tamar that he made himself ill, for she was a virgin, and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her. 
2SA.13.3	But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very shrewd man. 
2SA.13.4	He said to him, “O son of the king, why are you so depressed morning after morning? Will you not tell me?” Then Amnon said to him, “I am in love with Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.” 
2SA.13.5	Jonadab then said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill; when your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me 
2SA.13.6	So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”
2SA.13.7	Then David sent to the house for Tamar, saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.” 
2SA.13.8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house, and he was lying down. And she took dough, kneaded 
2SA.13.9	She took the pan and dished 
2SA.13.10	Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom, that I may eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the bedroom to her brother Amnon. 
2SA.13.11	When she brought 
2SA.13.12	But she answered him, “No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this disgraceful thing! 
2SA.13.13	As for me, where could I get rid of my reproach? And as for you, you will be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.” 
2SA.13.14	However, he would not listen to her; since he was stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon hated her with a very great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, “Get up, go away!” 
2SA.13.16	But she said to him, “No, because this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you have done to me!” Yet he would not listen to her. 
2SA.13.17	Then he called his young man who attended him and said, “Now throw this woman out of my 
2SA.13.18	Now she had on a long-sleeved garment; for in this manner the virgin daughters of the king dressed themselves in robes. Then his attendant took her out and locked the door behind her. 
2SA.13.19	Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her long-sleeved garment which 
2SA.13.20	Then Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now keep silent, my sister, he is your brother; do not take this matter to heart.” So Tamar remained and was desolate in her brother Absalom’s house. 
2SA.13.21	Now when King David heard of all these matters, he was very angry. 
2SA.13.22	But Absalom did not speak to Amnon either good or bad; for Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar.
2SA.13.23	Now it came about after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.
2SA.13.24	Absalom came to the king and said, “Behold now, your servant has sheepshearers; please let the king and his servants go with your servant.” 
2SA.13.25	But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, we should not all go, for we will be burdensome to you.” Although he urged him, he would not go, but blessed him. 
2SA.13.26	Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.” And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?” 
2SA.13.27	But when Absalom urged him, he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.
2SA.13.28	Absalom commanded his servants, saying, “See now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then put him to death. Do not fear; have not I myself commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant.” 
2SA.13.29	The servants of Absalom did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose and each mounted his mule and fled.
2SA.13.30	Now it was while they were on the way that the report came to David, saying, “Absalom has struck down all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left.” 
2SA.13.31	Then the king arose, tore his clothes and lay on the ground; and all his servants were standing by with clothes torn. 
2SA.13.32	Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, responded, “Do not let my lord suppose they have put to death all the young men, the king’s sons, for Amnon alone is dead; because by the intent of Absalom this has been determined since the day that he violated his sister Tamar. 
2SA.13.33	Now therefore, do not let my lord the king take the report to heart, namely, ‘all the king’s sons are dead,’ for only Amnon is dead.”
2SA.13.34	Now Absalom had fled. And the young man who was the watchman raised his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain. 
2SA.13.35	Jonadab said to the king, “Behold, the king’s sons have come; according to your servant’s word, so it happened.” 
2SA.13.36	As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons came and lifted their voices and wept; and also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly.
2SA.13.37	Now Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. And 
2SA.13.38	So Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur, and was there three years. 
2SA.13.39	 King David longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead.
2SA.14.1	Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart 
2SA.14.2	So Joab sent to Tekoa and brought a wise woman from there and said to her, “Please pretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning garments now, and do not anoint yourself with oil, but be like a woman who has been mourning for the dead many days; 
2SA.14.3	then go to the king and speak to him in this manner.” So Joab put the words in her mouth.
2SA.14.4	Now when the woman of Tekoa 
2SA.14.5	The king said to her, “What is your trouble?” And she answered, “Truly I am a widow, for my husband is dead. 
2SA.14.6	Your maidservant had two sons, but the two of them struggled together in the field, and there was no 
2SA.14.7	Now behold, the whole family has risen against your maidservant, and they say, ‘Hand over the one who struck his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed, and destroy the heir also.’ Thus they will extinguish my coal which is left, so as to leave my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth.”
2SA.14.8	Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.” 
2SA.14.9	The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “O my lord, the king, the iniquity is on me and my father’s house, but the king and his throne are guiltless.” 
2SA.14.10	So the king said, “Whoever speaks to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you anymore.” 
2SA.14.11	Then she said, “Please let the king remember the L
2SA.14.12	Then the woman said, “Please let your maidservant speak a word to my lord the king.” And he said, “Speak.” 
2SA.14.13	The woman said, “Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, 
2SA.14.14	For we will surely die and are like water spilled on the ground which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away life, but plans ways so that the banished one will not be cast out from him. 
2SA.14.15	Now the reason I have come to speak this word to my lord the king is that the people have made me afraid; so your maidservant said, ‘Let me now speak to the king, perhaps the king will perform the request of his maidservant. 
2SA.14.16	For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man who would destroy both me and my son from the inheritance of God.’ 
2SA.14.17	Then your maidservant said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king be comforting, for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and evil. And may the L
2SA.14.18	Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not hide anything from me that I am about to ask you.” And the woman said, “Let my lord the king please speak.” 
2SA.14.19	So the king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” And the woman replied, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. Indeed, it was your servant Joab who commanded me, and it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant; 
2SA.14.20	in order to change the appearance of things your servant Joab has done this thing. But my lord is wise, like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know all that is in the earth.”
2SA.14.21	Then the king said to Joab, “Behold now, I will surely do this thing; go therefore, bring back the young man Absalom.” 
2SA.14.22	Joab fell on his face to the ground, prostrated himself and blessed the king; then Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, O my lord, the king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.” 
2SA.14.23	So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 
2SA.14.24	However the king said, “Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face.” So Absalom turned to his own house and did not see the king’s face.
2SA.14.25	Now in all Israel was no one as handsome as Absalom, so highly praised; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no defect in him. 
2SA.14.26	When he cut the hair of his head (and it was at the end of every year that he cut 
2SA.14.27	To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of beautiful appearance.
2SA.14.28	Now Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, and did not see the king’s face. 
2SA.14.29	Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. So he sent again a second time, but he would not come. 
2SA.14.30	Therefore he said to his servants, “See, Joab’s 
2SA.14.31	Then Joab arose, came to Absalom at his house and said to him, “Why have your servants set my 
2SA.14.32	Absalom answered Joab, “Behold, I sent for you, saying, ‘Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me still to be there.” ’ Now therefore, let me see the king’s face, and if there is iniquity in me, let him put me to death.” 
2SA.14.33	So when Joab came to the king and told him, he called for Absalom. Thus he came to the king and prostrated himself on his face to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom.
2SA.15.1	Now it came about after this that Absalom provided for himself a chariot and horses and fifty men as runners before him. 
2SA.15.2	Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the way to the gate; and when any man had a suit to come to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, “From what city are you?” And he would say, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.” 
2SA.15.3	Then Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right, but no man listens to you on the part of the king.” 
2SA.15.4	Moreover, Absalom would say, “Oh that one would appoint me judge in the land, then every man who has any suit or cause could come to me and I would give him justice.” 
2SA.15.5	And when a man came near to prostrate himself before him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. 
2SA.15.6	In this manner Absalom dealt with all Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole away the hearts of the men of Israel.
2SA.15.7	Now it came about at the end of 
2SA.15.8	For your servant vowed a vow while I was living at Geshur in Aram, saying, ‘If the L
2SA.15.9	The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose and went to Hebron. 
2SA.15.10	But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron.’ ” 
2SA.15.11	Then two hundred men went with Absalom from Jerusalem, who were invited and went innocently, and they did not know anything. 
2SA.15.12	And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom.
2SA.15.13	Then a messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.” 
2SA.15.14	David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise and let us flee, for 
2SA.15.15	Then the king’s servants said to the king, “Behold, your servants 
2SA.15.16	So the king went out and all his household with him. But the king left ten concubines to keep the house. 
2SA.15.17	The king went out and all the people with him, and they stopped at the last house. 
2SA.15.18	Now all his servants passed on beside him, all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had come with him from Gath, passed on before the king.
2SA.15.19	Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why will you also go with us? Return and remain with the king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile; 
2SA.15.20	You came 
2SA.15.21	But Ittai answered the king and said, “As the L
2SA.15.22	Therefore David said to Ittai, “Go and pass over.” So Ittai the Gittite passed over with all his men and all the little ones who 
2SA.15.23	While all the country was weeping with a loud voice, all the people passed over. The king also passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness.
2SA.15.24	Now behold, Zadok also 
2SA.15.25	The king said to Zadok, “Return the ark of God to the city. If I find favor in the sight of the L
2SA.15.26	But if He should say thus, ‘I have no delight in you,’ behold, here I am, let Him do to me as seems good to Him.” 
2SA.15.27	The king said also to Zadok the priest, “Are you 
2SA.15.28	See, I am going to wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.” 
2SA.15.29	Therefore Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and remained there.
2SA.15.30	And David went up the ascent of the 
2SA.15.31	Now someone told David, saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” And David said, “O L
2SA.15.32	It happened as David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, that behold, Hushai the Archite met him with his coat torn and dust on his head. 
2SA.15.33	David said to him, “If you pass over with me, then you will be a burden to me. 
2SA.15.34	But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father’s servant in time past, so I will now be your servant,’ then you can thwart the counsel of Ahithophel for me. 
2SA.15.35	Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So it shall be that whatever you hear from the king’s house, you shall report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 
2SA.15.36	Behold their two sons are with them there, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them you shall send me everything that you hear.” 
2SA.15.37	So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
2SA.16.1	Now when David had passed a little beyond the summit, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them 
2SA.16.2	The king said to Ziba, “Why do you have these?” And Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine, for whoever is faint in the wilderness to drink.” 
2SA.16.3	Then the king said, “And where is your master’s son?” And Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.’ ” 
2SA.16.4	So the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.” And Ziba said, “I prostrate myself; let me find favor in your sight, O my lord, the king!”
2SA.16.5	When King David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out from there a man of the family of the house of Saul whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out cursing continually as he came. 
2SA.16.6	He threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the mighty men were at his right hand and at his left. 
2SA.16.7	Thus Shimei said when he cursed, “Get out, get out, you man of bloodshed, and worthless fellow! 
2SA.16.8	The L
2SA.16.9	Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over now and cut off his head.” 
2SA.16.10	But the king said, “What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah? If he curses, and if the L
2SA.16.11	Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Behold, my son who came out from me seeks my life; how much more now this Benjamite? Let him alone and let him curse, for the L
2SA.16.12	Perhaps the L
2SA.16.13	So David and his men went on the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside parallel with him and as he went he cursed and cast stones and threw dust at him. 
2SA.16.14	The king and all the people who were with him arrived weary and he refreshed himself there.
2SA.16.15	Then Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. 
2SA.16.16	Now it came about when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, “
2SA.16.17	Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?” 
2SA.16.18	Then Hushai said to Absalom, “No! For whom the L
2SA.16.19	Besides, whom should I serve? 
2SA.16.20	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your advice. What shall we do?” 
2SA.16.21	Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself odious to your father. The hands of all who are with you will also be strengthened.” 
2SA.16.22	So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel. 
2SA.16.23	The advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, 
2SA.17.1	Furthermore, Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Please let me choose 12,000 men that I may arise and pursue David tonight. 
2SA.17.2	I will come upon him while he is weary and exhausted and terrify him, so that all the people who are with him will flee. Then I will strike down the king alone, 
2SA.17.3	and I will bring back all the people to you. The return of everyone depends on the man you seek; 
2SA.17.4	So the plan pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
2SA.17.5	Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say.” 
2SA.17.6	When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom said to him, “Ahithophel has spoken thus. Shall we carry out his plan? If not, you speak.” 
2SA.17.7	So Hushai said to Absalom, “This time the advice that Ahithophel has given is not good.” 
2SA.17.8	Moreover, Hushai said, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men and they are fierce, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. And your father is an expert in warfare, and will not spend the night with the people. 
2SA.17.9	Behold, he has now hidden himself in one of the caves or in another place; and it will be when he falls on them at the first attack, that whoever hears 
2SA.17.10	And even the one who is valiant, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will completely lose heart; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and those who are with him are valiant men. 
2SA.17.11	But I counsel that all Israel be surely gathered to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea in abundance, and that you personally go into battle. 
2SA.17.12	So we shall come to him in one of the places where he can be found, and we will fall on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him, not even one will be left. 
2SA.17.13	If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it into the valley until not even a small stone is found there.” 
2SA.17.14	Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” For the L
2SA.17.15	Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “This is what Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is what I have counseled. 
2SA.17.16	Now therefore, send quickly and tell David, saying, ‘Do not spend the night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means cross over, or else the king and all the people who are with him will be destroyed.’ ” 
2SA.17.17	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel, and a maidservant would go and tell them, and they would go and tell King David, for they could not be seen entering the city. 
2SA.17.18	But a lad did see them and told Absalom; so the two of them departed quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard, and they went down into it. 
2SA.17.19	And the woman took a covering and spread it over the well’s mouth and scattered grain on it, so that nothing was known. 
2SA.17.20	Then Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house and said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” And the woman said to them, “They have crossed the brook of water.” And when they searched and could not find 
2SA.17.21	It came about after they had departed that they came up out of the well and went and told King David; and they said to David, “Arise and cross over the water quickly for thus Ahithophel has counseled against you.” 
2SA.17.22	Then David and all the people who 
2SA.17.23	Now when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled 
2SA.17.24	Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 
2SA.17.25	Absalom set Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother. 
2SA.17.26	And Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.
2SA.17.27	Now when David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim, 
2SA.17.28	brought beds, basins, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, parched 
2SA.17.29	honey, curds, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David and for the people who 
2SA.18.1	Then David numbered the people who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. 
2SA.18.2	David sent the people out, one third under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, “I myself will surely go out with you also.” 
2SA.18.3	But the people said, “You should not go out; for if we indeed flee, they will not care about us; even if half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that you 
2SA.18.4	Then the king said to them, “Whatever seems best to you I will do.” So the king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and thousands. 
2SA.18.5	The king charged Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “
2SA.18.6	Then the people went out into the field against Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim. 
2SA.18.7	The people of Israel were defeated there before the servants of David, and the slaughter there that day was great, 20,000 men. 
2SA.18.8	For the battle there was spread over the whole countryside, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
2SA.18.9	Now Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. For Absalom was riding on 
2SA.18.10	When a certain man saw 
2SA.18.11	Then Joab said to the man who had told him, “Now behold, you saw 
2SA.18.12	The man said to Joab, “Even if I should receive a thousand 
2SA.18.13	Otherwise, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof.” 
2SA.18.14	Then Joab said, “I will not waste time here with you.” So he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak. 
2SA.18.15	And ten young men who carried Joab’s armor gathered around and struck Absalom and killed him.
2SA.18.16	Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained the people. 
2SA.18.17	They took Absalom and cast him into a deep pit in the forest and erected over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled, each to his tent. 
2SA.18.18	Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself a pillar which is in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to preserve my name.” So he named the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom’s Monument to this day.
2SA.18.19	Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Please let me run and bring the king news that the L
2SA.18.20	But Joab said to him, “You are not the man to carry news this day, but you shall carry news another day; however, you shall carry no news today because the king’s son is dead.” 
2SA.18.21	Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” So the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran. 
2SA.18.22	Now Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said once more to Joab, “But whatever happens, please let me also run after the Cushite.” And Joab said, “Why would you run, my son, since you will have no reward for going?” 
2SA.18.23	“But whatever happens,” 
2SA.18.24	Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall, and raised his eyes and looked, and behold, a man running by himself. 
2SA.18.25	The watchman called and told the king. And the king said, “If he is by himself there is good news in his mouth.” And he came nearer and nearer. 
2SA.18.26	Then the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, “Behold, 
2SA.18.27	The watchman said, “I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” And the king said, “This is a good man and comes with good news.”
2SA.18.28	Ahimaaz called and said to the king, “
2SA.18.29	The king said, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” And Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant, and your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I did not know what 
2SA.18.30	Then the king said, “Turn aside and stand here.” So he turned aside and stood still.
2SA.18.31	Behold, the Cushite arrived, and the Cushite said, “Let my lord the king receive good news, for the L
2SA.18.32	Then the king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” And the Cushite answered, “Let the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you for evil, be as that young man!”
2SA.18.33	The king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And thus he said as he walked, “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!”
2SA.19.1	Then it was told Joab, “Behold, the king is weeping and mourns for Absalom.” 
2SA.19.2	The victory that day was turned to mourning for all the people, for the people heard 
2SA.19.3	So the people went by stealth into the city that day, as people who are humiliated steal away when they flee in battle. 
2SA.19.4	The king covered his face and cried out with a loud voice, “O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!” 
2SA.19.5	Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, “Today you have covered with shame the faces of all your servants, who today have saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters, the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines, 
2SA.19.6	by loving those who hate you, and by hating those who love you. For you have shown today that princes and servants are nothing to you; for I know this day that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased. 
2SA.19.7	Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants, for I swear by the L
2SA.19.8	So the king arose and sat in the gate. When they told all the people, saying, “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate,” then all the people came before the king.
2SA.19.9	All the people were quarreling throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies and saved us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled out of the land from Absalom. 
2SA.19.10	However, Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. Now then, why are you silent about bringing the king back?”
2SA.19.11	Then King David sent to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house, since the word of all Israel has come to the king, 
2SA.19.12	You are my brothers; you are my bone and my flesh. Why then should you be the last to bring back the king?’ 
2SA.19.13	Say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to me, and more also, if you will not be commander of the army before me continually in place of Joab.’ ” 
2SA.19.14	Thus he turned the hearts of all the men of Judah as one man, so that they sent 
2SA.19.15	The king then returned and came as far as the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal in order to go to meet the king, to bring the king across the Jordan.
2SA.19.16	Then Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite who was from Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David. 
2SA.19.17	There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, with Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they rushed to the Jordan before the king. 
2SA.19.18	Then they kept crossing the ford to bring over the king’s household, and to do what was good in his sight. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was about to cross the Jordan. 
2SA.19.19	So he said to the king, “Let not my lord consider me guilty, nor remember what your servant did wrong on the day when my lord the king came out from Jerusalem, so that the king would take 
2SA.19.20	For your servant knows that I have sinned; therefore behold, I have come today, the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.” 
2SA.19.21	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah said, “Should not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the L
2SA.19.22	David then said, “What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be an adversary to me? Should any man be put to death in Israel today? For do I not know that I am king over Israel today?” 
2SA.19.23	The king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” Thus the king swore to him.
2SA.19.24	Then Mephibosheth the 
2SA.19.25	It was when he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, “Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?” 
2SA.19.26	So he answered, “O my lord, the king, my servant deceived me; for your servant said, ‘I will saddle a donkey for myself that I may ride on it and go with the king,’ because your servant is lame. 
2SA.19.27	Moreover, he has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is like the angel of God, therefore do what is good in your sight. 
2SA.19.28	For all my father’s household was nothing but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right do I have yet that I should complain anymore to the king?” 
2SA.19.29	So the king said to him, “Why do you still speak of your affairs? I have decided, ‘You and Ziba shall divide the land.’ ” 
2SA.19.30	Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him even take it all, since my lord the king has come safely to his own house.”
2SA.19.31	Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim; and he went on to the Jordan with the king to escort him over the Jordan. 
2SA.19.32	Now Barzillai was very old, being eighty years old; and he had sustained the king while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man. 
2SA.19.33	The king said to Barzillai, “You cross over with me and I will sustain you in Jerusalem with me.” 
2SA.19.34	But Barzillai said to the king, “How long have I yet to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? 
2SA.19.35	I am now eighty years old. Can I distinguish between good and bad? Or can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Or can I hear anymore the voice of singing men and women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? 
2SA.19.36	Your servant would merely cross over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king compensate me 
2SA.19.37	Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. However, here is your servant Chimham, let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what is good in your sight.” 
2SA.19.38	The king answered, “Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what is good in your sight; and whatever you require of me, I will do for you.” 
2SA.19.39	All the people crossed over the Jordan and the king crossed too. The king then kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his place.
2SA.19.40	Now the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; and all the people of Judah and also half the people of Israel accompanied the king. 
2SA.19.41	And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king, “Why had our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king and his household and all David’s men with him over the Jordan?” 
2SA.19.42	Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is a close relative to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king’s 
2SA.19.43	But the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, “We have ten parts in the king, therefore we also have more 
2SA.20.1	Now a worthless fellow happened to be there whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew the trumpet and said,
2SA.20.1	“We have no portion in David,
2SA.20.1	Nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse;
2SA.20.1	Every man to his tents, O Israel!”
2SA.20.2	So all the men of Israel withdrew from following David 
2SA.20.3	Then David came to his house at Jerusalem, and the king took the ten women, the concubines whom he had left to keep the house, and placed them under guard and provided them with sustenance, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up until the day of their death, living as widows.
2SA.20.4	Then the king said to Amasa, “Call out the men of Judah for me within three days, and be present here yourself.” 
2SA.20.5	So Amasa went to call out 
2SA.20.6	And David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom; take your lord’s servants and pursue him, so that he does not find for himself fortified cities and escape from our sight.” 
2SA.20.7	So Joab’s men went out after him, along with the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty men; and they went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.8	When they were at the large stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was dressed in his military attire, and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath fastened at his waist; and as he went forward, it fell out. 
2SA.20.9	Joab said to Amasa, “Is it well with you, my brother?” And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
2SA.20.10	But Amasa was not on guard against the sword which was in Joab’s hand so he struck him in the belly with it and poured out his inward parts on the ground, and did not 
2SA.20.11	Now there stood by him one of Joab’s young men, and said, “Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David, 
2SA.20.12	But Amasa lay wallowing in 
2SA.20.13	As soon as he was removed from the highway, all the men passed on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
2SA.20.14	Now he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, even Beth-maacah, and all the Berites; and they were gathered together and also went after him. 
2SA.20.15	They came and besieged him in Abel Beth-maacah, and they cast up a siege ramp against the city, and it stood by the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab were wreaking destruction in order to topple the wall. 
2SA.20.16	Then a wise woman called from the city, “Hear, hear! Please tell Joab, ‘Come here that I may speak with you.’ ” 
2SA.20.17	So he approached her, and the woman said, “Are you Joab?” And he answered, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your maidservant.” And he answered, “I am listening.” 
2SA.20.18	Then she spoke, saying, “Formerly they used to say, ‘They will surely ask 
2SA.20.19	I am of those who are peaceable 
2SA.20.20	Joab replied, “Far be it, far be it from me that I should swallow up or destroy! 
2SA.20.21	Such is not the case. But a man from the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against King David. Only hand him over, and I will depart from the city.” And the woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.” 
2SA.20.22	Then the woman wisely came to all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, each to his tent. Joab also returned to the king at Jerusalem.
2SA.20.23	Now Joab was over the whole army of Israel, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; 
2SA.20.24	and Adoram was over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder; 
2SA.20.25	and Sheva was scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 
2SA.20.26	and Ira the Jairite was also a priest to David.
2SA.21.1	Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David sought the presence of the L
2SA.21.2	So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the sons of Israel but of the remnant of the Amorites, and the sons of Israel made a covenant with them, but Saul had sought to kill them in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah). 
2SA.21.3	Thus David said to the Gibeonites, “What should I do for you? And how can I make atonement that you may bless the inheritance of the L
2SA.21.4	Then the Gibeonites said to him, “We have no 
2SA.21.5	So they said to the king, “The man who consumed us and who planned to exterminate us from remaining within any border of Israel, 
2SA.21.6	let seven men from his sons be given to us, and we will hang them before the L
2SA.21.7	But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath of the L
2SA.21.8	So the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, Armoni and Mephibosheth whom she had borne to Saul, and the five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul, whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite. 
2SA.21.9	Then he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before the L
2SA.21.10	And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until it rained on them from the sky; and she allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night. 
2SA.21.11	When it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done, 
2SA.21.12	then David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the open square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them on the day the Philistines struck down Saul in Gilboa. 
2SA.21.13	He brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there, and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged. 
2SA.21.14	They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the grave of Kish his father; thus they did all that the king commanded, and after that God was moved by prayer for the land.
2SA.21.15	Now when the Philistines were at war again with Israel, David went down and his servants with him; and as they fought against the Philistines, David became weary. 
2SA.21.16	Then Ishbi-benob, who was among the descendants of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred 
2SA.21.17	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “You shall not go out again with us to battle, so that you do not extinguish the lamp of Israel.”
2SA.21.18	Now it came about after this that there was war again with the Philistines at Gob; then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph, who was among the descendants of the giant. 
2SA.21.19	There was war with the Philistines again at Gob, and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 
2SA.21.20	There was war at Gath again, where there was a man of 
2SA.21.21	When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, struck him down. 
2SA.21.22	These four were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
2SA.22.1	And David spoke the words of this song to the L
2SA.22.2	He said,
2SA.22.2	“The L
2SA.22.3	My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge,
2SA.22.3	My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge;
2SA.22.3	My savior, You save me from violence.
2SA.22.4	I call upon the L
2SA.22.4	And I am saved from my enemies.
2SA.22.5	For the waves of death encompassed me;
2SA.22.5	The torrents of destruction overwhelmed me;
2SA.22.6	The cords of Sheol surrounded me;
2SA.22.6	The snares of death confronted me.
2SA.22.7	In my distress I called upon the L
2SA.22.7	Yes, I cried to my God;
2SA.22.7	And from His temple He heard my voice,
2SA.22.7	And my cry for help 
2SA.22.8	Then the earth shook and quaked,
2SA.22.8	The foundations of heaven were trembling
2SA.22.8	And were shaken, because He was angry.
2SA.22.9	Smoke went up out of His nostrils,
2SA.22.9	Fire from His mouth devoured;
2SA.22.9	Coals were kindled by it.
2SA.22.10	He bowed the heavens also, and came down
2SA.22.10	With thick darkness under His feet.
2SA.22.11	And He rode on a cherub and flew;
2SA.22.11	And He appeared on the wings of the wind.
2SA.22.12	And He made darkness canopies around Him,
2SA.22.12	A mass of waters, thick clouds of the sky.
2SA.22.13	From the brightness before Him
2SA.22.13	Coals of fire were kindled.
2SA.22.14	The L
2SA.22.14	And the Most High uttered His voice.
2SA.22.15	And He sent out arrows, and scattered them,
2SA.22.15	Lightning, and routed them.
2SA.22.16	Then the channels of the sea appeared,
2SA.22.16	The foundations of the world were laid bare
2SA.22.16	By the rebuke of the L
2SA.22.16	At the blast of the breath of His nostrils.
2SA.22.17	He sent from on high, He took me;
2SA.22.17	He drew me out of many waters.
2SA.22.18	He delivered me from my strong enemy,
2SA.22.18	From those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.
2SA.22.19	They confronted me in the day of my calamity,
2SA.22.19	But the L
2SA.22.20	He also brought me forth into a broad place;
2SA.22.20	He rescued me, because He delighted in me.
2SA.22.21	The L
2SA.22.21	According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me.
2SA.22.22	For I have kept the ways of the L
2SA.22.22	And have not acted wickedly against my God.
2SA.22.23	For all His ordinances 
2SA.22.23	And 
2SA.22.24	I was also blameless toward Him,
2SA.22.24	And I kept myself from my iniquity.
2SA.22.25	Therefore the L
2SA.22.25	According to my cleanness before His eyes.
2SA.22.26	With the kind You show Yourself kind,
2SA.22.26	With the blameless You show Yourself blameless;
2SA.22.27	With the pure You show Yourself pure,
2SA.22.27	And with the perverted You show Yourself astute.
2SA.22.28	And You save an afflicted people;
2SA.22.28	But Your eyes are on the haughty 
2SA.22.29	For You are my lamp, O L
2SA.22.29	And the L
2SA.22.30	For by You I can 
2SA.22.30	By my God I can leap over a wall.
2SA.22.31	As for God, His way is blameless;
2SA.22.31	The word of the L
2SA.22.31	He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.
2SA.22.32	For who is God, besides the L
2SA.22.32	And who is a rock, besides our God?
2SA.22.33	God is my strong fortress;
2SA.22.33	And He sets the blameless in His way.
2SA.22.34	He makes my feet like hinds’ 
2SA.22.34	And sets me on my high places.
2SA.22.35	He trains my hands for battle,
2SA.22.35	So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
2SA.22.36	You have also given me the shield of Your salvation,
2SA.22.36	And Your help makes me great.
2SA.22.37	You enlarge my steps under me,
2SA.22.37	And my feet have not slipped.
2SA.22.38	I pursued my enemies and destroyed them,
2SA.22.38	And I did not turn back until they were consumed.
2SA.22.39	And I have devoured them and shattered them, so that they did not rise;
2SA.22.39	And they fell under my feet.
2SA.22.40	For You have girded me with strength for battle;
2SA.22.40	You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
2SA.22.41	You have also made my enemies turn 
2SA.22.41	And I destroyed those who hated me.
2SA.22.42	They looked, but there was none to save;
2SA.22.43	Then I pulverized them as the dust of the earth;
2SA.22.43	I crushed 
2SA.22.44	You have also delivered me from the contentions of my people;
2SA.22.44	You have kept me as head of the nations;
2SA.22.44	A people whom I have not known serve me.
2SA.22.45	Foreigners pretend obedience to me;
2SA.22.45	As soon as they hear, they obey me.
2SA.22.46	Foreigners lose heart,
2SA.22.46	And come trembling out of their fortresses.
2SA.22.47	The L
2SA.22.47	And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,
2SA.22.48	The God who executes vengeance for me,
2SA.22.48	And brings down peoples under me,
2SA.22.49	Who also brings me out from my enemies;
2SA.22.49	You even lift me above those who rise up against me;
2SA.22.49	You rescue me from the violent man.
2SA.22.50	Therefore I will give thanks to You, O L
2SA.22.50	And I will sing praises to Your name.
2SA.22.51	And shows lovingkindness to His anointed,
2SA.22.51	To David and his descendants forever.”
2SA.23.1	Now these are the last words of David.
2SA.23.1	David the son of Jesse declares,
2SA.23.1	The man who was raised on high declares,
2SA.23.1	The anointed of the God of Jacob,
2SA.23.1	And the sweet psalmist of Israel,
2SA.23.2	“The Spirit of the L
2SA.23.2	And His word was on my tongue.
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel said,
2SA.23.3	The Rock of Israel spoke to me,
2SA.23.3	‘He who rules over men righteously,
2SA.23.3	Who rules in the fear of God,
2SA.23.4	Is as the light of the morning 
2SA.23.4	A morning without clouds,
2SA.23.4	Through sunshine after rain.’
2SA.23.5	Truly is not my house so with God?
2SA.23.5	For He has made an everlasting covenant with me,
2SA.23.5	Ordered in all things, and secured;
2SA.23.5	For all my salvation and all 
2SA.23.5	Will He not indeed make 
2SA.23.6	But the worthless, every one of them will be thrust away like thorns,
2SA.23.6	Because they cannot be taken in hand;
2SA.23.7	But the man who touches them
2SA.23.7	Must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear,
2SA.23.7	And they will be completely burned with fire in 
2SA.23.8	These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains, he was 
2SA.23.9	and after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there to battle and the men of Israel had withdrawn. 
2SA.23.10	He arose and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary and clung to the sword, and the L
2SA.23.11	Now after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered into a troop where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the people fled from the Philistines. 
2SA.23.12	But he took his stand in the midst of the plot, defended it and struck the Philistines; and the L
2SA.23.13	Then three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam, while the troop of the Philistines was camping in the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.23.14	David was then in the stronghold, while the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. 
2SA.23.15	David had a craving and said, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate!” 
2SA.23.16	So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water from the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and took 
2SA.23.17	and he said, “Be it far from me, O L
2SA.23.18	Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. And he swung his spear against three hundred and killed 
2SA.23.19	He was most honored of the thirty, therefore he became their commander; however, he did not attain to the three.
2SA.23.20	Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two 
2SA.23.21	He killed an Egyptian, an impressive man. Now the Egyptian 
2SA.23.22	These 
2SA.23.23	He was honored among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David appointed him over his guard.
2SA.23.24	Asahel the brother of Joab was among the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
2SA.23.25	Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, 
2SA.23.26	Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, 
2SA.23.27	Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 
2SA.23.28	Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, 
2SA.23.29	Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin, 
2SA.23.30	Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash, 
2SA.23.31	Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, 
2SA.23.32	Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, 
2SA.23.33	Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite, 
2SA.23.34	Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, 
2SA.23.35	Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, 
2SA.23.36	Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 
2SA.23.37	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 
2SA.23.38	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
2SA.23.39	Uriah the Hittite; thirty-seven in all.
2SA.24.1	Now again the anger of the L
2SA.24.2	The king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him, “Go about now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and register the people, that I may know the number of the people.” 
2SA.24.3	But Joab said to the king, “Now may the L
2SA.24.4	Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to register the people of Israel. 
2SA.24.5	They crossed the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad and toward Jazer. 
2SA.24.6	Then they came to Gilead and to 
2SA.24.7	and came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites, and they went out to the south of Judah, 
2SA.24.8	So when they had gone about through the whole land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
2SA.24.9	And Joab gave the number of the registration of the people to the king; and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
2SA.24.10	Now David’s heart troubled him after he had numbered the people. So David said to the L
2SA.24.11	When David arose in the morning, the word of the L
2SA.24.12	“Go and speak to David, ‘Thus the L
2SA.24.13	So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, “Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ pestilence in your land? Now consider and see what answer I shall return to Him who sent me.” 
2SA.24.14	Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Let us now fall into the hand of the L
2SA.24.15	So the L
2SA.24.16	When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the L
2SA.24.17	Then David spoke to the L
2SA.24.18	So Gad came to David that day and said to him, “Go up, erect an altar to the L
2SA.24.19	David went up according to the word of Gad, just as the L
2SA.24.20	Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants crossing over toward him; and Araunah went out and bowed his face to the ground before the king. 
2SA.24.21	Then Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” And David said, “To buy the threshing floor from you, in order to build an altar to the L
2SA.24.22	Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what is good in his sight. Look, the oxen for the burnt offering, the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood. 
2SA.24.23	Everything, O king, Araunah gives to the king.” And Araunah said to the king, “May the L
2SA.24.24	However, the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will surely buy 
2SA.24.25	David built there an altar to the L
1KI.1.1	Now King David was old, advanced in age; and they covered him with clothes, but he could not keep warm. 
1KI.1.2	So his servants said to him, “Let them seek a young virgin for my lord the king, and let her attend the king and become his nurse; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm.” 
1KI.1.3	So they searched for a beautiful girl throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 
1KI.1.4	The girl was very beautiful; and she became the king’s nurse and served him, but the king did not cohabit with her.
1KI.1.5	Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king.” So he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen with fifty men to run before him. 
1KI.1.6	His father had never crossed him at any time by asking, “Why have you done so?” And he was also a very handsome man, and he was born after Absalom. 
1KI.1.7	He had conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest; and following Adonijah they helped him. 
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
1KI.1.9	Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the 
1KI.1.10	But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, and Solomon his brother.
1KI.1.11	Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know 
1KI.1.12	So now come, please let me give you counsel and save your life and the life of your son Solomon. 
1KI.1.13	Go at once to King David and say to him, ‘Have you not, my lord, O king, sworn to your maidservant, saying, “Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?’ 
1KI.1.14	Behold, while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.”
1KI.1.15	So Bathsheba went in to the king in the bedroom. Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king. 
1KI.1.16	Then Bathsheba bowed and prostrated herself before the king. And the king said, “What do you wish?” 
1KI.1.17	She said to him, “My lord, you swore to your maidservant by the L
1KI.1.18	Now, behold, Adonijah is king; and now, my lord the king, you do not know 
1KI.1.19	He has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant. 
1KI.1.20	As for you now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
1KI.1.21	Otherwise it will come about, as soon as my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be considered offenders.”
1KI.1.22	Behold, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. 
1KI.1.23	They told the king, saying, “Here is Nathan the prophet.” And when he came in before the king, he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground. 
1KI.1.24	Then Nathan said, “My lord the king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne’? 
1KI.1.25	For he has gone down today and has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons and the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest, and behold, they are eating and drinking before him; and they say, ‘
1KI.1.26	But me, 
1KI.1.27	Has this thing been done by my lord the king, and you have not shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”
1KI.1.28	Then King David said, “Call Bathsheba to me.” And she came into the king’s presence and stood before the king. 
1KI.1.29	The king vowed and said, “As the L
1KI.1.30	surely as I vowed to you by the L
1KI.1.31	Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, and prostrated herself before the king and said, “May my lord King David live forever.”
1KI.1.32	Then King David said, “Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” And they came into the king’s presence. 
1KI.1.33	The king said to them, “Take with you the servants of your lord, and have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon. 
1KI.1.34	Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel, and blow the trumpet and say, ‘
1KI.1.35	Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne and be king in my place; for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.” 
1KI.1.36	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, “Amen! Thus may the L
1KI.1.37	As the L
1KI.1.38	So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon. 
1KI.1.39	Zadok the priest then took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, “
1KI.1.40	All the people went up after him, and the people were playing on flutes and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth shook at their noise.
1KI.1.41	Now Adonijah and all the guests who 
1KI.1.42	While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. Then Adonijah said, “Come in, for you are a valiant man and bring good news.” 
1KI.1.43	But Jonathan replied to Adonijah, “No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king. 
1KI.1.44	The king has also sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have made him ride on the king’s mule. 
1KI.1.45	Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon, and they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise which you have heard. 
1KI.1.46	Besides, Solomon has even taken his seat on the throne of the kingdom. 
1KI.1.47	Moreover, the king’s servants came to bless our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name and his throne greater than your throne!’ And the king bowed himself on the bed. 
1KI.1.48	The king has also said thus, ‘Blessed be the L
1KI.1.49	Then all the guests of Adonijah were terrified; and they arose and each went on his way. 
1KI.1.50	And Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, and he arose, went and took hold of the horns of the altar. 
1KI.1.51	Now it was told Solomon, saying, “Behold, Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon, for behold, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’ ” 
1KI.1.52	Solomon said, “If he is a worthy man, not one of his hairs will fall to the ground; but if wickedness is found in him, he will die.” 
1KI.1.53	So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself before King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”
1KI.2.1	As David’s time to die drew near, he charged Solomon his son, saying, 
1KI.2.2	“I am going the way of all the earth. Be strong, therefore, and show yourself a man. 
1KI.2.3	Keep the charge of the L
1KI.2.4	so that the L
1KI.2.5	“Now you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed; he also shed the blood of war in peace. And he put the blood of war on his belt about his waist, and on his sandals on his feet. 
1KI.2.6	So act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray hair go down to Sheol in peace. 
1KI.2.7	But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table; for they assisted me when I fled from Absalom your brother. 
1KI.2.8	Behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera the Benjamite, of Bahurim; now it was he who cursed me with a violent curse on the day I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the L
1KI.2.9	Now therefore, do not let him go unpunished, for you are a wise man; and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you will bring his gray hair down to Sheol with blood.”
1KI.2.10	Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. 
1KI.2.11	The days that David reigned over Israel 
1KI.2.12	And Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established.
1KI.2.13	Now Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, “Do you come peacefully?” And he said, “Peacefully.” 
1KI.2.14	Then he said, “I have something 
1KI.2.15	So he said, “You know that the kingdom was mine and that all Israel expected me to be king; however, the kingdom has turned about and become my brother’s, for it was his from the L
1KI.2.16	Now I am making one request of you; do not 
1KI.2.17	Then he said, “Please speak to Solomon the king, for he will not refuse you, that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife.” 
1KI.2.18	Bathsheba said, “Very well; I will speak to the king for you.”
1KI.2.19	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king arose to meet her, bowed before her, and sat on his throne; then he had a throne set for the king’s mother, and she sat on his right. 
1KI.2.20	Then she said, “I am making one small request of you; do not refuse me.” And the king said to her, “Ask, my mother, for I will not refuse you.” 
1KI.2.21	So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as a wife.” 
1KI.2.22	King Solomon answered and said to his mother, “And why are you asking Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him also the kingdom—for he is my older brother—even for him, for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah!” 
1KI.2.23	Then King Solomon swore by the L
1KI.2.24	Now therefore, as the L
1KI.2.25	So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him so that he died.
1KI.2.26	Then to Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to Anathoth to your own field, for you deserve to die; but I will not put you to death at this time, because you carried the ark of the Lord G
1KI.2.27	So Solomon dismissed Abiathar from being priest to the L
1KI.2.28	Now the news came to Joab, for Joab had followed Adonijah, although he had not followed Absalom. And Joab fled to the tent of the L
1KI.2.29	It was told King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of the L
1KI.2.30	So Benaiah came to the tent of the L
1KI.2.31	The king said to him, “Do as he has spoken and fall upon him and bury him, that you may remove from me and from my father’s house the blood which Joab shed without cause. 
1KI.2.32	The L
1KI.2.33	So shall their blood return on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever; but to David and his descendants and his house and his throne, may there be peace from the L
1KI.2.34	Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell upon him and put him to death, and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness. 
1KI.2.35	The king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in his place, and the king appointed Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.
1KI.2.36	Now the king sent and called for Shimei and said to him, “Build for yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, and do not go out from there to any place. 
1KI.2.37	For on the day you go out and cross over the brook Kidron, you will know for certain that you shall surely die; your blood shall be on your own head.” 
1KI.2.38	Shimei then said to the king, “The word is good. As my lord the king has said, so your servant will do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.
1KI.2.39	But it came about at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, “Behold, your servants are in Gath.” 
1KI.2.40	Then Shimei arose and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to look for his servants. And Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath. 
1KI.2.41	It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned. 
1KI.2.42	So the king sent and called for Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the L
1KI.2.43	Why then have you not kept the oath of the L
1KI.2.44	The king also said to Shimei, “You know all the evil which you acknowledge in your heart, which you did to my father David; therefore the L
1KI.2.45	But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the L
1KI.2.46	So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he went out and fell upon him so that he died.
1KI.3.1	Then Solomon formed a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter and brought her to the city of David until he had finished building his own house and the house of the L
1KI.3.2	The people were still sacrificing on the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the L
1KI.3.3	Now Solomon loved the L
1KI.3.4	The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place; Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. 
1KI.3.5	In Gibeon the L
1KI.3.6	Then Solomon said, “You have shown great lovingkindness to Your servant David my father, according as he walked before You in 
1KI.3.7	Now, O L
1KI.3.8	Your servant is in the midst of Your people which You have chosen, a great people who are too many to be numbered or counted. 
1KI.3.9	So give Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people to discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?”
1KI.3.10	It was pleasing in the sight of the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing. 
1KI.3.11	God said to him, “Because you have asked this thing and have not asked for yourself long life, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have you asked for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself discernment to understand justice, 
1KI.3.12	behold, I have done according to your words. Behold, I have given you a wise and discerning heart, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall one like you arise after you. 
1KI.3.13	I have also given you what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there will not be any among the kings like you all your days. 
1KI.3.14	If you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and commandments, as your father David walked, then I will prolong your days.”
1KI.3.15	Then Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and made peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.
1KI.3.16	Then two women who were harlots came to the king and stood before him. 
1KI.3.17	The one woman said, “Oh, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house; and I gave birth to a child while she 
1KI.3.18	It happened on the third day after I gave birth, that this woman also gave birth to a child, and we were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, only the two of us in the house. 
1KI.3.19	This woman’s son died in the night, because she lay on it. 
1KI.3.20	So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from beside me while your maidservant slept, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead son in my bosom. 
1KI.3.21	When I rose in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead; but when I looked at him carefully in the morning, behold, he was not my son, whom I had borne.” 
1KI.3.22	Then the other woman said, “No! For the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son.” But the first woman said, “No! For the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son.” Thus they spoke before the king.
1KI.3.23	Then the king said, “The one says, ‘This is my son who is living, and your son is the dead one’; and the other says, ‘No! For your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.’ ” 
1KI.3.24	The king said, “Get me a sword.” So they brought a sword before the king. 
1KI.3.25	The king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other.” 
1KI.3.26	Then the woman whose child 
1KI.3.27	Then the king said, “Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him. She is his mother.” 
1KI.3.28	When all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had handed down, they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice.
1KI.4.1	Now King Solomon was king over all Israel. 
1KI.4.2	These were his officials: Azariah the son of Zadok 
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha 
1KI.4.4	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada 
1KI.4.5	and Azariah the son of Nathan 
1KI.4.6	and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda 
1KI.4.7	Solomon had twelve deputies over all Israel, who provided for the king and his household; each man had to provide for a month in the year. 
1KI.4.8	These are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim; 
1KI.4.9	Ben-deker in Makaz and Shaalbim and Beth-shemesh and Elonbeth-hanan; 
1KI.4.10	Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (Socoh 
1KI.4.11	Ben-abinadab, 
1KI.4.12	Baana the son of Ahilud, 
1KI.4.13	Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (the towns of Jair, the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead were his: the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars 
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab the son of Iddo, 
1KI.4.15	Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also married Basemath the daughter of Solomon); 
1KI.4.16	Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth; 
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar; 
1KI.4.18	Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin; 
1KI.4.19	Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and 
1KI.4.20	Judah and Israel 
1KI.4.21	Now Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the 
1KI.4.22	Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty 
1KI.4.23	ten fat oxen, twenty pasture-fed oxen, a hundred sheep besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl. 
1KI.4.24	For he had dominion over everything west of the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings west of the River; and he had peace on all sides around about him. 
1KI.4.25	So Judah and Israel lived in safety, every man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. 
1KI.4.26	Solomon had 
1KI.4.27	Those deputies provided for King Solomon and all who came to King Solomon’s table, each in his month; they left nothing lacking. 
1KI.4.28	They also brought barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to the place where it should be, each according to his charge.
1KI.4.29	Now God gave Solomon wisdom and very great discernment and breadth of mind, like the sand that is on the seashore. 
1KI.4.30	Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. 
1KI.4.31	For he was wiser than all men, than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was 
1KI.4.32	He also spoke 3,000 proverbs, and his songs were 1,005. 
1KI.4.33	He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows on the wall; he spoke also of animals and birds and creeping things and fish. 
1KI.4.34	Men came from all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.
1KI.5.1	Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram had always been a friend of David. 
1KI.5.2	Then Solomon sent 
1KI.5.3	“You know that David my father was unable to build a house for the name of the L
1KI.5.4	But now the L
1KI.5.5	Behold, I intend to build a house for the name of the L
1KI.5.6	Now therefore, command that they cut for me cedars from Lebanon, and my servants will be with your servants; and I will give you wages for your servants according to all that you say, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”
1KI.5.7	When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, “Blessed be the L
1KI.5.8	So Hiram sent 
1KI.5.9	My servants will bring 
1KI.5.10	So Hiram gave Solomon as much as he desired of the cedar and cypress timber. 
1KI.5.11	Solomon then gave Hiram 20,000 kors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty kors of beaten oil; thus Solomon would give Hiram year by year. 
1KI.5.12	The L
1KI.5.13	Now King Solomon levied forced laborers from all Israel; and the forced laborers numbered 30,000 men. 
1KI.5.14	He sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in relays; they were in Lebanon a month 
1KI.5.15	Now Solomon had 70,000 transporters, and 80,000 hewers 
1KI.5.16	besides Solomon’s 3,300 chief deputies who 
1KI.5.17	Then the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with cut stones. 
1KI.5.18	So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites cut them, and prepared the timbers and the stones to build the house.
1KI.6.1	Now it came about in the four hundred and eightieth year after the sons of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the L
1KI.6.2	As for the house which King Solomon built for the L
1KI.6.3	The porch in front of the nave of the house 
1KI.6.4	Also for the house he made windows with 
1KI.6.5	Against the wall of the house he built stories encompassing the walls of the house around both the nave and the inner sanctuary; thus he made side chambers all around. 
1KI.6.6	The lowest story 
1KI.6.7	The house, while it was being built, was built of stone prepared at the quarry, and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any iron tool heard in the house while it was being built.
1KI.6.8	The doorway for the 
1KI.6.9	So he built the house and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar. 
1KI.6.10	He also built the stories against the whole house, each five cubits high; and they were fastened to the house with timbers of cedar.
1KI.6.11	Now the word of the L
1KI.6.12	“
1KI.6.13	I will dwell among the sons of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel.”
1KI.6.14	So Solomon built the house and finished it. 
1KI.6.15	Then he built the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house to the ceiling he overlaid 
1KI.6.16	He built twenty cubits on the rear part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling; he built 
1KI.6.17	The house, that is, the nave in front of 
1KI.6.18	There was cedar on the house within, carved 
1KI.6.19	Then he prepared an inner sanctuary within the house in order to place there the ark of the covenant of the L
1KI.6.20	The inner sanctuary 
1KI.6.21	So Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold. And he drew chains of gold across the front of the inner sanctuary, and he overlaid it with gold. 
1KI.6.22	He overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar which was by the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.
1KI.6.23	Also in the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high. 
1KI.6.24	Five cubits 
1KI.6.25	The other cherub 
1KI.6.26	The height of the one cherub 
1KI.6.27	He placed the cherubim in the midst of the inner house, and the wings of the cherubim were spread out, so that the wing of the one was touching the 
1KI.6.28	He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1KI.6.29	Then he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, inner and outer 
1KI.6.30	He overlaid the floor of the house with gold, inner and outer 
1KI.6.31	For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood, the lintel 
1KI.6.32	So 
1KI.6.33	So also he made for the entrance of the nave four-sided doorposts of olive wood 
1KI.6.34	and two doors of cypress wood; the two leaves of the one door turned on pivots, and the two leaves of the other door turned on pivots. 
1KI.6.35	He carved 
1KI.6.36	He built the inner court with three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams.
1KI.6.37	In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the L
1KI.6.38	In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished throughout all its parts and according to all its plans. So he was seven years in building it.
1KI.7.1	Now Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. 
1KI.7.2	He built the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was 100 
1KI.7.3	It was paneled with cedar above the side chambers which were on the 45 pillars, 15 in each row. 
1KI.7.4	 frames in three rows, and window was opposite window in three ranks. 
1KI.7.5	All the doorways and doorposts 
1KI.7.6	Then he made the hall of pillars; its length was 50 cubits and its width 30 cubits, and a porch 
1KI.7.7	He made the hall of the throne where he was to judge, the hall of judgment, and it was paneled with cedar from floor to floor.
1KI.7.8	His house where he was to live, the other court inward from the hall, was of the same workmanship. He also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom Solomon had married.
1KI.7.9	All these were of costly stones, of stone cut according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside; even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court.
1KI.7.10	The foundation was of costly stones, 
1KI.7.11	And above were costly stones, stone cut according to measure, and cedar. 
1KI.7.12	So the great court all around 
1KI.7.13	Now King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre. 
1KI.7.14	He was a widow’s son from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill for doing any work in bronze. So he came to King Solomon and performed all his work.
1KI.7.15	He fashioned the two pillars of bronze; eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of both. 
1KI.7.16	He also made two capitals of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits and the height of the other capital was five cubits. 
1KI.7.17	 nets of network and twisted threads of chainwork for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital. 
1KI.7.18	So he made the pillars, and two rows around on the one network to cover the capitals which were on the top of the pomegranates; and so he did for the other capital. 
1KI.7.19	The capitals which 
1KI.7.20	 capitals on the two pillars, even above 
1KI.7.21	Thus he set up the pillars at the porch of the nave; and he set up the right pillar and named it 
1KI.7.22	On the top of the pillars was lily design. So the work of the pillars was finished.
1KI.7.23	Now he made the sea of cast 
1KI.7.24	Under its brim gourds went around encircling it ten to a cubit, completely surrounding the sea; the gourds were in two rows, cast with the rest. 
1KI.7.25	It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; and the sea 
1KI.7.26	It was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, 
1KI.7.27	Then he made the ten stands of bronze; the length of each stand was four cubits and its width four cubits and its height three cubits. 
1KI.7.28	This was the design of the stands: they had borders, even borders between the 
1KI.7.29	and on the borders which were between the 
1KI.7.30	Now each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and its four feet had supports; beneath the basin 
1KI.7.31	Its opening inside the crown at the top 
1KI.7.32	The four wheels 
1KI.7.33	The workmanship of the wheels 
1KI.7.34	Now 
1KI.7.35	On the top of the stand 
1KI.7.36	He engraved on the plates of its stays and on its borders, cherubim, lions and palm trees, according to the clear space on each, with wreaths 
1KI.7.37	He made the ten stands like this: all of them had one casting, one measure and one form.
1KI.7.38	He made ten basins of bronze, one basin held forty baths; each basin 
1KI.7.39	Then he set the stands, five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea 
1KI.7.40	Now Hiram made the basins and the shovels and the bowls. So Hiram finished doing all the work which he performed for King Solomon 
1KI.7.41	the two pillars and the 
1KI.7.42	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals which 
1KI.7.43	and the ten stands with the ten basins on the stands; 
1KI.7.44	and the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea; 
1KI.7.45	and the pails and the shovels and the bowls; even all these utensils which Hiram made for King Solomon 
1KI.7.46	In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 
1KI.7.47	Solomon left all the utensils 
1KI.7.48	Solomon made all the furniture which 
1KI.7.49	and the lampstands, five on the right side and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs, of gold; 
1KI.7.50	and the cups and the snuffers and the bowls and the spoons and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, 
1KI.7.51	Thus all the work that King Solomon performed 
1KI.8.1	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers’ 
1KI.8.2	All the men of Israel assembled themselves to King Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. 
1KI.8.3	Then all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. 
1KI.8.4	They brought up the ark of the L
1KI.8.5	And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen they could not be counted or numbered. 
1KI.8.6	Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the L
1KI.8.7	For the cherubim spread 
1KI.8.8	But the poles were so long that the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place before the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen outside; they are there to this day. 
1KI.8.9	There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, where the L
1KI.8.10	It happened that when the priests came from the holy place, the cloud filled the house of the L
1KI.8.11	so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the L
1KI.8.12	Then Solomon said,
1KI.8.12	“The L
1KI.8.13	I have surely built You a lofty house,
1KI.8.13	A place for Your dwelling forever.”
1KI.8.14	Then the king faced about and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing. 
1KI.8.15	He said, “Blessed be the L
1KI.8.16	‘Since the day that I brought My people Israel from Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel 
1KI.8.17	Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of the L
1KI.8.18	But the L
1KI.8.19	Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who will be born to you, he will build the house for My name.’ 
1KI.8.20	Now the L
1KI.8.21	There I have set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the L
1KI.8.22	Then Solomon stood before the altar of the L
1KI.8.23	He said, “O L
1KI.8.24	who have kept with Your servant, my father David, that which You have promised him; indeed, You have spoken with Your mouth and have fulfilled it with Your hand as it is this day. 
1KI.8.25	Now therefore, O L
1KI.8.26	Now therefore, O God of Israel, let Your word, I pray, be confirmed which You have spoken to Your servant, my father David.
1KI.8.27	“But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You, how much less this house which I have built! 
1KI.8.28	Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication, O L
1KI.8.29	that Your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, toward the place of which You have said, ‘My name shall be there,’ to listen to the prayer which Your servant shall pray toward this place. 
1KI.8.30	Listen to the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place; hear in heaven Your dwelling place; hear and forgive.
1KI.8.31	“If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath, and he comes 
1KI.8.32	then hear in heaven and act and judge Your servants, condemning the wicked by bringing his way on his own head and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness.
1KI.8.33	“When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy, because they have sinned against You, if they turn to You again and confess Your name and pray and make supplication to You in this house, 
1KI.8.34	then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You gave to their fathers.
1KI.8.35	“When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain, because they have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name and turn from their sin when You afflict them, 
1KI.8.36	then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants and of Your people Israel, indeed, teach them the good way in which they should walk. And send rain on Your land, which You have given Your people for an inheritance.
1KI.8.37	“If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight 
1KI.8.38	whatever prayer or supplication is made by any man 
1KI.8.39	then hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive and act and render to each according to all his ways, whose heart You know, for You alone know the hearts of all the sons of men, 
1KI.8.40	that they may

1KI.8.42	(for they will hear of Your great name and Your mighty hand, and of Your outstretched arm); when he comes and prays toward this house, 
1KI.8.43	hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know Your name, to 
1KI.8.44	“When Your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way You shall send them, and they pray to the L
1KI.8.45	then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
1KI.8.46	“When they sin against You (for there is no man who does not sin) and You are angry with them and deliver them to an enemy, so that they take them away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near; 
1KI.8.47	if they take thought in the land where they have been taken captive, and repent and make supplication to You in the land of those who have taken them captive, saying, ‘We have sinned and have committed iniquity, we have acted wickedly’; 
1KI.8.48	if they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who have taken them captive, and pray to You toward their land which You have given to their fathers, the city which You have chosen, and the house which I have built for Your name; 
1KI.8.49	then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven Your dwelling place, and maintain their cause, 
1KI.8.50	and forgive Your people who have sinned against You and all their transgressions which they have transgressed against You, and make them 
1KI.8.51	(for they are Your people and Your inheritance which You have brought forth from Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace), 
1KI.8.52	that Your eyes may be open to the supplication of Your servant and to the supplication of Your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they call to You. 
1KI.8.53	For You have separated them from all the peoples of the earth as Your inheritance, as You spoke through Moses Your servant, when You brought our fathers forth from Egypt, O Lord G
1KI.8.54	When Solomon had finished praying this entire prayer and supplication to the L
1KI.8.55	And he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying:
1KI.8.56	“Blessed be the L
1KI.8.57	May the L
1KI.8.58	that He may incline our hearts to Himself, to walk in all His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His ordinances, which He commanded our fathers. 
1KI.8.59	And may these words of mine, with which I have made supplication before the L
1KI.8.60	so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the L
1KI.8.61	Let your heart therefore be wholly devoted to the L
1KI.8.62	Now the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifice before the L
1KI.8.63	Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the L
1KI.8.64	On the same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that 
1KI.8.65	So Solomon observed the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before the L
1KI.8.66	On the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king. Then they went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the L
1KI.9.1	Now it came about when Solomon had finished building the house of the L
1KI.9.2	that the L
1KI.9.3	The L
1KI.9.4	As for you, if you will walk before Me as your father David walked, in integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you 
1KI.9.5	then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised to your father David, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’
1KI.9.6	“But if you or your sons indeed turn away from following Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, 
1KI.9.7	then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them, and the house which I have consecrated for My name, I will cast out of My sight. So Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples. 
1KI.9.8	And this house will become a heap of ruins; everyone who passes by will be astonished and hiss and say, ‘Why has the L
1KI.9.9	And they will say, ‘Because they forsook the L
1KI.9.10	It came about at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the L
1KI.9.11	(Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold according to all his desire), then King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. 
1KI.9.12	So Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, and they did not please him. 
1KI.9.13	He said, “What are these cities which you have given me, my brother?” So they were called the land of 
1KI.9.14	And Hiram sent to the king 120 talents of gold.
1KI.9.15	Now this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon levied to build the house of the L
1KI.9.16	 Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burned it with fire, and killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and had given it 
1KI.9.17	So Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the lower Beth-horon 
1KI.9.18	and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land 
1KI.9.19	and all the storage cities which Solomon had, even the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and all that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land under his rule. 
1KI.9.20	 all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, who were not of the sons of Israel, 
1KI.9.21	their descendants who were left after them in the land whom the sons of Israel were unable to destroy utterly, from them Solomon levied forced laborers, even to this day. 
1KI.9.22	But Solomon did not make slaves of the sons of Israel; for they were men of war, his servants, his princes, his captains, his chariot commanders, and his horsemen.
1KI.9.23	These 
1KI.9.24	As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter came up from the city of David to her house which 
1KI.9.25	Now three times in a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the L
1KI.9.26	King Solomon also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. 
1KI.9.27	And Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, sailors who knew the sea, along with the servants of Solomon. 
1KI.9.28	They went to Ophir and took four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there, and brought 
1KI.10.1	Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the L
1KI.10.2	So she came to Jerusalem with a very large retinue, with camels carrying spices and very much gold and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart. 
1KI.10.3	Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from the king which he did not explain to her. 
1KI.10.4	When the queen of Sheba perceived all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, 
1KI.10.5	the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his waiters and their attire, his cupbearers, and his stairway by which he went up to the house of the L
1KI.10.6	Then she said to the king, “It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom. 
1KI.10.7	Nevertheless I did not believe the reports, until I came and my eyes had seen it. And behold, the half was not told me. You exceed 
1KI.10.8	How blessed are your men, how blessed are these your servants who stand before you continually 
1KI.10.9	Blessed be the L
1KI.10.10	She gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great 
1KI.10.11	Also the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir a very great 
1KI.10.12	The king made of the almug trees supports for the house of the L
1KI.10.13	King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire which she requested, besides what he gave her according to his royal bounty. Then she turned and went to her own land together with her servants.
1KI.10.14	Now the weight of gold which came in to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold, 
1KI.10.15	besides 
1KI.10.16	King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold, using 600 
1KI.10.17	 300 shields of beaten gold, using three minas of gold on each shield, and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 
1KI.10.18	Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with refined gold. 
1KI.10.19	 six steps to the throne and a round top to the throne at its rear, and arms on each side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms. 
1KI.10.20	Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on the one side and on the other; nothing like 
1KI.10.21	All King Solomon’s drinking vessels 
1KI.10.22	For the king had at sea the ships of Tarshish with the ships of Hiram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold and silver, ivory and apes and peacocks.
1KI.10.23	So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. 
1KI.10.24	All the earth was seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart. 
1KI.10.25	They brought every man his gift, articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.
1KI.10.26	Now Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 
1KI.10.27	The king made silver 
1KI.10.28	Also Solomon’s import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, 
1KI.10.29	A chariot was imported from Egypt for 600 
1KI.11.1	Now King Solomon loved many foreign women along with the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women, 
1KI.11.2	from the nations concerning which the L
1KI.11.3	He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines, and his wives turned his heart away. 
1KI.11.4	For when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart away after other gods; and his heart was not 
1KI.11.5	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and after Milcom the detestable idol of the Ammonites. 
1KI.11.6	Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the L
1KI.11.7	Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable idol of Moab, on the mountain which is east of Jerusalem, and for Molech the detestable idol of the sons of Ammon. 
1KI.11.8	Thus also he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.
1KI.11.9	Now the L
1KI.11.10	and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he did not observe what the L
1KI.11.11	So the L
1KI.11.12	Nevertheless I will not do it in your days for the sake of your father David, 
1KI.11.13	However, I will not tear away all the kingdom, 
1KI.11.14	Then the L
1KI.11.15	For it came about, when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, and had struck down every male in Edom 
1KI.11.16	(for Joab and all Israel stayed there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom), 
1KI.11.17	that Hadad fled to Egypt, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, while Hadad 
1KI.11.18	They arose from Midian and came to Paran; and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and assigned him food and gave him land. 
1KI.11.19	Now Hadad found great favor before Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. 
1KI.11.20	The sister of Tahpenes bore his son Genubath, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh. 
1KI.11.21	But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Send me away, that I may go to my own country.” 
1KI.11.22	Then Pharaoh said to him, “But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you are seeking to go to your own country?” And he answered, “Nothing; nevertheless you must surely let me go.”
1KI.11.23	God also raised up 
1KI.11.24	He gathered men to himself and became leader of a marauding band, after David slew them of 
1KI.11.25	So he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, along with the evil that Hadad 
1KI.11.26	Then Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, Solomon’s servant, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, also rebelled against the king. 
1KI.11.27	Now this was the reason why he rebelled against the king: Solomon built the Millo, 
1KI.11.28	Now the man Jeroboam was a valiant warrior, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, he appointed him over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph. 
1KI.11.29	It came about at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had clothed himself with a new cloak; and both of them were alone in the field. 
1KI.11.30	Then Ahijah took hold of the new cloak which was on him and tore it into twelve pieces. 
1KI.11.31	He said to Jeroboam, “Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus says the L
1KI.11.32	(but he will have one tribe, for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel), 
1KI.11.33	because they have forsaken Me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the sons of Ammon; and they have not walked in My ways, doing what is right in My sight and 
1KI.11.34	Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of My servant David whom I chose, who observed My commandments and My statutes; 
1KI.11.35	but I will take the kingdom from his son’s hand and give it to you, 
1KI.11.36	But to his son I will give one tribe, that My servant David may have a lamp always before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen for Myself to put My name. 
1KI.11.37	I will take you, and you shall reign over whatever you desire, and you shall be king over Israel. 
1KI.11.38	Then it will be, that if you listen to all that I command you and walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight by observing My statutes and My commandments, as My servant David did, then I will be with you and build you an enduring house as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you. 
1KI.11.39	Thus I will afflict the descendants of David for this, but not always.’ ” 
1KI.11.40	Solomon sought therefore to put Jeroboam to death; but Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt to Shishak king of Egypt, and he was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
1KI.11.41	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon and whatever he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon? 
1KI.11.42	Thus the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. 
1KI.11.43	And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David, and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place.
1KI.12.1	Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 
1KI.12.2	Now when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard 
1KI.12.3	Then they sent and called him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying, 
1KI.12.4	“Your father made our yoke hard; now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you.” 
1KI.12.5	Then he said to them, “Depart for three days, then return to me.” So the people departed.
1KI.12.6	King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, “How do you counsel 
1KI.12.7	Then they spoke to him, saying, “If you will be a servant to this people today, and will serve them and grant them their petition, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.” 
1KI.12.8	But he forsook the counsel of the elders which they had given him, and consulted with the young men who grew up with him and served him. 
1KI.12.9	So he said to them, “What counsel do you give that we may answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke which your father put on us’?” 
1KI.12.10	The young men who grew up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall say to this people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, now you make it lighter for us!’ But you shall speak to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins! 
1KI.12.11	Whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.’ ”
1KI.12.12	Then Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had directed, saying, “Return to me on the third day.” 
1KI.12.13	The king answered the people harshly, for he forsook the advice of the elders which they had given him, 
1KI.12.14	and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.” 
1KI.12.15	So the king did not listen to the people; for it was a turn 
1KI.12.16	When all Israel 
1KI.12.16	“What portion do we have in David?
1KI.12.16	To your tents, O Israel!
1KI.12.16	Now look after your own house, David!”
1KI.12.16	So Israel departed to their tents. 
1KI.12.17	But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
1KI.12.18	Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. 
1KI.12.19	So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
1KI.12.20	It came about when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, that they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. None but the tribe of Judah followed the house of David.
1KI.12.21	Now when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 chosen men who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 
1KI.12.22	But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 
1KI.12.23	“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and to the rest of the people, saying, 
1KI.12.24	‘Thus says the L
1KI.12.25	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived there. And he went out from there and built Penuel. 
1KI.12.26	Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom will return to the house of David. 
1KI.12.27	If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the L
1KI.12.28	So the king consulted, and made two golden calves, and he said to them, “It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold your gods, O Israel, that brought you up from the land of Egypt.” 
1KI.12.29	He set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan. 
1KI.12.30	Now this thing became a sin, for the people went 
1KI.12.31	And he made houses on high places, and made priests from among all the people who were not of the sons of Levi. 
1KI.12.32	Jeroboam instituted a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast which is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; thus he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves which he had made. And he stationed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made. 
1KI.12.33	Then he went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised in his own heart; and he instituted a feast for the sons of Israel and went up to the altar to burn incense.
1KI.13.1	Now behold, there came a man of God from Judah to Bethel by the word of the L
1KI.13.2	He cried against the altar by the word of the L
1KI.13.3	Then he gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign which the L
1KI.13.4	Now when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him.” But his hand which he stretched out against him dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself. 
1KI.13.5	The altar also was split apart and the ashes were poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the L
1KI.13.6	The king said to the man of God, “Please 
1KI.13.7	Then the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.” 
1KI.13.8	But the man of God said to the king, “If you were to give me half your house I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water in this place. 
1KI.13.9	For so it was commanded me by the word of the L
1KI.13.10	So he went another way and did not return by the way which he came to Bethel.
1KI.13.11	Now an old prophet was living in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the deeds which the man of God had done that day in Bethel; the words which he had spoken to the king, these also they related to their father. 
1KI.13.12	Their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” Now his sons had seen the way which the man of God who came from Judah had gone. 
1KI.13.13	Then he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him and he rode away on it. 
1KI.13.14	So he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak; and he said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” And he said, “I am.” 
1KI.13.15	Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat bread.” 
1KI.13.16	He said, “I cannot return with you, nor go with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water with you in this place. 
1KI.13.17	For a command 
1KI.13.18	He said to him, “I also am a prophet like you, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the L
1KI.13.19	So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house and drank water.
1KI.13.20	Now it came about, as they were sitting down at the table, that the word of the L
1KI.13.21	and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, “Thus says the L
1KI.13.22	but have returned and eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which He said to you, “Eat no bread and drink no water”; your body shall not come to the grave of your fathers.’ ” 
1KI.13.23	It came about after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, for the prophet whom he had brought back. 
1KI.13.24	Now when he had gone, a lion met him on the way and killed him, and his body was thrown on the road, with the donkey standing beside it; the lion also was standing beside the body. 
1KI.13.25	And behold, men passed by and saw the body thrown on the road, and the lion standing beside the body; so they came and told 
1KI.13.26	Now when the prophet who brought him back from the way heard 
1KI.13.27	Then he spoke to his sons, saying, “Saddle the donkey for me.” And they saddled 
1KI.13.28	He went and found his body thrown on the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside the body; the lion had not eaten the body nor torn the donkey. 
1KI.13.29	So the prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back, and he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn and to bury him. 
1KI.13.30	He laid his body in his own grave, and they mourned over him, 
1KI.13.31	After he had buried him, he spoke to his sons, saying, “When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. 
1KI.13.32	For the thing shall surely come to pass which he cried by the word of the L
1KI.13.33	After this event Jeroboam did not return from his evil way, but again he made priests of the high places from among all the people; any who would, he ordained, to be priests of the high places. 
1KI.13.34	This event became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to blot 
1KI.14.1	At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick. 
1KI.14.2	Jeroboam said to his wife, “Arise now, and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh; behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who spoke concerning me 
1KI.14.3	Take ten loaves with you, 
1KI.14.4	Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age. 
1KI.14.5	Now the L
1KI.14.6	When Ahijah heard the sound of her feet coming in the doorway, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam, why do you pretend to be another woman? For I am sent to you 
1KI.14.7	Go, say to Jeroboam, ‘Thus says the L
1KI.14.8	and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you—yet you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart, to do only that which was right in My sight; 
1KI.14.9	you also have done more evil than all who were before you, and have gone and made for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke Me to anger, and have cast Me behind your back— 
1KI.14.10	therefore behold, I am bringing calamity on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every male person, both bond and free in Israel, and I will make a clean sweep of the house of Jeroboam, as one sweeps away dung until it is all gone. 
1KI.14.11	Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs will eat. And he who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat; for the L
1KI.14.12	Now you, arise, go to your house. When your feet enter the city the child will die. 
1KI.14.13	All Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he alone of Jeroboam’s 
1KI.14.14	Moreover, the L
1KI.14.15	“For the L
1KI.14.16	He will give up Israel on account of the sins of Jeroboam, which he committed and with which he made Israel to sin.”
1KI.14.17	Then Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed and came to Tirzah. As she was entering the threshold of the house, the child died. 
1KI.14.18	All Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to the word of the L
1KI.14.19	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
1KI.14.20	The time that Jeroboam reigned 
1KI.14.21	Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the L
1KI.14.22	Judah did evil in the sight of the L
1KI.14.23	For they also built for themselves high places and 
1KI.14.24	There were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which the L
1KI.14.25	Now it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, that Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. 
1KI.14.26	He took away the treasures of the house of the L
1KI.14.27	So King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place, and committed them to the care of the commanders of the 
1KI.14.28	Then it happened as often as the king entered the house of the L
1KI.14.29	Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
1KI.14.30	There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. 
1KI.14.31	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijam his son became king in his place.
1KI.15.1	Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah. 
1KI.15.2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. 
1KI.15.3	He walked in all the sins of his father which he had committed before him; and his heart was not wholly devoted to the L
1KI.15.4	But for David’s sake the L
1KI.15.5	because David did what was right in the sight of the L
1KI.15.6	There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
1KI.15.7	Now the rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
1KI.15.8	And Abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son became king in his place.
1KI.15.9	So in the twentieth year of Jeroboam the king of Israel, Asa began to reign as king of Judah. 
1KI.15.10	He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. 
1KI.15.11	Asa did what was right in the sight of the L
1KI.15.12	He also put away the male cult prostitutes from the land and removed all the idols which his fathers had made. 
1KI.15.13	He also removed Maacah his mother from 
1KI.15.14	But the high places were not taken away; nevertheless the heart of Asa was wholly devoted to the L
1KI.15.15	He brought into the house of the L
1KI.15.16	Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 
1KI.15.17	Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent 
1KI.15.18	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold which were left in the treasuries of the house of the L
1KI.15.19	“
1KI.15.20	So Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah and all Chinneroth, besides all the land of Naphtali. 
1KI.15.21	When Baasha heard 
1KI.15.22	Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah—none was exempt—and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had built. And King Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.
1KI.15.23	Now the rest of all the acts of Asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. 
1KI.15.24	And Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.
1KI.15.25	Now Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. 
1KI.15.26	He did evil in the sight of the L
1KI.15.27	Then Baasha the son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against him, and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.
1KI.15.28	So Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah and reigned in his place. 
1KI.15.29	It came about as soon as he was king, he struck down all the household of Jeroboam. He did not leave to Jeroboam any persons alive, until he had destroyed them, according to the word of the L
1KI.15.30	 because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, because of his provocation with which he provoked the L
1KI.15.31	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1KI.15.32	There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1KI.15.33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel at Tirzah, 
1KI.15.34	He did evil in the sight of the L
1KI.16.1	Now the word of the L
1KI.16.2	“Inasmuch as I exalted you from the dust and made you leader over My people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made My people Israel sin, provoking Me to anger with their sins, 
1KI.16.3	behold, I will consume Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
1KI.16.4	Anyone of Baasha who dies in the city the dogs will eat, and anyone of his who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat.”
1KI.16.5	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1KI.16.6	And Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah, and Elah his son became king in his place. 
1KI.16.7	Moreover, the word of the L
1KI.16.8	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel at Tirzah, 
1KI.16.9	His servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he 
1KI.16.10	Then Zimri went in and struck him and put him to death in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and became king in his place. 
1KI.16.11	It came about when he became king, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he killed all the household of Baasha; he did not leave a single male, neither of his relatives nor of his friends.
1KI.16.12	Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha, according to the word of the L
1KI.16.13	for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned and which they made Israel sin, provoking the L
1KI.16.14	Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1KI.16.15	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days at Tirzah. Now the people were camped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. 
1KI.16.16	The people who were camped heard it said, “Zimri has conspired and has also struck down the king.” Therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp. 
1KI.16.17	Then Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah. 
1KI.16.18	When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king’s house and burned the king’s house over him with fire, and died, 
1KI.16.19	because of his sins which he sinned, doing evil in the sight of the L
1KI.16.20	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri and his conspiracy which he carried out, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1KI.16.21	Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; the 
1KI.16.22	But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. And Tibni died and Omri became king. 
1KI.16.23	In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel 
1KI.16.24	He bought the hill Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and named the city which he built Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.
1KI.16.25	Omri did evil in the sight of the L
1KI.16.26	For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in his sins which he made Israel sin, provoking the L
1KI.16.27	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did and his might which he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.28	So Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son became king in his place.
1KI.16.29	Now Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years. 
1KI.16.30	Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the L
1KI.16.31	It came about, as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he married Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went to serve Baal and worshiped him. 
1KI.16.32	So he erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which he built in Samaria. 
1KI.16.33	Ahab also made the 
1KI.16.34	In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho; he laid its foundations with the 
1KI.17.1	Now Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the L
1KI.17.2	The word of the L
1KI.17.3	“Go away from here and turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan. 
1KI.17.4	It shall be that you will drink of the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to provide for you there.” 
1KI.17.5	So he went and did according to the word of the L
1KI.17.6	The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he would drink from the brook. 
1KI.17.7	It happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
1KI.17.8	Then the word of the L
1KI.17.9	“Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.” 
1KI.17.10	So he arose and went to Zarephath, and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her and said, “Please get me a little water in a jar, that I may drink.” 
1KI.17.11	As she was going to get 
1KI.17.12	But she said, “As the L
1KI.17.13	Then Elijah said to her, “Do not fear; go, do as you have said, but make me a little bread cake from it first and bring 
1KI.17.14	For thus says the L
1KI.17.15	So she went and did according to the word of Elijah, and she and he and her household ate for 
1KI.17.16	The bowl of flour was not exhausted nor did the jar of oil become empty, according to the word of the L
1KI.17.17	Now it came about after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became sick; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. 
1KI.17.18	So she said to Elijah, “What do I have to do with you, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my iniquity to remembrance and to put my son to death!” 
1KI.17.19	He said to her, “Give me your son.” Then he took him from her bosom and carried him up to the upper room where he was living, and laid him on his own bed. 
1KI.17.20	He called to the L
1KI.17.21	Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and called to the L
1KI.17.22	The L
1KI.17.23	Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house and gave him to his mother; and Elijah said, “See, your son is alive.” 
1KI.17.24	Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the L
1KI.18.1	Now it happened 
1KI.18.2	So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine 
1KI.18.3	Ahab called Obadiah who 
1KI.18.4	for when Jezebel destroyed the prophets of the L
1KI.18.5	Then Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys; perhaps we will find grass and keep the horses and mules alive, and not have to kill some of the cattle.” 
1KI.18.6	So they divided the land between them to survey it; Ahab went one way by himself and Obadiah went another way by himself.
1KI.18.7	Now as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him, and he recognized him and fell on his face and said, “Is this you, Elijah my master?” 
1KI.18.8	He said to him, “It is I. Go, say to your master, ‘Behold, Elijah 
1KI.18.9	He said, “What sin have I committed, that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ahab to put me to death? 
1KI.18.10	As the L
1KI.18.11	And now you are saying, ‘Go, say to your master, “Behold, Elijah 
1KI.18.12	It will come about when I leave you that the Spirit of the L
1KI.18.13	Has it not been told to my master what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the L
1KI.18.14	And now you are saying, ‘Go, say to your master, “Behold, Elijah 
1KI.18.15	Elijah said, “As the L
1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
1KI.18.17	When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is this you, you troubler of Israel?” 
1KI.18.18	He said, “I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s house 
1KI.18.19	Now then send 
1KI.18.20	So Ahab sent 
1KI.18.21	Elijah came near to all the people and said, “How long 
1KI.18.22	Then Elijah said to the people, “I alone am left a prophet of the L
1KI.18.23	Now let them give us two oxen; and let them choose one ox for themselves and cut it up, and place it on the wood, but put no fire 
1KI.18.24	Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the L
1KI.18.25	So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one ox for yourselves and prepare it first for you are many, and call on the name of your god, but put no fire 
1KI.18.26	Then they took the ox which was given them and they prepared it and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon saying, “O Baal, answer us.” But there was no voice and no one answered. And they leaped about the altar which they made. 
1KI.18.27	It came about at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, “Call out with a loud voice, for he is a god; either he is occupied or gone aside, or is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and needs to be awakened.” 
1KI.18.28	So they cried with a loud voice and cut themselves according to their custom with swords and lances until the blood gushed out on them. 
1KI.18.29	When midday was past, they raved until the time of the offering of the 
1KI.18.30	Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the L
1KI.18.31	Elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the L
1KI.18.32	So with the stones he built an altar in the name of the L
1KI.18.33	Then he arranged the wood and cut the ox in pieces and laid 
1KI.18.34	And he said, “Fill four pitchers with water and pour 
1KI.18.35	The water flowed around the altar and he also filled the trench with water.
1KI.18.36	At the time of the offering of the

1KI.18.38	Then the fire of the L
1KI.18.39	When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, “The L
1KI.18.40	Then Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; do not let one of them escape.” So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
1KI.18.41	Now Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of the roar of a 
1KI.18.42	So Ahab went up to eat and drink. But Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he crouched down on the earth and put his face between his knees. 
1KI.18.43	He said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” So he went up and looked and said, “There is nothing.” And he said, “Go back” seven times. 
1KI.18.44	It came about at the seventh 
1KI.18.45	In a little while the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy shower. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel. 
1KI.18.46	Then the hand of the L
1KI.19.1	Now Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. 
1KI.19.2	Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So may the gods do to me and even more, if I do not make your

1KI.19.5	He lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold, there was an angel touching him, and he said to him, “Arise, eat.” 
1KI.19.6	Then he looked and behold, there was at his head a bread cake 
1KI.19.7	The angel of the L
1KI.19.8	So he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mountain of God.
1KI.19.9	Then he came there to a cave and lodged there; and behold, the word of the L
1KI.19.10	He said, “I have been very zealous for the L

1KI.19.17	It shall come about, the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall put to death. 
1KI.19.18	Yet I will leave 7,000 in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him.”
1KI.19.19	So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, while he was plowing with twelve pairs 
1KI.19.20	He left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, “Please let me kiss my father and my mother, then I will follow you.” And he said to him, “Go back again, for what have I done to you?” 
1KI.19.21	So he returned from following him, and took the pair of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh with the implements of the oxen, and gave 
1KI.20.1	Now Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all his army, and there 
1KI.20.2	Then he sent messengers to the city to Ahab king of Israel and said to him, “Thus says Ben-hadad, 
1KI.20.3	‘Your silver and your gold are mine; your most beautiful wives and children are also mine.’ ” 
1KI.20.4	The king of Israel replied, “It is according to your word, my lord, O king; I am yours, and all that I have.” 
1KI.20.5	Then the messengers returned and said, “Thus says Ben-hadad, ‘Surely, I sent to you saying, “You shall give me your silver and your gold and your wives and your children,” 
1KI.20.6	but about this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you, and they will search your house and the houses of your servants; and whatever is desirable in your eyes, they will take in their hand and carry away.’ ”
1KI.20.7	Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, “Please observe and see how this man is looking for trouble; for he sent to me for my wives and my children and my silver and my gold, and I did not refuse him.” 
1KI.20.8	All the elders and all the people said to him, “Do not listen or consent.” 
1KI.20.9	So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you sent for to your servant at the first I will do, but this thing I cannot do.’ ” And the messengers departed and brought him word again. 
1KI.20.10	Ben-hadad sent to him and said, “May the gods do so to me and more also, if the dust of Samaria will suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me.” 
1KI.20.11	Then the king of Israel replied, “Tell 
1KI.20.12	When 
1KI.20.13	Now behold, a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel and said, “Thus says the L
1KI.20.14	Ahab said, “By whom?” So he said, “Thus says the L
1KI.20.15	Then he mustered the young men of the rulers of the provinces, and there were 232; and after them he mustered all the people, 
1KI.20.16	They went out at noon, while Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the temporary shelters with the thirty-two kings who helped him. 
1KI.20.17	The young men of the rulers of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out and they told him, saying, “Men have come out from Samaria.” 
1KI.20.18	Then he said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive.”
1KI.20.19	So these went out from the city, the young men of the rulers of the provinces, and the army which followed them. 
1KI.20.20	They killed each his man; and the Arameans fled and Israel pursued them, and Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse with horsemen. 
1KI.20.21	The king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Arameans with a great slaughter.
1KI.20.22	Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel and said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself and observe and see what you have to do; for at the turn of the year the king of Aram will come up against you.”
1KI.20.23	Now the servants of the king of Aram said to him, “Their gods are gods of the mountains, therefore they were stronger than we; but rather let us fight against them in the plain, 
1KI.20.24	Do this thing: remove the kings, each from his place, and put captains in their place, 
1KI.20.25	and muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. Then we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they.” And he listened to their voice and did so.
1KI.20.26	At the turn of the year, Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. 
1KI.20.27	The sons of Israel were mustered and were provisioned and went to meet them; and the sons of Israel camped before them like two little flocks of goats, but the Arameans filled the country. 
1KI.20.28	Then a man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel and said, “Thus says the L
1KI.20.29	So they camped one over against the other seven days. And on the seventh day the battle was joined, and the sons of Israel killed 
1KI.20.30	But the rest fled to Aphek into the city, and the wall fell on 27,000 men who were left. And Ben-hadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamber.
1KI.20.31	His servants said to him, “Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings, please let us put sackcloth on our loins and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will save your life.” 
1KI.20.32	So they girded sackcloth on their loins and 
1KI.20.33	Now the men took this as an omen, and quickly catching his word said, “Your brother Ben-hadad.” Then he said, “Go, bring him.” Then Ben-hadad came out to him, and he took him up into the chariot. 
1KI.20.34	 said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I will restore, and you shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.” 
1KI.20.35	Now a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to another by the word of the L
1KI.20.36	Then he said to him, “Because you have not listened to the voice of the L
1KI.20.37	Then he found another man and said, “Please strike me.” And the man struck him, wounding him. 
1KI.20.38	So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes. 
1KI.20.39	As the king passed by, he cried to the king and said, “Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside and brought a man to me and said, ‘Guard this man; if for any reason he is missing, then your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.’ 
1KI.20.40	While your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.” And the king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided 
1KI.20.41	Then he hastily took the bandage away from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him that he was of the prophets. 
1KI.20.42	He said to him, “Thus says the L
1KI.20.43	So the king of Israel went to his house sullen and vexed, and came to Samaria.
1KI.21.1	Now it came about after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which 
1KI.21.2	Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden because it is close beside my house, and I will give you a better vineyard than it in its place; if you like, I will give you the price of it in money.” 
1KI.21.3	But Naboth said to Ahab, “The L
1KI.21.4	So Ahab came into his house sullen and vexed because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and ate no food.
1KI.21.5	But Jezebel his wife came to him and said to him, “How is it that your spirit is so sullen that you are not eating food?” 
1KI.21.6	So he said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you a vineyard in its place.’ But he said, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’ ” 
1KI.21.7	Jezebel his wife said to him, “Do you now reign over Israel? Arise, eat bread, and let your heart be joyful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”
1KI.21.8	So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name and sealed them with his seal, and sent letters to the elders and to the nobles who were living with Naboth in his city. 
1KI.21.9	Now she wrote in the letters, saying, “Proclaim a fast and seat Naboth at the head of the people; 
1KI.21.10	and seat two worthless men before him, and let them testify against him, saying, ‘You cursed God and the king.’ Then take him out and stone him to death.”
1KI.21.11	So the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent 
1KI.21.12	They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the people. 
1KI.21.13	Then the two worthless men came in and sat before him; and the worthless men testified against him, even against Naboth, before the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king.” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones. 
1KI.21.14	Then they sent 
1KI.21.15	When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.” 
1KI.21.16	When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
1KI.21.17	Then the word of the L
1KI.21.18	“Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth where he has gone down to take possession of it. 
1KI.21.19	You shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the L
1KI.21.20	Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, O my enemy?” And he answered, “I have found 
1KI.21.21	Behold, I will bring evil upon you, and will utterly sweep you away, and will cut off from Ahab every male, both bond and free in Israel; 
1KI.21.22	and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked 
1KI.21.23	Of Jezebel also has the L
1KI.21.24	The one belonging to Ahab, who dies in the city, the dogs will eat, and the one who dies in the field the birds of heaven will eat.”
1KI.21.25	Surely there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the L
1KI.21.26	He acted very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites had done, whom the L
1KI.21.27	It came about when Ahab heard these words, that he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and fasted, and he lay in sackcloth and went about despondently. 
1KI.21.28	Then the word of the L
1KI.21.29	“Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring the evil in his days, 
1KI.22.1	Three years passed without war between Aram and Israel. 
1KI.22.2	In the third year Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.3	Now the king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we are still doing nothing to take it out of the hand of the king of Aram?” 
1KI.22.4	And he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?” And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”
1KI.22.5	Moreover, Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the L
1KI.22.6	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle or shall I refrain?” And they said, “Go up, for the Lord will give 
1KI.22.7	But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not yet a prophet of the L
1KI.22.8	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the L
1KI.22.9	Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah son of Imlah.” 
1KI.22.10	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in 
1KI.22.11	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron for himself and said, “Thus says the L
1KI.22.12	All the prophets were prophesying thus, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper, for the L
1KI.22.13	Then the messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him saying, “Behold now, the words of the prophets are uniformly favorable to the king. Please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.” 
1KI.22.14	But Micaiah said, “As the L
1KI.22.15	When he came to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we refrain?” And he answered him, “Go up and succeed, and the L
1KI.22.16	Then the king said to him, “How many times must I adjure you to speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the L
1KI.22.17	So he said,
1KI.22.17	“I saw all Israel
1KI.22.17	Scattered on the mountains,
1KI.22.17	Like sheep which have no shepherd.
1KI.22.17	And the L
1KI.22.17	‘These have no master.
1KI.22.17	Let each of them return to his house in peace.’ ”
1KI.22.18	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”
1KI.22.19	Micaiah said, “Therefore, hear the word of the L
1KI.22.20	The L
1KI.22.21	Then a spirit came forward and stood before the L
1KI.22.22	The L
1KI.22.23	Now therefore, behold, the L
1KI.22.24	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, “How did the Spirit of the L
1KI.22.25	Micaiah said, “Behold, you shall see on that day when you enter an inner room to hide yourself.” 
1KI.22.26	Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son; 
1KI.22.27	and say, ‘Thus says the king, “Put this man in prison and feed him sparingly with bread and water until I return safely.” ’ ” 
1KI.22.28	Micaiah said, “If you indeed return safely the L
1KI.22.29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up against Ramoth-gilead. 
1KI.22.30	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle. 
1KI.22.31	Now the king of Aram had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, “Do not fight with small or great, but with the king of Israel alone.” 
1KI.22.32	So when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely it is the king of Israel,” and they turned aside to fight against him, and Jehoshaphat cried out. 
1KI.22.33	When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
1KI.22.34	Now a certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel in a joint of the armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and take me out of the fight; for I am severely wounded.” 
1KI.22.35	The battle raged that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot in front of the Arameans, and died at evening, and the blood from the wound ran into the bottom of the chariot. 
1KI.22.36	Then a cry passed throughout the army close to sunset, saying, “Every man to his city and every man to his country.”
1KI.22.37	So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria. 
1KI.22.38	They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots bathed themselves 
1KI.22.39	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did and the ivory house which he built and all the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
1KI.22.40	So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son became king in his place.
1KI.22.41	Now Jehoshaphat the son of Asa became king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
1KI.22.43	He walked in all the way of Asa his father; he did not turn aside from it, doing right in the sight of the L
1KI.22.44	Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
1KI.22.45	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might which he showed and how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
1KI.22.46	The remnant of the sodomites who remained in the days of his father Asa, he expelled from the land.
1KI.22.47	Now there was no king in Edom; a deputy was king. 
1KI.22.48	Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber. 
1KI.22.49	Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat was not willing. 
1KI.22.50	And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David, and Jehoram his son became king in his place.
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel. 
1KI.22.52	He did evil in the sight of the L
1KI.22.53	So he served Baal and worshiped him and provoked the L
2KI.1.1	Now Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. 
2KI.1.2	And Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber which 
2KI.1.3	But the angel of the L
2KI.1.4	Now therefore thus says the L
2KI.1.5	When the messengers returned to him he said to them, “Why have you returned?” 
2KI.1.6	They said to him, “A man came up to meet us and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you and say to him, “Thus says the L
2KI.1.7	He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came up to meet you and spoke these words to you?” 
2KI.1.8	They answered him, “
2KI.1.9	Then 
2KI.1.10	Elijah replied to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.” Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
2KI.1.11	So he again sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he said to him, “O man of God, thus says the king, ‘Come down quickly.’ ” 
2KI.1.12	Elijah replied to them, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.” Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
2KI.1.13	So he again sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. When the third captain of fifty went up, he came and bowed down on his knees before Elijah, and begged him and said to him, “O man of God, please let my life and the lives of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight. 
2KI.1.14	Behold fire came down from heaven and consumed the first two captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight.” 
2KI.1.15	The angel of the L
2KI.1.16	Then he said to him, “Thus says the L
2KI.1.17	So Ahaziah died according to the word of the L
2KI.1.18	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2KI.2.1	And it came about when the L
2KI.2.2	Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here please, for the L
2KI.2.3	Then the sons of the prophets who 
2KI.2.4	Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please stay here, for the L
2KI.2.5	The sons of the prophets who 
2KI.2.6	Then Elijah said to him, “Please stay here, for the L
2KI.2.7	Now fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite 
2KI.2.8	Elijah took his mantle and folded it together and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
2KI.2.9	When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken from you.” And Elisha said, “Please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.” 
2KI.2.10	He said, “You have asked a hard thing. 
2KI.2.11	As they were going along and talking, behold, 
2KI.2.12	Elisha saw 
2KI.2.13	He also took up the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and returned and stood by the bank of the Jordan. 
2KI.2.14	He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and struck the waters and said, “Where is the L
2KI.2.15	Now when the sons of the prophets who 
2KI.2.16	They said to him, “Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men, please let them go and search for your master; perhaps the Spirit of the L
2KI.2.17	But when they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send.” They sent therefore fifty men; and they searched three days but did not find him. 
2KI.2.18	They returned to him while he was staying at Jericho; and he said to them, “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not go’?”
2KI.2.19	Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold now, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad and the land is unfruitful.” 
2KI.2.20	He said, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” So they brought 
2KI.2.21	He went out to the spring of water and threw salt in it and said, “Thus says the L
2KI.2.22	So the waters have been purified to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.
2KI.2.23	Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up by the way, young lads came out from the city and mocked him and said to him, “Go up, you baldhead; go up, you baldhead!” 
2KI.2.24	When he looked behind him and saw them, he cursed them in the name of the L
2KI.2.25	He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	Now Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. 
2KI.3.2	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.3.3	Nevertheless, he clung to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin; he did not depart from them.
2KI.3.4	Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and used to pay the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams. 
2KI.3.5	But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
2KI.3.6	And King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel. 
2KI.3.7	Then he went and sent 
2KI.3.8	He said, “Which way shall we go up?” And he answered, “The way of the wilderness of Edom.”
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days’ journey, and there was no water for the army or for the cattle that followed them. 
2KI.3.10	Then the king of Israel said, “Alas! For the L
2KI.3.11	But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not a prophet of the L
2KI.3.12	Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the L
2KI.3.13	Now Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What do I have to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother.” And the king of Israel said to him, “No, for the L
2KI.3.14	Elisha said, “As the L
2KI.3.15	But now bring me a minstrel.” And it came about, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the L
2KI.3.16	He said, “Thus says the L
2KI.3.17	For thus says the L
2KI.3.18	This is but a slight thing in the sight of the L
2KI.3.19	Then you shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and fell every good tree and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.’ ” 
2KI.3.20	It happened in the morning about the time of offering the sacrifice, that behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
2KI.3.21	Now all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. And all who were able to put on armor and older were summoned and stood on the border. 
2KI.3.22	They rose early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite 
2KI.3.23	Then they said, “This is blood; the kings have surely fought together, and they have slain one another. Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!” 
2KI.3.24	But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites arose and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land, slaughtering the Moabites. 
2KI.3.25	Thus they destroyed the cities; and each one threw a stone on every piece of good land and filled it. So they stopped all the springs of water and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth 
2KI.3.26	When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him 700 men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not. 
2KI.3.27	Then he took his oldest son who was to reign in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. And there came great wrath against Israel, and they departed from him and returned to their own land.
2KI.4.1	Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, “Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the L
2KI.4.2	Elisha said to her, “What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?” And she said, “Your maidservant has nothing in the house except a jar of oil.” 
2KI.4.3	Then he said, “Go, borrow vessels at large for yourself from all your neighbors, 
2KI.4.4	And you shall go in and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour out into all these vessels, and you shall set aside what is full.” 
2KI.4.5	So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons; they were bringing 
2KI.4.6	When the vessels were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.” And he said to her, “There is not one vessel more.” And the oil stopped. 
2KI.4.7	Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debt, and you 
2KI.4.8	Now there came a day when Elisha passed over to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman, and she persuaded him to eat food. And so it was, as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat food. 
2KI.4.9	She said to her husband, “Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God passing by us continually. 
2KI.4.10	Please, let us make a little walled upper chamber and let us set a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; and it shall be, when he comes to us, 
2KI.4.11	One day he came there and turned in to the upper chamber and rested. 
2KI.4.12	Then he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite.” And when he had called her, she stood before him. 
2KI.4.13	He said to him, “Say now to her, ‘Behold, you have been careful for us with all this care; what can I do for you? Would you be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the army?’ ” And she answered, “I live among my own people.” 
2KI.4.14	So he said, “What then is to be done for her?” And Gehazi answered, “Truly she has no son and her husband is old.” 
2KI.4.15	He said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the doorway. 
2KI.4.16	Then he said, “At this season next year you will embrace a son.” And she said, “No, my lord, O man of God, do not lie to your maidservant.”
2KI.4.17	The woman conceived and bore a son at that season the next year, as Elisha had said to her.
2KI.4.18	When the child was grown, the day came that he went out to his father to the reapers. 
2KI.4.19	He said to his father, “My head, my head.” And he said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.” 
2KI.4.20	When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her lap until noon, and 
2KI.4.21	She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut 
2KI.4.22	Then she called to her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and return.” 
2KI.4.23	He said, “Why will you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath.” And she said, “
2KI.4.24	Then she saddled a donkey and said to her servant, “Drive and go forward; do not slow down the pace for me unless I tell you.” 
2KI.4.25	So she went and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel.
2KI.4.26	Please run now to meet her and say to her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?’ ” And she answered, “It is well.” 
2KI.4.27	When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to push her away; but the man of God said, “Let her alone, for her soul is troubled within her; and the L
2KI.4.28	Then she said, “Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say, ‘Do not deceive me’?”
2KI.4.29	Then he said to Gehazi, “Gird up your loins and take my staff in your hand, and go your way; if you meet any man, do not salute him, and if anyone salutes you, do not answer him; and lay my staff on the lad’s face.” 
2KI.4.30	The mother of the lad said, “As the L
2KI.4.31	Then Gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff on the lad’s face, but there was no sound or response. So he returned to meet him and told him, “The lad has not awakened.”
2KI.4.32	When Elisha came into the house, behold the lad was dead and laid on his bed. 
2KI.4.33	So he entered and shut the door behind them both and prayed to the L
2KI.4.34	And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth and his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands, and he stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child became warm. 
2KI.4.35	Then he returned and walked in the house once back and forth, and went up and stretched himself on him; and the lad sneezed seven times and the lad opened his eyes. 
2KI.4.36	He called Gehazi and said, “Call this Shunammite.” So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, “Take up your son.” 
2KI.4.37	Then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground, and she took up her son and went out.
2KI.4.38	When Elisha returned to Gilgal, 
2KI.4.39	Then one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine and gathered from it his lap full of wild gourds, and came and sliced them into the pot of stew, for they did not know 
2KI.4.40	So they poured 
2KI.4.41	But he said, “Now bring meal.” He threw it into the pot and said, “Pour 
2KI.4.42	Now a man came from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, “Give 
2KI.4.43	His attendant said, “What, will I set this before a hundred men?” But he said, “Give 
2KI.4.44	So he set 
2KI.5.1	Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man with his master, and highly respected, because by him the L
2KI.5.2	Now the Arameans had gone out in bands and had taken captive a little girl from the land of Israel; and she waited on Naaman’s wife. 
2KI.5.3	She said to her mistress, “I wish that my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his leprosy.” 
2KI.5.4	Naaman went in and told his master, saying, “Thus and thus spoke the girl who is from the land of Israel.” 
2KI.5.5	Then the king of Aram said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” He departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand 
2KI.5.6	He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, “And now as this letter comes to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may cure him of his leprosy.” 
2KI.5.7	When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, “Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man is sending 
2KI.5.8	It happened when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent 
2KI.5.9	So Naaman came with his horses and his chariots and stood at the doorway of the house of Elisha. 
2KI.5.10	Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh will be restored to you and 
2KI.5.11	But Naaman was furious and went away and said, “Behold, I thought, ‘He will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the L
2KI.5.12	Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage. 
2KI.5.13	Then his servants came near and spoke to him and said, “My father, had the prophet told you 
2KI.5.14	So he went down and dipped 
2KI.5.15	When he returned to the man of God with all his company, and came and stood before him, he said, “Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel; so please take a present from your servant now.” 
2KI.5.16	But he said, “As the L
2KI.5.17	Naaman said, “If not, please let your servant at least be given two mules’ load of earth; for your servant will no longer offer burnt offering nor will he sacrifice to other gods, but to the L
2KI.5.18	In this matter may the L
2KI.5.19	He said to him, “Go in peace.” So he departed from him some distance.
2KI.5.20	But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, “Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Aramean, by not receiving from his hands what he brought. As the L
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him and said, “Is all well?” 
2KI.5.22	He said, “All is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Behold, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothes.’ ” 
2KI.5.23	Naaman said, “Be pleased to take two talents.” And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes and gave them to two of his servants; and they carried 
2KI.5.24	When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand and deposited them in the house, and he sent the men away, and they departed. 
2KI.5.25	But he went in and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” And he said, “Your servant went nowhere.”
2KI.5.26	Then he said to him, “Did not my heart go 
2KI.5.27	Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever.” So he went out from his presence a leper 
2KI.6.1	Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “Behold now, the place before you where we are living is too limited for us. 
2KI.6.2	Please let us go to the Jordan and each of us take from there a beam, and let us make a place there for ourselves where we may live.” So he said, “Go.” 
2KI.6.3	Then one said, “Please be willing to go with your servants.” And he answered, “I shall go.” 
2KI.6.4	So he went with them; and when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees. 
2KI.6.5	But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, “Alas, my master! For it was borrowed.” 
2KI.6.6	Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” And when he showed him the place, he cut off a stick and threw 
2KI.6.7	He said, “Take it up for yourself.” So he put out his hand and took it.
2KI.6.8	Now the king of Aram was warring against Israel; and he counseled with his servants saying, “In such and such a place shall be my camp.” 
2KI.6.9	The man of God sent 
2KI.6.10	The king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God had told him; thus he warned him, so that he guarded himself there, more than once or twice.
2KI.6.11	Now the heart of the king of Aram was enraged over this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, “Will you tell me which of us is for the king of Israel?” 
2KI.6.12	One of his servants said, “No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.” 
2KI.6.13	So he said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and take him.” And it was told him, saying, “Behold, he is in Dothan.” 
2KI.6.14	He sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city.
2KI.6.15	Now when the attendant of the man of God had risen early and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was circling the city. And his servant said to him, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?” 
2KI.6.16	So he answered, “Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” 
2KI.6.17	Then Elisha prayed and said, “O L
2KI.6.18	When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the L
2KI.6.19	Then Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, nor is this the city; follow me and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” And he brought them to Samaria.
2KI.6.20	When they had come into Samaria, Elisha said, “O L
2KI.6.21	Then the king of Israel when he saw them, said to Elisha, “My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?” 
2KI.6.22	He answered, “You shall not kill 
2KI.6.23	So he prepared a great feast for them; and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the marauding bands of Arameans did not come again into the land of Israel.
2KI.6.24	Now it came about after this, that Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all his army and went up and besieged Samaria. 
2KI.6.25	There was a great famine in Samaria; and behold, they besieged it, until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty 
2KI.6.26	As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall a woman cried out to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!” 
2KI.6.27	He said, “If the L
2KI.6.28	And the king said to her, “What is the matter with you?” And she answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’ 
2KI.6.29	So we boiled my son and ate him; and I said to her on the next day, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him’; but she has hidden her son.” 
2KI.6.30	When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes—now he was passing by on the wall—and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth beneath on his body. 
2KI.6.31	Then he said, “May God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today.”
2KI.6.32	Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And 
2KI.6.33	While he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him and he said, “Behold, this evil is from the L
2KI.7.1	Then Elisha said, “Listen to the word of the L
2KI.7.2	The royal officer on whose hand the king was leaning answered the man of God and said, “Behold, if the L
2KI.7.3	Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said to one another, “Why do we sit here until we die? 
2KI.7.4	If we say, ‘We will enter the city,’ then the famine is in the city and we will die there; and if we sit here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us go over to the camp of the Arameans. If they spare us, we will live; and if they kill us, we will but die.” 
2KI.7.5	They arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Arameans; when they came to the outskirts of the camp of the Arameans, behold, there was no one there. 
2KI.7.6	For the Lord had caused the army of the Arameans to hear a sound of chariots and a sound of horses, 
2KI.7.7	Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents and their horses and their donkeys, 
2KI.7.8	When these lepers came to the outskirts of the camp, they entered one tent and ate and drank, and carried from there silver and gold and clothes, and went and hid 
2KI.7.9	Then they said to one another, “We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, but we are keeping silent; if we wait until morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king’s household.” 
2KI.7.10	So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and they told them, saying, “We came to the camp of the Arameans, and behold, there was no one there, nor the voice of man, only the horses tied and the donkeys tied, and the tents just as they were.” 
2KI.7.11	The gatekeepers called and told 
2KI.7.12	Then the king arose in the night and said to his servants, “I will now tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone from the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, ‘When they come out of the city, we will capture them alive and get into the city.’ ” 
2KI.7.13	One of his servants said, “Please, let some 
2KI.7.14	They took therefore two chariots with horses, and the king sent after the army of the Arameans, saying, “Go and see.”
2KI.7.15	They went after them to the Jordan, and behold, all the way was full of clothes and equipment which the Arameans had thrown away in their haste. Then the messengers returned and told the king.
2KI.7.16	So the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. Then a measure of fine flour 
2KI.7.17	Now the king appointed the royal officer on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate; but the people trampled on him at the gate, and he died just as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him. 
2KI.7.18	It happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, “Two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, will be 
2KI.7.19	Then the royal officer answered the man of God and said, “Now behold, if the L
2KI.7.20	And so it happened to him, for the people trampled on him at the gate and he died.
2KI.8.1	Now Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Arise and go with your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn; for the L
2KI.8.2	So the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God, and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. 
2KI.8.3	At the end of seven years, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went out to appeal to the king for her house and for her field. 
2KI.8.4	Now the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please relate to me all the great things that Elisha has done.” 
2KI.8.5	As he was relating to the king how he had restored to life the one who was dead, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and for her field. And Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, this is the woman and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.” 
2KI.8.6	When the king asked the woman, she related 
2KI.8.7	Then Elisha came to Damascus. Now Ben-hadad king of Aram was sick, and it was told him, saying, “The man of God has come here.” 
2KI.8.8	The king said to Hazael, “Take a gift in your hand and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the L
2KI.8.9	So Hazael went to meet him and took a gift in his hand, even every kind of good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ loads; and he came and stood before him and said, “Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent me to you, saying, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’ ” 
2KI.8.10	Then Elisha said to him, “Go, say to him, ‘You will surely recover,’ but the L
2KI.8.11	He fixed his gaze steadily 
2KI.8.12	Hazael said, “Why does my lord weep?” Then he answered, “Because I know the evil that you will do to the sons of Israel: their strongholds you will set on fire, and their young men you will kill with the sword, and their little ones you will dash in pieces, and their women with child you will rip up.” 
2KI.8.13	Then Hazael said, “But what is your servant, 
2KI.8.14	So he departed from Elisha and returned to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he answered, “He told me that you would surely recover.” 
2KI.8.15	On the following day, he took the cover and dipped it in water and spread it on his face, so that he died. And Hazael became king in his place.
2KI.8.16	Now in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then the king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah became king. 
2KI.8.17	He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
2KI.8.18	He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab became his wife; and he did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.8.19	However, the L
2KI.8.20	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. 
2KI.8.21	Then Joram crossed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him. And he arose by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots; but 
2KI.8.22	So Edom revolted against Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time. 
2KI.8.23	The rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2KI.8.24	So Joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son became king in his place.
2KI.8.25	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.8.26	Ahaziah 
2KI.8.27	He walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.8.28	Then he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead, and the Arameans wounded Joram. 
2KI.8.29	So King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was sick.
2KI.9.1	Now Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, “Gird up your loins, and take this flask of oil in your hand and go to Ramoth-gilead. 
2KI.9.2	When you arrive there, search out Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in and bid him arise from among his brothers, and bring him to an inner room. 
2KI.9.3	Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say, ‘Thus says the L
2KI.9.4	So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead. 
2KI.9.5	When he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting, and he said, “I have a word for you, O captain.” And Jehu said, “For which 
2KI.9.6	He arose and went into the house, and he poured the oil on his head and said to him, “Thus says the L
2KI.9.7	You shall strike the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the L
2KI.9.8	For the whole house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male person both bond and free in Israel. 
2KI.9.9	I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. 
2KI.9.10	The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and none shall bury 
2KI.9.11	Now Jehu came out to the servants of his master, and one said to him, “Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?” And he said to them, “You know 
2KI.9.12	They said, “It is a lie, tell us now.” And he said, “Thus and thus he said to me, ‘Thus says the L
2KI.9.13	Then they hurried and each man took his garment and placed it under him on the bare steps, and blew the trumpet, saying, “Jehu is king!”
2KI.9.14	So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Now Joram with all Israel was defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Aram, 
2KI.9.15	but King 
2KI.9.16	Then Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.
2KI.9.17	Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company.” And Joram said, “Take a horseman and send him to meet them and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’ ” 
2KI.9.18	So a horseman went to meet him and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’ ” And Jehu said, “What have you to do with peace? Turn behind me.” And the watchman reported, “The messenger came to them, but he did not return.” 
2KI.9.19	Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’ ” And Jehu answered, “What have you to do with peace? Turn behind me.” 
2KI.9.20	The watchman reported, “He came even to them, and he did not return; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.”
2KI.9.21	Then Joram said, “Get ready.” And they made his chariot ready. Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu and found him in the property of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
2KI.9.22	When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?” And he answered, “What peace, so long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?” 
2KI.9.23	So Joram reined about and fled and said to Ahaziah, “
2KI.9.24	And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his arms; and the arrow went through his heart and he sank in his chariot. 
2KI.9.25	Then 
2KI.9.26	‘Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,’ says the L
2KI.9.27	When Ahaziah the king of Judah saw 
2KI.9.28	Then his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his grave with his fathers in the city of David.
2KI.9.29	Now in the eleventh year of Joram, the son of Ahab, Ahaziah became king over Judah.
2KI.9.30	When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard 
2KI.9.31	As Jehu entered the gate, she said, “Is it well, Zimri, your master’s murderer?” 
2KI.9.32	Then he lifted up his face to the window and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” And two or three officials looked down at him.
2KI.9.33	He said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down, and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses, and he trampled her under foot. 
2KI.9.34	When he came in, he ate and drank; and he said, “See now to this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king’s daughter.” 
2KI.9.35	They went to bury her, but they found nothing more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands. 
2KI.9.36	Therefore they returned and told him. And he said, “This is the word of the L
2KI.9.37	and the corpse of Jezebel will be as dung on the face of the field in the property of Jezreel, so they cannot say, “This is Jezebel.” ’ ”
2KI.10.1	Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters and sent 
2KI.10.2	“Now, when this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons are with you, as well as the chariots and horses and a fortified city and the weapons, 
2KI.10.3	select the best and 
2KI.10.4	But they feared greatly and said, “Behold, the two kings did not stand before him; how then can we stand?” 
2KI.10.5	And the one who 
2KI.10.6	Then he wrote a letter to them a second time saying, “If you are on my side, and you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men, your master’s sons, and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow about this time.” Now the king’s sons, seventy persons, 
2KI.10.7	When the letter came to them, they took the king’s sons and slaughtered 
2KI.10.8	When the messenger came and told him, saying, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons,” he said, “Put them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.” 
2KI.10.9	Now in the morning he went out and stood and said to all the people, “You are innocent; behold, I conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these? 
2KI.10.10	Know then that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the L
2KI.10.11	So Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men and his acquaintances and his priests, until he left him without a survivor.
2KI.10.12	Then he arose and departed and went to Samaria. On the way while he was at 
2KI.10.13	Jehu met the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and said, “Who are you?” And they answered, “We are the relatives of Ahaziah; and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother.” 
2KI.10.14	He said, “Take them alive.” So they took them alive and killed them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two men; and he left none of them.
2KI.10.15	Now when he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab 
2KI.10.16	He said, “Come with me and see my zeal for the L
2KI.10.17	When he came to Samaria, he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of the L
2KI.10.18	Then Jehu gathered all the people and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much. 
2KI.10.19	Now, summon all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers and all his priests; let no one be missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal; whoever is missing shall not live.” But Jehu did it in cunning, so that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal. 
2KI.10.20	And Jehu said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.” And they proclaimed 
2KI.10.21	Then Jehu sent throughout Israel and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And when they went into the house of Baal, the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other. 
2KI.10.22	He said to the one who 
2KI.10.23	Jehu went into the house of Baal with Jehonadab the son of Rechab; and he said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search and see that there is here with you none of the servants of the L
2KI.10.24	Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings.
2KI.10.25	Then it came about, as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the royal officers, “Go in, kill them; let none come out.” And they killed them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the royal officers threw 
2KI.10.26	They brought out the 
2KI.10.27	They also broke down the 
2KI.10.28	Thus Jehu eradicated Baal out of Israel. 
2KI.10.29	However, 
2KI.10.30	The L

2KI.10.33	from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites and the Reubenites and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
2KI.10.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.10.35	And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son became king in his place. 
2KI.10.36	Now the time which Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria 
2KI.11.1	When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she rose and destroyed all the royal offspring. 
2KI.11.2	But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king’s sons who were being put to death, and placed him and his nurse in the bedroom. So they hid him from Athaliah, and he was not put to death. 
2KI.11.3	So he was hidden with her in the house of the L
2KI.11.4	Now in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of hundreds of the Carites and of the 
2KI.11.5	He commanded them, saying, “This is the thing that you shall do: one third of you, who come in on the sabbath and keep watch over the king’s house 
2KI.11.6	(one third also 
2KI.11.7	Two parts of you, 
2KI.11.8	Then you shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes within the ranks shall be put to death. And be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in.”
2KI.11.9	So the captains of hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each one of them took his men who were to come in on the sabbath, with those who were to go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. 
2KI.11.10	The priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and shields that 
2KI.11.11	The guards stood each with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and by the house, around the king. 
2KI.11.12	Then he brought the king’s son out and put the crown on him and 
2KI.11.13	When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard 
2KI.11.14	She looked and behold, the king was standing by the pillar, according to the custom, with the captains and the trumpeters beside the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, “Treason! Treason!” 
2KI.11.15	And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were appointed over the army and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks, and whoever follows her put to death with the sword.” For the priest said, “Let her not be put to death in the house of the L
2KI.11.16	So they seized her, and when she arrived at the horses’ entrance of the king’s house, she was put to death there.
2KI.11.17	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the L
2KI.11.18	All the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the L
2KI.11.19	He took the captains of hundreds and the Carites and the guards and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of the L
2KI.11.20	So all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet. For they had put Athaliah to death with the sword at the king’s house.
2KI.11.21	Jehoash was seven years old when he became king.
2KI.12.1	In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba. 
2KI.12.2	Jehoash did right in the sight of the L
2KI.12.3	Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
2KI.12.4	Then Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money of the sacred things which is brought into the house of the L
2KI.12.5	let the priests take it for themselves, each from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the 
2KI.12.6	But it came about that in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash the priests had not repaired the damages of the house. 
2KI.12.7	Then King Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the 
2KI.12.8	So the priests agreed that they would take no 
2KI.12.9	But Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid and put it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the L
2KI.12.10	When they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king’s scribe and the high priest came up and tied 
2KI.12.11	They gave the money which was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of the L
2KI.12.12	and to the masons and the stonecutters, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the damages to the house of the L
2KI.12.13	But there were not made for the house of the L
2KI.12.14	for they gave that to those who did the work, and with it they repaired the house of the L
2KI.12.15	Moreover, they did not require an accounting from the men into whose hand they gave the money to pay to those who did the work, for they dealt faithfully. 
2KI.12.16	The money from the guilt offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the L
2KI.12.17	Then Hazael king of Aram went up and fought against Gath and captured it, and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. 
2KI.12.18	Jehoash king of Judah took all the sacred things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own sacred things and all the gold that was found among the treasuries of the house of the L
2KI.12.19	Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.12.20	His servants arose and made a conspiracy and struck down Joash at the house of Millo 
2KI.12.21	For Jozacar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck 
2KI.13.1	In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu became king over Israel at Samaria, 
2KI.13.2	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.13.3	So the anger of the L
2KI.13.4	Then Jehoahaz entreated the favor of the L
2KI.13.5	The L
2KI.13.6	Nevertheless they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel sin, but walked in them; and the Asherah also remained standing in Samaria. 
2KI.13.7	For he left to Jehoahaz of the army not more than fifty horsemen and ten chariots and 10,000 footmen, for the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing. 
2KI.13.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.13.9	And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria; and Joash his son became king in his place.
2KI.13.10	In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria, 
2KI.13.11	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.13.12	Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.13.13	So Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne; and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
2KI.13.14	When Elisha became sick with the illness of which he was to die, Joash the king of Israel came down to him and wept over him and said, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” 
2KI.13.15	Elisha said to him, “Take a bow and arrows.” So he took a bow and arrows. 
2KI.13.16	Then he said to the king of Israel, “Put your hand on the bow.” And he put his hand 
2KI.13.17	He said, “Open the window toward the east,” and he opened 
2KI.13.18	Then he said, “Take the arrows,” and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground,” and he struck 
2KI.13.19	So the man of God was angry with him and said, “You should have struck five or six times, then you would have struck Aram until you would have destroyed 
2KI.13.20	Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites would invade the land in the spring of the year. 
2KI.13.21	As they were burying a man, behold, they saw a marauding band; and they cast the man into the grave of Elisha. And when the man touched the bones of Elisha he revived and stood up on his feet.
2KI.13.22	Now Hazael king of Aram had oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. 
2KI.13.23	But the L
2KI.13.24	When Hazael king of Aram died, Ben-hadad his son became king in his place. 
2KI.13.25	Then Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken in war from the hand of Jehoahaz his father. Three times Joash defeated him and recovered the cities of Israel.
2KI.14.1	In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah became king. 
2KI.14.2	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem. 
2KI.14.3	He did right in the sight of the L
2KI.14.4	Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. 
2KI.14.5	Now it came about, as soon as the kingdom was firmly in his hand, that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father. 
2KI.14.6	But the sons of the slayers he did not put to death, according to what is written in the book of the Law of Moses, as the L
2KI.14.7	He killed 
2KI.14.8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us face each other.” 
2KI.14.9	Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thorn bush which was in Lebanon sent to the cedar which was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ But there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trampled the thorn bush. 
2KI.14.10	You have indeed defeated Edom, and your heart has become proud. Enjoy your glory and stay at home; for why should you provoke trouble so that you, even you, would fall, and Judah with you?”
2KI.14.11	But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah. 
2KI.14.12	Judah was defeated by Israel, and they fled each to his tent. 
2KI.14.13	Then Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, 400 cubits. 
2KI.14.14	He took all the gold and silver and all the utensils which were found in the house of the L
2KI.14.15	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.14.16	So Jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son became king in his place.
2KI.14.17	Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel. 
2KI.14.18	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.14.19	They conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there. 
2KI.14.20	Then they brought him on horses and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. 
2KI.14.21	All the people of Judah took Azariah, who 
2KI.14.22	He built Elath and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers.
2KI.14.23	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel became king in Samaria, 
2KI.14.24	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.14.25	He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath as far as the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the L

2KI.14.29	And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel, and Zechariah his son became king in his place.
2KI.15.1	In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah became king. 
2KI.15.2	He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 
2KI.15.3	He did right in the sight of the L
2KI.15.4	Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. 
2KI.15.5	The L
2KI.15.6	Now the rest of the acts of Azariah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.15.7	And Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Jotham his son became king in his place.
2KI.15.8	In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in Samaria 
2KI.15.9	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.15.10	Then Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him and struck him before the people and killed him, and reigned in his place. 
2KI.15.11	Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.12	This is the word of the L
2KI.15.13	Shallum son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned one month in Samaria. 
2KI.15.14	Then Menahem son of Gadi went up from Tirzah and came to Samaria, and struck Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria, and killed him and became king in his place. 
2KI.15.15	Now the rest of the acts of Shallum and his conspiracy which he made, behold they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.16	Then Menahem struck Tiphsah and all who were in it and its borders from Tirzah, because they did not open 
2KI.15.17	In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem son of Gadi became king over Israel 
2KI.15.18	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.15.19	Pul, king of Assyria, came against the land, and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver so that his hand might be with him to strengthen the kingdom under his rule. 
2KI.15.20	Then Menahem exacted the money from Israel, even from all the mighty men of wealth, from each man fifty shekels of silver to pay the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria returned and did not remain there in the land. 
2KI.15.21	Now the rest of the acts of Menahem and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.15.22	And Menahem slept with his fathers, and Pekahiah his son became king in his place.
2KI.15.23	In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria, 
2KI.15.24	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.15.25	Then Pekah son of Remaliah, his officer, conspired against him and struck him in Samaria, in the castle of the king’s house with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of the Gileadites, and he killed him and became king in his place. 
2KI.15.26	Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah and all that he did, behold they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
2KI.15.27	In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria, 
2KI.15.28	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.15.29	In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came and captured Ijon and Abel-beth-maacah and Janoah and Kedesh and Hazor and Gilead and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria. 
2KI.15.30	And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and struck him and put him to death and became king in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. 
2KI.15.31	Now the rest of the acts of Pekah and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
2KI.15.32	In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah became king. 
2KI.15.33	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name 
2KI.15.34	He did what was right in the sight of the L
2KI.15.35	Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of the L
2KI.15.36	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.15.37	In those days the L
2KI.15.38	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and he was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Ahaz his son became king in his place.
2KI.16.1	In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham, king of Judah, became king. 
2KI.16.2	Ahaz 
2KI.16.3	But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and even made his son pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the L
2KI.16.4	He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.
2KI.16.5	Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to 
2KI.16.6	At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram, and cleared the Judeans out of Elath entirely; and the Arameans came to Elath and have lived there to this day.
2KI.16.7	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son; come up and deliver me from the hand of the king of Aram and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are rising up against me.” 
2KI.16.8	Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the L
2KI.16.9	So the king of Assyria listened to him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and captured it, and carried 
2KI.16.10	Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar which 
2KI.16.11	So Urijah the priest built an altar; according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, thus Urijah the priest made 
2KI.16.12	When the king came from Damascus, the king saw the altar; then the king approached the altar and went up to it, 
2KI.16.13	and burned his burnt offering and his meal offering, and poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar. 
2KI.16.14	The bronze altar, which 
2KI.16.15	Then King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, “Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meal offering and the king’s burnt offering and his meal offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their meal offering and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice. But the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire 
2KI.16.16	So Urijah the priest did according to all that King Ahaz commanded.
2KI.16.17	Then King Ahaz cut off the borders of the stands, and removed the laver from them; he also took down the sea from the bronze oxen which were under it and put it on a pavement of stone. 
2KI.16.18	The covered way for the sabbath which they had built in the house, and the outer entry of the king, he removed from the house of the L
2KI.16.19	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.16.20	So Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and his son Hezekiah reigned in his place.
2KI.17.1	In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah became king over Israel in Samaria, 
2KI.17.2	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.17.3	Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him, and Hoshea became his servant and paid him tribute. 
2KI.17.4	But the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea, who had sent messengers to So king of Egypt and had offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as 
2KI.17.5	Then the king of Assyria invaded the whole land and went up to Samaria and besieged it three years.
2KI.17.6	In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and carried Israel away into exile to Assyria, and settled them in Halah and Habor, 
2KI.17.7	Now 
2KI.17.8	and walked in the customs of the nations whom the L
2KI.17.9	The sons of Israel did things secretly which were not right against the L
2KI.17.10	They set for themselves 
2KI.17.11	and there they burned incense on all the high places as the nations 
2KI.17.12	They served idols, concerning which the L
2KI.17.13	Yet the L
2KI.17.14	However, they did not listen, but stiffened their neck like their fathers, who did not believe in the L
2KI.17.15	They rejected His statutes and His covenant which He made with their fathers and His warnings with which He warned them. And they followed vanity and became vain, and 
2KI.17.16	They forsook all the commandments of the L
2KI.17.17	Then they made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire, and practiced divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the L
2KI.17.18	So the L
2KI.17.19	Also Judah did not keep the commandments of the L
2KI.17.20	The L
2KI.17.21	When He had torn Israel from the house of David, they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. Then Jeroboam drove Israel away from following the L
2KI.17.22	The sons of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them 
2KI.17.23	until the L
2KI.17.24	The king of Assyria brought 
2KI.17.25	At the beginning of their living there, they did not fear the L
2KI.17.26	So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations whom you have carried away into exile in the cities of Samaria do not know the custom of the god of the land; so he has sent lions among them, and behold, they kill them because they do not know the custom of the god of the land.”
2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Take there one of the priests whom you carried away into exile and let him go and live there; and let him teach them the custom of the god of the land.” 
2KI.17.28	So one of the priests whom they had carried away into exile from Samaria came and lived at Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the L
2KI.17.29	But every nation still made gods of its own and put them in the houses of the high places which the people of Samaria had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived. 
2KI.17.30	The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, 
2KI.17.31	and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim. 
2KI.17.32	They also feared the L
2KI.17.33	They feared the L

2KI.17.38	The covenant that I have made with you, you shall not forget, nor shall you fear other gods. 
2KI.17.39	But the L

2KI.17.41	So while these nations feared the L
2KI.18.1	Now it came about in the third year of Hoshea, the son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah became king. 
2KI.18.2	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah. 
2KI.18.3	He did right in the sight of the L
2KI.18.4	He removed the high places and broke down the 
2KI.18.5	He trusted in the L
2KI.18.6	For he clung to the L
2KI.18.7	And the L
2KI.18.8	He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city.
2KI.18.9	Now in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it. 
2KI.18.10	At the end of three years they captured it; in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was captured. 
2KI.18.11	Then the king of Assyria carried Israel away into exile to Assyria, and put them in Halah and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes, 
2KI.18.12	because they did not obey the voice of the L
2KI.18.13	Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them. 
2KI.18.14	Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have done wrong. Withdraw from me; whatever you impose on me I will bear.” So the king of Assyria required of Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. 
2KI.18.15	Hezekiah gave 
2KI.18.16	At that time Hezekiah cut off 
2KI.18.17	Then the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a large army to Jerusalem. So they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they went up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway of the 
2KI.18.18	When they called to the king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came out to them.
2KI.18.19	Then Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, “What is this confidence that you have? 
2KI.18.20	You say (but

2KI.18.23	Now therefore, come, make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. 
2KI.18.24	How then can you repulse one official of the least of my master’s servants, and rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
2KI.18.25	Have I now come up without the L
2KI.18.26	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, “Speak now to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand 
2KI.18.27	But Rabshakeh said to them, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words, 
2KI.18.28	Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean, saying, “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
2KI.18.29	Thus says the king, ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you from my hand; 
2KI.18.30	nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the L
2KI.18.31	Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria, “Make your peace with me and come out to me, and eat each of his vine and each of his fig tree and drink each of the waters of his own cistern, 
2KI.18.32	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey, that you may live and not die.” But do not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you, saying, “The L
2KI.18.33	Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? 
2KI.18.34	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand? 
2KI.18.35	Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their land from my hand, that the L
2KI.18.36	But the people were silent and answered him not a word, for the king’s commandment was, “Do not answer him.” 
2KI.18.37	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
2KI.19.1	And when King Hezekiah heard 
2KI.19.2	Then he sent Eliakim who was over the household with Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 
2KI.19.3	They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day of distress, rebuke, and rejection; for children have come to birth and there is no strength to

2KI.19.5	So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
2KI.19.6	Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to your master, ‘Thus says the L
2KI.19.7	Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.” ’ ”
2KI.19.8	Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish. 
2KI.19.9	When he heard 
2KI.19.10	“Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you saying, “Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” 
2KI.19.11	Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them completely. So will you be spared? 
2KI.19.12	Did the gods of those nations which my fathers destroyed deliver them, 
2KI.19.13	Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and 
2KI.19.14	Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went up to the house of the L
2KI.19.15	Hezekiah prayed before the L
2KI.19.16	Incline Your ear, O L
2KI.19.17	Truly, O L
2KI.19.18	and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them. 
2KI.19.19	Now, O L
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying, “Thus says the L
2KI.19.21	This is the word that the L
2KI.19.21	‘She has despised you and mocked you,
2KI.19.21	The virgin daughter of Zion;
2KI.19.21	She has shaken 
2KI.19.21	The daughter of Jerusalem!
2KI.19.22	Whom have you reproached and blasphemed?
2KI.19.22	And against whom have you raised 
2KI.19.22	And haughtily lifted up your eyes?
2KI.19.22	Against the Holy One of Israel!
2KI.19.23	Through your messengers you have reproached the Lord,
2KI.19.23	And you have said, “With my many chariots
2KI.19.23	I came up to the heights of the mountains,
2KI.19.23	To the remotest parts of Lebanon;
2KI.19.23	And I cut down its tall cedars 
2KI.19.23	And I entered its farthest lodging place, its thickest forest.
2KI.19.24	I dug 
2KI.19.24	And with the sole of my feet I dried up
2KI.19.24	All the rivers of Egypt.”
2KI.19.25	‘Have you not heard?
2KI.19.25	Long ago I did it;
2KI.19.25	From ancient times I planned it.
2KI.19.25	Now I have brought it to pass,
2KI.19.25	That you should turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
2KI.19.26	Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength,
2KI.19.26	They were dismayed and put to shame;
2KI.19.26	They were as the vegetation of the field and as the green herb,
2KI.19.26	As grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up.
2KI.19.27	But I know your sitting down,
2KI.19.27	And your going out and your coming in,
2KI.19.27	And your raging against Me.
2KI.19.28	Because of your raging against Me,
2KI.19.28	And because your arrogance has come up to My ears,
2KI.19.28	Therefore I will put My hook in your nose,
2KI.19.28	And My bridle in your lips,
2KI.19.28	And I will turn you back by the way which you came.
2KI.19.29	‘Then this shall be the sign for you: you will eat this year what grows of itself, in the second year what springs from the same, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. 
2KI.19.30	The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward. 
2KI.19.31	For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of 
2KI.19.32	‘Therefore thus says the L
2KI.19.33	By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he shall not come to this city,” ’ declares the L
2KI.19.34	‘For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.’ ”
2KI.19.35	Then it happened that night that the angel of the L
2KI.19.36	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned 
2KI.19.37	It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place.
2KI.20.1	In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, “Thus says the L
2KI.20.2	Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the L
2KI.20.3	“Remember now, O L
2KI.20.4	Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the L
2KI.20.5	“Return and say to Hezekiah the leader of My people, ‘Thus says the L
2KI.20.6	I will add fifteen years to your life, and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.” ’ ” 
2KI.20.7	Then Isaiah said, “Take a cake of figs.” And they took and laid 
2KI.20.8	Now Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What will be the sign that the L
2KI.20.9	Isaiah said, “This shall be the sign to you from the L
2KI.20.10	So Hezekiah answered, “It is easy for the shadow to decline ten steps; no, but let the shadow turn backward ten steps.” 
2KI.20.11	Isaiah the prophet cried to the L
2KI.20.12	At that time Berodach-baladan a son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick. 
2KI.20.13	Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all his treasure house, the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and the house of his armor and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. 
2KI.20.14	Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where have they come to you?” And Hezekiah said, “They have come from a far country, from Babylon.” 
2KI.20.15	He said, “What have they seen in your house?” So Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasuries that I have not shown them.”
2KI.20.16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the L
2KI.20.17	‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and all that your fathers have laid up in store to this day will be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left,’ says the L
2KI.20.18	‘Some of your sons who shall issue from you, whom you will beget, will be taken away; and they will become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.’ ” 
2KI.20.19	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the L
2KI.20.20	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his might, and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.20.21	So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh his son became king in his place.
2KI.21.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hephzibah. 
2KI.21.2	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.21.3	For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel had done, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them. 
2KI.21.4	He built altars in the house of the L
2KI.21.5	For he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the L
2KI.21.6	He made his son pass through the fire, practiced witchcraft and used divination, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the L
2KI.21.7	Then he set the carved image of Asherah that he had made, in the house of which the L
2KI.21.8	And I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them.” 
2KI.21.9	But they did not listen, and Manasseh seduced them to do evil more than the nations whom the L
2KI.21.10	Now the L
2KI.21.11	“Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, having done wickedly more than all the Amorites did who 
2KI.21.12	therefore thus says the L
2KI.21.13	I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. 
2KI.21.14	I will abandon the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies, and they will become as plunder and spoil to all their enemies; 
2KI.21.15	because they have done evil in My sight, and have been provoking Me to anger since the day their fathers came from Egypt, even to this day.’ ”
2KI.21.16	Moreover, Manasseh shed very much innocent blood until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah sin, in doing evil in the sight of the L
2KI.21.17	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did and his sin which he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.18	And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza, and Amon his son became king in his place.
2KI.21.19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name 
2KI.21.20	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.21.21	For he walked in all the way that his father had walked, and served the idols that his father had served and worshiped them. 
2KI.21.22	So he forsook the L
2KI.21.23	The servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his own house. 
2KI.21.24	Then the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place. 
2KI.21.25	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.26	He was buried in his grave in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son became king in his place.
2KI.22.1	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name 
2KI.22.2	He did right in the sight of the L
2KI.22.3	Now in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam the scribe, to the house of the L
2KI.22.4	“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest that he may count the money brought in to the house of the L
2KI.22.5	Let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the L
2KI.22.6	to the carpenters and the builders and the masons and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house. 
2KI.22.7	Only no accounting shall be made with them for the money delivered into their hands, for they deal faithfully.”
2KI.22.8	Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the L
2KI.22.9	Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought back word to the king and said, “Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the L
2KI.22.10	Moreover, Shaphan the scribe told the king saying, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it in the presence of the king.
2KI.22.11	When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. 
2KI.22.12	Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant saying, 
2KI.22.13	“Go, inquire of the L
2KI.22.14	So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter); and they spoke to her. 
2KI.22.15	She said to them, “Thus says the L
2KI.22.16	thus says the L
2KI.22.17	Because they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods that they might provoke Me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore My wrath burns against this place, and it shall not be quenched.” ’ 
2KI.22.18	But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the L
2KI.22.19	because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the L
2KI.22.20	“Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes will not see all the evil which I will bring on this place.” ’ ” So they brought back word to the king.
2KI.23.1	Then the king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. 
2KI.23.2	The king went up to the house of the L
2KI.23.3	The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the L
2KI.23.4	Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the doorkeepers, to bring out of the temple of the L
2KI.23.5	He did away with the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and in the surrounding area of Jerusalem, also those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and to the moon and to the constellations and to all the host of heaven. 
2KI.23.6	He brought out the Asherah from the house of the L
2KI.23.7	He also broke down the houses of the 
2KI.23.8	Then he brought all the priests from the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates which 
2KI.23.9	Nevertheless the priests of the high places did not go up to the altar of the L
2KI.23.10	He also defiled 
2KI.23.11	He did away with the horses which the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of the L
2KI.23.12	The altars which 
2KI.23.13	The high places which 
2KI.23.14	He broke in pieces the 
2KI.23.15	Furthermore, the altar that 
2KI.23.16	Now when Josiah turned, he saw the graves that 
2KI.23.17	Then he said, “What is this monument that I see?” And the men of the city told him, “It is the grave of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which you have done against the altar of Bethel.” 
2KI.23.18	He said, “Let him alone; let no one disturb his bones.” So they left his bones undisturbed with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria. 
2KI.23.19	Josiah also removed all the houses of the high places which 
2KI.23.20	All the priests of the high places who 
2KI.23.21	Then the king commanded all the people saying, “Celebrate the Passover to the L
2KI.23.22	Surely such a Passover had not been celebrated from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and of the kings of Judah. 
2KI.23.23	But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was observed to the L
2KI.23.24	Moreover, Josiah removed the mediums and the spiritists and the teraphim and the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the L
2KI.23.25	Before him there was no king like him who turned to the L
2KI.23.26	However, the L
2KI.23.27	The L
2KI.23.28	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.23.29	In his days Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates. And King Josiah went to meet him, and when 
2KI.23.30	His servants drove his body in a chariot from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father.
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
2KI.23.32	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.23.33	Pharaoh Neco imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and he imposed on the land a fine of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
2KI.23.34	Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz away and brought 
2KI.23.35	So Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land in order to give the money at the command of Pharaoh. He exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land, each according to his valuation, to give it to Pharaoh Neco.
2KI.23.36	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name 
2KI.23.37	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.24.1	In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant 
2KI.24.2	The L
2KI.24.3	Surely at the command of the L
2KI.24.4	and also for the innocent blood which he shed, for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; and the L
2KI.24.5	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2KI.24.6	So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son became king in his place. 
2KI.24.7	The king of Egypt did not come out of his land again, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates.
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name 
2KI.24.9	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.24.10	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon went up to Jerusalem, and the city came under siege. 
2KI.24.11	And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to the city, while his servants were besieging it. 
2KI.24.12	Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he and his mother and his servants and his captains and his officials. So the king of Babylon took him captive in the eighth year of his reign. 
2KI.24.13	He carried out from there all the treasures of the house of the L
2KI.24.14	Then he led away into exile all Jerusalem and all the captains and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths. None remained except the poorest people of the land.
2KI.24.15	So he led Jehoiachin away into exile to Babylon; also the king’s mother and the king’s wives and his officials and the leading men of the land, he led away into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
2KI.24.16	All the men of valor, seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths, one thousand, all strong and fit for war, and these the king of Babylon brought into exile to Babylon.
2KI.24.17	Then the king of Babylon made his uncle Mattaniah king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah.

1CH.10.2	The Philistines closely pursued Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan, Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul. 
1CH.10.3	The battle became heavy against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was wounded by the archers. 
1CH.10.4	Then Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, otherwise these uncircumcised will come and abuse me.” But his armor bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword and fell on it. 
1CH.10.5	When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword and died. 
1CH.10.6	Thus Saul died with his three sons, and all 
1CH.10.7	When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.
1CH.10.8	It came about the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.

1CH.11.4	Then David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, 
1CH.11.5	The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You shall not enter here.” Nevertheless David captured the stronghold of Zion (that is, the city of David). 
1CH.11.6	Now David had said, “Whoever strikes down a Jebusite first shall be chief and commander.” Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief. 
1CH.11.7	Then David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David. 
1CH.11.8	He built the city all around, from the

1CH.11.12	After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who 
1CH.11.13	He was with David at Pasdammim when the Philistines were gathered together there to battle, and there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled before the Philistines. 
1CH.11.14	They took their stand in the midst of the plot and defended it, and struck down the Philistines; and the L
1CH.11.15	Now three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam, while the army of the Philistines was camping in the valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.11.16	David was then in the stronghold, while the garrison of the Philistines 
1CH.11.17	David had a craving and said, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!” 
1CH.11.18	So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the well of Bethlehem which 
1CH.11.19	and he said, “Be it far from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of these men 
1CH.11.20	As for Abshai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the thirty, and he swung his spear against three hundred and killed them; and he had a name as well as the thirty.

1CH.12.15	These are the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks and they put to flight all those in the valleys, both to the east and to the west.
1CH.12.16	Then some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David. 
1CH.12.17	David went out to meet them, and said to them, “If you come peacefully to me to help me, my heart shall be united with you; but if to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers look on 
1CH.12.18	Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was the chief of the thirty, 
1CH.12.18	“
1CH.12.18	And with you, O son of Jesse!
1CH.12.18	Peace, peace to you,

1CH.12.34	Of Naphtali 
1CH.12.35	Of the Danites who could draw up in battle formation, 
1CH.12.36	Of Asher 
1CH.12.37	From the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites and the Gadites and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, 
1CH.12.38	All these, being men of war who could draw up in battle formation, came to Hebron with a perfect heart to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one mind to make David king. 
1CH.12.39	They were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their kinsmen had prepared for them. 
1CH.12.40	Moreover those who were near to them, 
1CH.13.1	Then David consulted with the captains of the thousands and the hundreds, even with every leader. 
1CH.13.2	David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if it is from the L
1CH.13.3	and let us bring back the ark of our God to us, for we did not seek it in the days of Saul.” 
1CH.13.4	Then all the assembly said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
1CH.13.5	So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. 
1CH.13.6	David and all Israel went up to Baalah, 
1CH.13.7	They carried the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. 
1CH.13.8	David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all 
1CH.13.9	When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, because the oxen nearly upset 
1CH.13.10	The anger of the L
1CH.13.11	Then David became angry because of the L
1CH.13.12	David was afraid of God that day, saying, “How can I bring the ark of God 
1CH.13.13	So David did not take the ark with him to the city of David, but took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 
1CH.13.14	Thus the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months; and the L
1CH.14.1	Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, masons and carpenters, to build a house for him. 
1CH.14.2	And David realized that the L
1CH.14.3	Then David took more wives at Jerusalem, and David became the father of more sons and daughters. 
1CH.14.4	These are the names of the children born 
1CH.14.5	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
1CH.14.6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
1CH.14.7	Elishama, Beeliada and Eliphelet.
1CH.14.8	When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David; and David heard of it and went out against them. 
1CH.14.9	Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.14.10	David inquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? And will You give them into my hand?” Then the L
1CH.14.11	So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there; and David said, “God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like the breakthrough of waters.” Therefore they named that place 
1CH.14.12	They abandoned their gods there; so David gave the order and they were burned with fire.
1CH.14.13	The Philistines made yet another raid in the valley. 
1CH.14.14	David inquired again of God, and God said to him, “You shall not go up after them; circle around behind them and come at them in front of the balsam trees. 
1CH.14.15	It shall be when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall go out to battle, for God will have gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.” 
1CH.14.16	David did just as God had commanded him, and they struck down the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even as far as Gezer. 
1CH.14.17	Then the fame of David went out into all the lands; and the L
1CH.15.1	Now 
1CH.15.2	Then David said, “No one is to carry the ark of God but the Levites; for the L
1CH.15.3	And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the L
1CH.15.4	David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: 
1CH.15.5	of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and 120 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.6	of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and 220 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.7	of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and 130 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.8	of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and 200 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.9	of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and 80 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.10	of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and 112 of his relatives.
1CH.15.11	Then David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel and Amminadab, 
1CH.15.12	and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ 
1CH.15.13	Because you did not 
1CH.15.14	So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the L
1CH.15.15	The sons of the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the L
1CH.15.16	Then David spoke to the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their relatives the singers, with instruments of music, harps, lyres, loud-sounding cymbals, to raise sounds of joy. 
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel, and from his relatives, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and from the sons of Merari their relatives, Ethan the son of Kushaiah, 
1CH.15.18	and with them their relatives of the second rank, Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom and Jeiel, the gatekeepers. 
1CH.15.19	So the singers, Heman, Asaph and Ethan 
1CH.15.20	and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah and Benaiah, with harps 
1CH.15.21	and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel and Azaziah, to lead with lyres tuned to the sheminith. 
1CH.15.22	Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was 
1CH.15.23	Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark. 
1CH.15.24	Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah also 
1CH.15.25	So 
1CH.15.26	Because God was helping the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the L
1CH.15.27	Now David was clothed with a robe of fine linen with all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers and Chenaniah the leader of the singing 
1CH.15.28	Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the L
1CH.15.29	It happened when the ark of the covenant of the L
1CH.16.1	And they brought in the ark of God and placed it inside the tent which David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. 
1CH.16.2	When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the L
1CH.16.3	He distributed to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread and a portion 
1CH.16.4	He appointed some of the Levites 
1CH.16.5	Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, 
1CH.16.6	and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests 
1CH.16.7	Then on that day David first assigned Asaph and his relatives to give thanks to the L
1CH.16.8	Oh give thanks to the L
1CH.16.8	Make known His deeds among the peoples.
1CH.16.9	Sing to Him, sing praises to Him;
1CH.16.10	Glory in His holy name;
1CH.16.10	Let the heart of those who seek the L
1CH.16.11	Seek the L
1CH.16.11	Seek His face continually.
1CH.16.12	Remember His wonderful deeds which He has done,
1CH.16.12	His marvels and the judgments from His mouth,
1CH.16.13	O seed of Israel His servant,
1CH.16.13	Sons of Jacob, His chosen ones!
1CH.16.14	He is the L
1CH.16.14	His judgments are in all the earth.
1CH.16.15	Remember His covenant forever,
1CH.16.15	The word which He commanded to a thousand generations,
1CH.16.16	And His oath to Isaac.
1CH.16.17	He also confirmed it to Jacob for a statute,
1CH.16.17	To Israel as an everlasting covenant,
1CH.16.18	Saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,
1CH.16.18	As the portion of your inheritance.”
1CH.16.19	When they were only a few in number,
1CH.16.19	Very few, and strangers in it,
1CH.16.20	And they wandered about from nation to nation,
1CH.16.20	And from 
1CH.16.21	He permitted no man to oppress them,
1CH.16.21	And He reproved kings for their sakes, 
1CH.16.22	“Do not touch My anointed ones,
1CH.16.22	And do My prophets no harm.”
1CH.16.23	Sing to the L
1CH.16.23	Proclaim good tidings of His salvation from day to day.
1CH.16.24	Tell of His glory among the nations,
1CH.16.24	His wonderful deeds among all the peoples.
1CH.16.25	For great is the L
1CH.16.25	He also is to be feared above all gods.
1CH.16.26	For all the gods of the peoples are idols,
1CH.16.26	But the L
1CH.16.27	Splendor and majesty are before Him,
1CH.16.27	Strength and joy are in His place.
1CH.16.28	Ascribe to the L
1CH.16.28	Ascribe to the L
1CH.16.29	Ascribe to the L
1CH.16.29	Bring an offering, and come before Him;
1CH.16.29	Worship the L
1CH.16.30	Tremble before Him, all the earth;
1CH.16.30	Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved.
1CH.16.31	Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
1CH.16.31	And let them say among the nations, “The L
1CH.16.32	Let the sea roar, and all it contains;
1CH.16.32	Let the field exult, and all that is in it.
1CH.16.33	Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the L
1CH.16.33	For He is coming to judge the earth.
1CH.16.34	O give thanks to the L
1CH.16.34	For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
1CH.16.35	Then say, “Save us, O God of our salvation,
1CH.16.35	And gather us and deliver us from the nations,
1CH.16.35	To give thanks to Your holy name,
1CH.16.35	And glory in Your praise.”
1CH.16.36	Blessed be the L
1CH.16.36	From everlasting even to everlasting.
1CH.16.36	Then all the people said, “Amen,” and praised the L
1CH.16.37	So he left Asaph and his relatives there before the ark of the covenant of the L
1CH.16.38	and Obed-edom with his 68 relatives; Obed-edom, also the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah as gatekeepers. 
1CH.16.39	 Zadok the priest and his relatives the priests before the tabernacle of the L
1CH.16.40	to offer burnt offerings to the L
1CH.16.41	With them 
1CH.16.42	And with them 
1CH.16.43	Then all the people departed each to his house, and David returned to bless his household.
1CH.17.1	And it came about, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I am dwelling in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the L
1CH.17.2	Then Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.”
1CH.17.3	It came about the same night that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
1CH.17.4	“Go and tell David My servant, ‘Thus says the L
1CH.17.5	for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day, but I have gone from tent to tent and from 
1CH.17.6	In all places where I have walked with all Israel, have I spoken a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, ‘Why have you not built for Me a house of cedar?’ ” ’ 
1CH.17.7	Now, therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the L
1CH.17.8	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth. 
1CH.17.9	I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and not be moved again; and the wicked will not waste them anymore as formerly, 
1CH.17.10	even from the day that I commanded judges 
1CH.17.11	When your days are fulfilled that you must go 
1CH.17.12	He shall build for Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. 
1CH.17.13	I will be his father and he shall be My son; and I will not take My lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him who was before you. 
1CH.17.14	But I will settle him in My house and in My kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever.” ’ ” 
1CH.17.15	According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
1CH.17.16	Then David the king went in and sat before the L
1CH.17.17	This was a small thing in Your eyes, O God; but You have spoken of Your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the standard of a man of high degree, O L
1CH.17.18	What more can David still 
1CH.17.19	O L
1CH.17.20	O L
1CH.17.21	And what one nation in the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself 
1CH.17.22	For Your people Israel You made Your own people forever, and You, O L
1CH.17.23	“Now, O L
1CH.17.24	Let Your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘The L
1CH.17.25	For You, O my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build for him a house; therefore Your servant has found 
1CH.17.26	Now, O L
1CH.17.27	And now it has pleased You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You; for You, O L
1CH.18.1	Now after this it came about that David defeated the Philistines and subdued them and took Gath and its towns from the hand of the Philistines. 
1CH.18.2	He defeated Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute.
1CH.18.3	David also defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah 
1CH.18.4	David took from him 1,000 chariots and 7,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers, and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved 
1CH.18.5	When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed 22,000 men of the Arameans. 
1CH.18.6	Then David put 
1CH.18.7	David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	Also from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a very large amount of bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the bronze utensils.
1CH.18.9	Now when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, 
1CH.18.10	he sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and had defeated him; for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou. And 
1CH.18.11	King David also dedicated these to the L
1CH.18.12	Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah defeated 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
1CH.18.13	Then he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the L
1CH.18.14	So David reigned over all Israel; and he administered justice and righteousness for all his people. 
1CH.18.15	Joab the son of Zeruiah 
1CH.18.16	and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar 
1CH.18.17	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada 
1CH.19.1	Now it came about after this, that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon died, and his son became king in his place. 
1CH.19.2	Then David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the sons of Ammon to Hanun to console him. 
1CH.19.3	But the princes of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David is honoring your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?” 
1CH.19.4	So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle as far as their hips, and sent them away. 
1CH.19.5	Then 
1CH.19.6	When the sons of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah and from Zobah. 
1CH.19.7	So they hired for themselves 32,000 chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and camped before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered together from their cities and came to battle. 
1CH.19.8	When David heard 
1CH.19.9	The sons of Ammon came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.
1CH.19.10	Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and in the rear, he selected from all the choice men of Israel and they arrayed themselves against the Arameans. 
1CH.19.11	But the remainder of the people he placed in the hand of Abshai his brother; and they arrayed themselves against the sons of Ammon. 
1CH.19.12	He said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you. 
1CH.19.13	Be strong, and let us show ourselves courageous for the sake of our people and for the cities of our God; and may the L
1CH.19.14	So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Arameans, and they fled before him. 
1CH.19.15	When the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans fled, they also fled before Abshai his brother and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the 
1CH.19.17	When it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan, and came upon them and drew up in formation against them. And when David drew up in battle array against the Arameans, they fought against him. 
1CH.19.18	The Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed of the Arameans 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put to death Shophach the commander of the army. 
1CH.19.19	So when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and served him. Thus the Arameans were not willing to help the sons of Ammon anymore.
1CH.20.1	Then it happened in the spring, at the time when kings go out 
1CH.20.2	David took the crown of their king from his head, and he found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there was a precious stone in it; and it was placed on David’s head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount. 
1CH.20.3	He brought out the people who 
1CH.20.4	Now it came about after this, that war broke out at Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the giants, and they were subdued. 
1CH.20.5	And there was war with the Philistines again, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear 
1CH.20.6	Again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of 
1CH.20.7	When he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him. 
1CH.20.8	These were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
1CH.21.1	Then Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel. 
1CH.21.2	So David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, “Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan, and bring me 
1CH.21.3	Joab said, “May the L
1CH.21.4	Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore, Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	Joab gave the number of the census of 
1CH.21.6	But he did not number Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s command was abhorrent to Joab.
1CH.21.7	God was displeased with this thing, so He struck Israel. 
1CH.21.8	David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now, please take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.”
1CH.21.9	The L
1CH.21.10	“Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Thus says the L
1CH.21.11	So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the L
1CH.21.12	either three years of famine, or three months to be swept away before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes 
1CH.21.13	David said to Gad, “I am in great distress; please let me fall into the hand of the L
1CH.21.14	So the L
1CH.21.15	And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but as he was about to destroy 
1CH.21.16	Then David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the L
1CH.21.17	David said to God, “Is it not I who commanded to count the people? Indeed, I am the one who has sinned and done very wickedly, but these sheep, what have they done? O L
1CH.21.18	Then the angel of the L
1CH.21.19	So David went up at the word of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the L
1CH.21.20	Now Ornan turned back and saw the angel, and his four sons 
1CH.21.21	As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out from the threshing floor and prostrated himself before David with his face to the ground. 
1CH.21.22	Then David said to Ornan, “Give me the site of 
1CH.21.23	Ornan said to David, “Take 
1CH.21.24	But King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will surely buy 
1CH.21.25	So David gave Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the site. 
1CH.21.26	Then David built an altar to the L
1CH.21.27	The L
1CH.21.28	At that time, when David saw that the L
1CH.21.29	For the tabernacle of the L
1CH.21.30	But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was terrified by the sword of the angel of the L
1CH.22.1	Then David said, “This is the house of the L
1CH.22.2	So David gave orders to gather the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, and he set stonecutters to hew out stones to build the house of God. 
1CH.22.3	David prepared large quantities of iron to make the nails for the doors of the gates and for the clamps, and more bronze than could be weighed; 
1CH.22.4	and timbers of cedar logs beyond number, for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought large quantities of cedar timber to David. 
1CH.22.5	David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the L
1CH.22.6	Then he called for his son Solomon, and charged him to build a house for the L
1CH.22.7	David said to Solomon, “My son, I had intended to build a house to the name of the L
1CH.22.8	But the word of the L
1CH.22.9	Behold, a son will be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side; for his name shall be 
1CH.22.10	He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’ 
1CH.22.11	Now, my son, the L

1CH.22.15	Moreover, there are many workmen with you, stonecutters and masons of stone and carpenters, and all men who are skillful in every kind of work. 
1CH.22.16	Of the gold, the silver and the bronze and the iron there is no limit. Arise and work, and may the L
1CH.22.17	David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon, 
1CH.22.18	“Is not the L
1CH.22.19	Now set your heart and your soul to seek the L
1CH.23.1	Now when David reached old age, he made his son Solomon king over Israel. 
1CH.23.2	And he gathered together all the leaders of Israel with the priests and the Levites.
1CH.23.3	The Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward, and their number by census of men was 38,000. 
1CH.23.4	Of these, 24,000 were to oversee the work of the house of the L
1CH.23.5	and 4,000 
1CH.23.6	David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1CH.23.7	Of the Gershonites 
1CH.23.8	The sons of Ladan 
1CH.23.9	The sons of Shimei 
1CH.23.10	The sons of Shimei 
1CH.23.11	Jahath was the first and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they became a father’s household, one class.
1CH.23.12	The sons of Kohath were four: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. 
1CH.23.13	The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was set apart to sanctify him as most holy, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the L
1CH.23.14	But 
1CH.23.15	The sons of Moses 
1CH.23.16	The son of Gershom 
1CH.23.17	The son of Eliezer was Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. 
1CH.23.18	The son of Izhar was Shelomith the chief. 
1CH.23.19	The sons of Hebron 
1CH.23.20	The sons of Uzziel 
1CH.23.21	The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli 
1CH.23.22	Eleazar died and had no sons, but daughters only, so their brothers, the sons of Kish, took them 
1CH.23.23	The sons of Mushi 
1CH.23.24	These were the sons of Levi according to their fathers’ households, 
1CH.23.25	For David said, “The L
1CH.23.26	Also, the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its utensils for its service.” 
1CH.23.27	For by the last words of David the sons of Levi 
1CH.23.28	For their office is to assist the sons of Aaron with the service of the house of the L
1CH.23.29	and with the showbread, and the fine flour for a grain offering, and unleavened wafers, or 
1CH.23.30	They are to stand every morning to thank and to praise the L
1CH.23.31	and to offer all burnt offerings to the L
1CH.23.32	Thus they are to keep charge of the tent of meeting, and charge of the holy place, and charge of the sons of Aaron their relatives, for the service of the house of the L
1CH.24.1	Now the divisions of the descendants of Aaron 
1CH.24.2	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no sons. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests. 
1CH.24.3	David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their offices for their ministry. 
1CH.24.4	Since more chief men were found from the descendants of Eleazar than the descendants of Ithamar, they divided them thus: 
1CH.24.5	Thus they were divided by lot, the one as the other; for they were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God, both from the descendants of Eleazar and the descendants of Ithamar. 
1CH.24.6	Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel the scribe, from the Levites, recorded them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ 
1CH.24.7	Now the first lot came out for Jehoiarib, the second for Jedaiah, 
1CH.24.8	the third for Harim, the fourth for Seorim, 
1CH.24.9	the fifth for Malchijah, the sixth for Mijamin,

1CH.24.17	the twenty-first for Jachin, the twenty-second for Gamul, 
1CH.24.18	the twenty-third for Delaiah, the twenty-fourth for Maaziah. 
1CH.24.19	These were their offices for their ministry when

1CH.24.21	Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the first.

1CH.24.29	By Kish: the sons of Kish, Jerahmeel. 
1CH.24.30	The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth. These 
1CH.24.31	These also cast lots just as their relatives the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’

1CH.27.23	But David did not count those twenty years of age and under, because the L
1CH.27.24	Joab the son of Zeruiah had begun to count 
1CH.27.25	Now Azmaveth the son of Adiel had charge of the king’s storehouses. And Jonathan the son of Uzziah had charge of the storehouses in the country, in the cities, in the villages and in the towers. 
1CH.27.26	Ezri the son of Chelub had charge of the agricultural workers who tilled the soil.

1CH.27.34	Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar succeeded Ahithophel; and Joab was the commander of the king’s army.
1CH.28.1	Now David assembled at Jerusalem all the officials of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the commanders of the divisions that served the king, and the commanders of thousands, and the commanders of hundreds, and the overseers of all the property and livestock belonging to the king and his sons, with the officials and the mighty men, even all the valiant men. 
1CH.28.2	Then King David rose to his feet and said, “Listen to me, my brethren and my people; I 
1CH.28.3	But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for My name because you are a man of war and have shed blood.’ 
1CH.28.4	Yet, the L
1CH.28.5	Of all my sons (for the L
1CH.28.6	He said to me, ‘Your son Solomon is the one who shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him to be a son to Me, and I will be a father to him. 
1CH.28.7	I will establish his kingdom forever if he resolutely performs My commandments and My ordinances, as is done now.’ 
1CH.28.8	So now, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the L
1CH.28.9	“As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a whole heart and a willing mind; for the L
1CH.28.10	Consider now, for the L
1CH.28.11	Then David gave to his son Solomon the plan of the porch 
1CH.28.12	and the plan of all that he had in mind, for the courts of the house of the L
1CH.28.13	also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites and for all the work of the service of the house of the L
1CH.28.14	for the golden 
1CH.28.15	and the weight 
1CH.28.16	and the gold by weight for the tables of showbread, for each table; and silver for the silver tables; 
1CH.28.17	and the forks, the basins, and the pitchers of pure gold; and for the golden bowls with the weight for each bowl; and for the silver bowls with the weight for each bowl; 
1CH.28.18	and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the model of the chariot, 
1CH.28.19	“All 
1CH.28.20	Then David said to his son Solomon, “Be strong and courageous, and act; do not fear nor be dismayed, for the L
1CH.28.21	Now behold, 
1CH.29.1	Then King David said to the entire assembly, “My son Solomon, whom alone God has chosen, is still young and inexperienced and the work is great; for the temple is not for man, but for the L
1CH.29.2	Now with all my ability I have provided for the house of my God the gold for the 
1CH.29.3	Moreover, in my delight in the house of my God, the treasure I have of gold and silver, I give to the house of my God, over and above all that I have already provided for the holy 
1CH.29.4	 3,000 talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the buildings; 
1CH.29.5	of gold for the 
1CH.29.6	Then the rulers of the fathers’ 
1CH.29.7	and for the service for the house of God they gave 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, and 10,000 talents of silver, and 18,000 talents of brass, and 100,000 talents of iron. 
1CH.29.8	Whoever possessed 
1CH.29.9	Then the people rejoiced because they had offered so willingly, for they made their offering to the L
1CH.29.10	So David blessed the L
1CH.29.11	Yours, O L
1CH.29.12	Both riches and honor 
1CH.29.13	Now therefore, our God, we thank You, and praise Your glorious name.
1CH.29.14	“But who am I and who are my people that we should be able to offer as generously as this? For all things come from You, and from Your hand we have given You. 
1CH.29.15	For we are sojourners before You, and tenants, as all our fathers were; our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope. 
1CH.29.16	O L
1CH.29.17	Since I know, O my God, that You try the heart and delight in uprightness, I, in the integrity of my heart, have willingly offered all these 
1CH.29.18	O L
1CH.29.19	and give to my son Solomon a perfect heart to keep Your commandments, Your testimonies and Your statutes, and to do 
1CH.29.20	Then David said to all the assembly, “Now bless the L
1CH.29.21	On the next day they made sacrifices to the L
1CH.29.22	So they ate and drank that day before the L
1CH.29.23	Then Solomon sat on the throne of the L
1CH.29.24	All the officials, the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David pledged allegiance to King Solomon. 
1CH.29.25	The L
1CH.29.26	Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
1CH.29.27	The period which he reigned over Israel 
1CH.29.28	Then he died in a ripe old age, full of days, riches and honor; and his son Solomon reigned in his place. 
1CH.29.29	Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the chronicles of Samuel the seer, in the chronicles of Nathan the prophet and in the chronicles of Gad the seer, 
1CH.29.30	with all his reign, his power, and the circumstances which came on him, on Israel, and on all the kingdoms of the lands.
2CH.1.1	Now Solomon the son of David established himself securely over his kingdom, and the L
2CH.1.2	Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ 
2CH.1.3	Then Solomon and all the assembly with him went to the high place which was at Gibeon, for God’s tent of meeting was there, which Moses the servant of the L
2CH.1.4	However, David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. 
2CH.1.5	Now the bronze altar, which Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the L
2CH.1.6	Solomon went up there before the L
2CH.1.7	In that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask what I shall give you.”
2CH.1.8	Solomon said to God, “You have dealt with my father David with great lovingkindness, and have made me king in his place. 
2CH.1.9	Now, O L
2CH.1.10	Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can rule this great people of Yours?” 
2CH.1.11	God said to Solomon, “Because you had this in mind, and did not ask for riches, wealth or honor, or the life of those who hate you, nor have you even asked for long life, but you have asked for yourself wisdom and knowledge that you may rule My people over whom I have made you king, 
2CH.1.12	wisdom and knowledge have been granted to you. And I will give you riches and wealth and honor, such as none of the kings who were before you has possessed nor those who will come after you.” 
2CH.1.13	So Solomon went from the high place which was at Gibeon, from the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem, and he reigned over Israel.
2CH.1.14	Solomon amassed chariots and horsemen. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem. 
2CH.1.15	The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the lowland. 
2CH.1.16	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue; the king’s traders procured them from Kue for a price. 
2CH.1.17	They imported chariots from Egypt for 600 
2CH.2.1	Now Solomon decided to build a house for the name of the L
2CH.2.2	So Solomon assigned 70,000 men to carry loads and 80,000 men to quarry 
2CH.2.3	Then Solomon sent 
2CH.2.4	Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the L
2CH.2.5	The house which I am about to build 
2CH.2.6	But who is able to build a house for Him, for the heavens and the highest heavens cannot contain Him? So who am I, that I should build a house for Him, except to 
2CH.2.7	Now send me a skilled man to work in gold, silver, brass and iron, and in purple, crimson and violet 
2CH.2.8	Send me also cedar, cypress and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber of Lebanon; and indeed my servants 
2CH.2.9	to prepare timber in abundance for me, for the house which I am about to build 
2CH.2.10	Now behold, I will give to your servants, the woodsmen who cut the timber, 20,000 
2CH.2.11	Then Huram, king of Tyre, answered in a letter sent to Solomon: “Because the L
2CH.2.12	Then Huram continued, “Blessed be the L
2CH.2.13	“Now I am sending Huram-abi, a skilled man, endowed with understanding, 
2CH.2.14	the son of a Danite woman and a Tyrian father, who knows how to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone and wood, 
2CH.2.15	Now then, let my lord send to his servants wheat and barley, oil and wine, of which he has spoken. 
2CH.2.16	We will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you on rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may carry it up to Jerusalem.”
2CH.2.17	Solomon numbered all the aliens who 
2CH.2.18	He appointed 70,000 of them to carry loads and 80,000 to quarry 
2CH.3.1	Then Solomon began to build the house of the L
2CH.3.2	He began to build on the second 
2CH.3.3	Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for building the house of God. The length in 
2CH.3.4	The porch which was in front of the house was as long as the width of the house, twenty cubits, and the height 120; and inside he overlaid it with pure gold. 
2CH.3.5	He overlaid the main room with cypress wood and overlaid it with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains. 
2CH.3.6	Further, he adorned the house with precious stones; and the gold was gold from Parvaim. 
2CH.3.7	He also overlaid the house with gold—the beams, the thresholds and its walls and its doors; and he carved cherubim on the walls.
2CH.3.8	Now he made the room of the holy of holies: its length across the width of the house 
2CH.3.9	The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold.
2CH.3.10	Then he made two sculptured cherubim in the room of the holy of holies and overlaid them with gold. 
2CH.3.11	The wingspan of the cherubim 
2CH.3.12	The wing of the other cherub, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house; and 
2CH.3.13	The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits, and they stood on their feet facing the 
2CH.3.14	He made the veil of violet, purple, crimson and fine linen, and he worked cherubim on it.
2CH.3.15	He also made two pillars for the front of the house, thirty-five cubits high, and the capital on the top of each 
2CH.3.16	He made chains in the inner sanctuary and placed 
2CH.3.17	He erected the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right and the other on the left, and named the one on the right Jachin and the one on the left Boaz.
2CH.4.1	Then he made a bronze altar, twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in width and ten cubits in height. 
2CH.4.2	Also he made the cast 
2CH.4.3	Now figures like oxen 
2CH.4.4	It stood on twelve oxen, three facing the north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east; and the sea 
2CH.4.5	It was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, 
2CH.4.6	He also made ten basins in which to wash, and he set five on the right side and five on the left to rinse things for the burnt offering; but the sea 
2CH.4.7	Then he made the ten golden lampstands in the way prescribed for them and he set them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. 
2CH.4.8	He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred golden bowls. 
2CH.4.9	Then he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with bronze. 
2CH.4.10	He set the sea on the right side 
2CH.4.11	Huram also made the pails, the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished doing the work which he performed for King Solomon in the house of God: 
2CH.4.12	the two pillars, the bowls and the two capitals on top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on top of the pillars, 
2CH.4.13	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the pillars. 
2CH.4.14	He also made the stands and he made the basins on the stands, 
2CH.4.15	 the one sea with the twelve oxen under it. 
2CH.4.16	The pails, the shovels, the forks and all its utensils, Huram-abi made of polished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the L
2CH.4.17	On the plain of the Jordan the king cast them in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. 
2CH.4.18	Thus Solomon made all these utensils in great quantities, for the weight of the bronze could not be found out.
2CH.4.19	Solomon also made all the things that 
2CH.4.20	the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary in the way prescribed; 
2CH.4.21	the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold, of purest gold; 
2CH.4.22	and the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons and the firepans of pure gold; and the entrance of the house, its inner doors for the holy of holies and the doors of the house, 
2CH.5.1	Thus all the work that Solomon performed for the house of the L
2CH.5.2	Then Solomon assembled to Jerusalem the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers’ 
2CH.5.3	All the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, that is 
2CH.5.4	Then all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark. 
2CH.5.5	They brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the holy utensils which 
2CH.5.6	And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him before the ark, were sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered. 
2CH.5.7	Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the L
2CH.5.8	For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering over the ark and its poles. 
2CH.5.9	The poles were so long that the ends of the poles of the ark could be seen in front of the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen outside; and they are there to this day. 
2CH.5.10	There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put 
2CH.5.11	When the priests came forth from the holy place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, without regard to divisions), 
2CH.5.12	and all the Levitical singers, Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and kinsmen, clothed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps and lyres, standing east of the altar, and with them one hundred and twenty priests blowing trumpets 
2CH.5.13	in unison when the trumpeters and the singers were to make themselves heard with one voice to praise and to glorify the L
2CH.5.14	so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the L
2CH.6.1	Then Solomon said,
2CH.6.1	“The L
2CH.6.2	I have built You a lofty house,
2CH.6.2	And a place for Your dwelling forever.”
2CH.6.3	Then the king faced about and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing. 
2CH.6.4	He said, “Blessed be the L
2CH.6.5	‘Since the day that I brought My people from the land of Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel 
2CH.6.6	but I have chosen Jerusalem that My name might be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.’ 
2CH.6.7	Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of the L
2CH.6.8	But the L
2CH.6.9	Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who will be born to you, he shall build the house for My name.’ 
2CH.6.10	Now the L
2CH.6.11	There I have set the ark in which is the covenant of the L
2CH.6.12	Then he stood before the altar of the L
2CH.6.13	Now Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and he stood on it, knelt on his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven. 
2CH.6.14	He said, “O L
2CH.6.15	who has kept with Your servant David, my father, that which You have promised him; indeed You have spoken with Your mouth and have fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day. 
2CH.6.16	Now therefore, O L
2CH.6.17	Now therefore, O L
2CH.6.18	“But will God indeed dwell with mankind on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You; how much less this house which I have built. 
2CH.6.19	Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication, O L
2CH.6.20	that Your eye may be open toward this house day and night, toward the place of which You have said that 
2CH.6.21	Listen to the supplications of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place; hear from Your dwelling place, from heaven; hear and forgive.
2CH.6.22	“If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath, and he comes 
2CH.6.23	then hear from heaven and act and judge Your servants, punishing the wicked by bringing his way on his own head and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness.
2CH.6.24	“If Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and they return 
2CH.6.25	then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You have given to them and to their fathers.
2CH.6.26	“When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and turn from their sin when You afflict them; 
2CH.6.27	then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants and Your people Israel, indeed, teach them the good way in which they should walk. And send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people for an inheritance.
2CH.6.28	“If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, if there is locust or grasshopper, if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities, whatever plague or whatever sickness 
2CH.6.29	whatever prayer or supplication is made by any man or by all Your people Israel, each knowing his own affliction and his own pain, and spreading his hands toward this house, 
2CH.6.30	then hear from heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive, and render to each according to all his ways, whose heart You know for You alone know the hearts of the sons of men, 
2CH.6.31	that they may

2CH.6.34	“When Your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way You shall send them, and they pray to You toward this city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name, 
2CH.6.35	then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
2CH.6.36	“When they sin against You (for there is no man who does not sin) and You are angry with them and deliver them to an enemy, so that they take them away captive to a land far off or near, 
2CH.6.37	if they take thought in the land where they are taken captive, and repent and make supplication to You in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned, we have committed iniquity and have acted wickedly’; 
2CH.6.38	if they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have been taken captive, and pray toward their land which You have given to their fathers and the city which You have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Your name, 
2CH.6.39	then hear from heaven, from Your dwelling place, their prayer and supplications, and maintain their cause and forgive Your people who have sinned against You.
2CH.6.40	“Now, O my God, I pray, let Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer 
2CH.6.41	“Now therefore arise, O L

2CH.7.1	Now when Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the L
2CH.7.2	The priests could not enter into the house of the L
2CH.7.3	All the sons of Israel, seeing the fire come down and the glory of the L
2CH.7.4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the L
2CH.7.5	King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. Thus the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. 
2CH.7.6	The priests stood at their posts, and the Levites also, with the instruments of music to the L
2CH.7.7	Then Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that 
2CH.7.8	So Solomon observed the feast at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly 
2CH.7.9	On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for the dedication of the altar they observed seven days and the feast seven days. 
2CH.7.10	Then on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their tents, rejoicing and happy of heart because of the goodness that the L
2CH.7.11	Thus Solomon finished the house of the L
2CH.7.12	Then the L
2CH.7.13	If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among My people, 
2CH.7.14	and My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin and will heal their land. 
2CH.7.15	Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to the prayer 
2CH.7.16	For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that My name may be there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually. 
2CH.7.17	As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, even to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep My statutes and My ordinances, 
2CH.7.18	then I will establish your royal throne as I covenanted with your father David, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man 
2CH.7.19	“But if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, 
2CH.7.20	then I will uproot you from My land which I have given you, and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out of My sight and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. 
2CH.7.21	As for this house, which was exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and say, ‘Why has the L
2CH.7.22	And they will say, ‘Because they forsook the L
2CH.8.1	Now it came about at the end of the twenty years in which Solomon had built the house of the L
2CH.8.2	that he built the cities which Huram had given to him, and settled the sons of Israel there.
2CH.8.3	Then Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and captured it. 
2CH.8.4	He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the storage cities which he had built in Hamath. 
2CH.8.5	He also built upper Beth-horon and lower Beth-horon, fortified cities 
2CH.8.6	and Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen, and all that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land under his rule.
2CH.8.7	All of the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel, 
2CH.8.8	 from their descendants who were left after them in the land whom the sons of Israel had not destroyed, them Solomon raised as forced laborers to this day. 
2CH.8.9	But Solomon did not make slaves for his work from the sons of Israel; they were men of war, his chief captains and commanders of his chariots and his horsemen. 
2CH.8.10	These were the chief officers of King Solomon, two hundred and fifty who ruled over the people.
2CH.8.11	Then Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter up from the city of David to the house which he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy where the ark of the L
2CH.8.12	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the L
2CH.8.13	and 
2CH.8.14	Now according to the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their duties of praise and ministering before the priests according to the daily rule, and the gatekeepers by their divisions at every gate; for David the man of God had so commanded. 
2CH.8.15	And they did not depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites in any manner or concerning the storehouses.
2CH.8.16	Thus all the work of Solomon was carried out from the day of the foundation of the house of the L
2CH.8.17	Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the seashore in the land of Edom. 
2CH.8.18	And Huram by his servants sent him ships and servants who knew the sea; and they went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir, and took from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to King Solomon.
2CH.9.1	Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with difficult questions. She had a very large retinue, with camels carrying spices and a large amount of gold and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was on her heart. 
2CH.9.2	Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from Solomon which he did not explain to her. 
2CH.9.3	When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house which he had built, 
2CH.9.4	the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his ministers and their attire, his cupbearers and their attire, and his stairway by which he went up to the house of the L
2CH.9.5	Then she said to the king, “It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom. 
2CH.9.6	Nevertheless I did not believe their reports until I came and my eyes had seen it. And behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me. You surpass the report that I heard. 
2CH.9.7	How blessed are your men, how blessed are these your servants who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom. 
2CH.9.8	Blessed be the L
2CH.9.9	Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold and a very great 
2CH.9.10	The servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum trees and precious stones. 
2CH.9.11	From the algum trees the king made steps for the house of the L
2CH.9.12	King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire which she requested besides 
2CH.9.13	Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold, 
2CH.9.14	besides that which the traders and merchants brought; and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. 
2CH.9.15	King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold, using 600 
2CH.9.16	 300 shields of beaten gold, using three hundred shekels of gold on each shield, and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
2CH.9.17	Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	 six steps to the throne and a footstool in gold attached to the throne, and arms on each side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms. 
2CH.9.19	Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on the one side and on the other; nothing like 
2CH.9.20	All King Solomon’s drinking vessels 
2CH.9.21	For the king had ships which went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold and silver, ivory and apes and peacocks.
2CH.9.22	So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
2CH.9.23	And all the kings of the earth were seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart. 
2CH.9.24	They brought every man his gift, articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses and mules, so much year by year.
2CH.9.25	Now Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots and 12,000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 
2CH.9.26	He was the ruler over all the kings from the Euphrates River even to the land of the Philistines, and as far as the border of Egypt. 
2CH.9.27	The king made silver 
2CH.9.28	And they were bringing horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all countries.
2CH.9.29	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from first to last, are they not written in the records of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 
2CH.9.30	Solomon reigned forty years in Jerusalem over all Israel.
2CH.9.31	And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David; and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place.
2CH.10.1	Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 
2CH.10.2	When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard 
2CH.10.3	So they sent and summoned him. When Jeroboam and all Israel came, they spoke to Rehoboam, saying, 
2CH.10.4	“Your father made our yoke hard; now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you.” 
2CH.10.5	He said to them, “Return to me again in three days.” So the people departed.
2CH.10.6	Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, “How do you counsel 
2CH.10.7	They spoke to him, saying, “If you will be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.” 
2CH.10.8	But he forsook the counsel of the elders which they had given him, and consulted with the young men who grew up with him and served him. 
2CH.10.9	So he said to them, “What counsel do you give that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke which your father put on us’?” 
2CH.10.10	The young men who grew up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall say to the people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter for us.’ Thus you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins! 
2CH.10.11	Whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I 
2CH.10.12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had directed, saying, “Return to me on the third day.” 
2CH.10.13	The king answered them harshly, and King Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the elders. 
2CH.10.14	He spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I 
2CH.10.15	So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn 
2CH.10.16	When all Israel 
2CH.10.16	“What portion do we have in David?
2CH.10.16	Every man to your tents, O Israel;
2CH.10.16	Now look after your own house, David.”
2CH.10.16	So all Israel departed to their tents. 
2CH.10.17	But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
2CH.10.18	Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the forced labor, and the sons of Israel stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. 
2CH.10.19	So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
2CH.11.1	Now when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam. 
2CH.11.2	But the word of the L
2CH.11.3	“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, 
2CH.11.4	‘Thus says the L
2CH.11.5	Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built cities for defense in Judah. 
2CH.11.6	Thus he built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin. 
2CH.11.11	He also strengthened the fortresses and put officers in them and stores of food, oil and wine. 
2CH.11.12	 shields and spears in every city and strengthened them greatly. So he held Judah and Benjamin.
2CH.11.13	Moreover, the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel stood with him from all their districts.
2CH.11.14	For the Levites left their pasture lands and their property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had excluded them from serving as priests to the L
2CH.11.15	He set up priests of his own for the high places, for the satyrs and for the calves which he had made. 
2CH.11.16	Those from all the tribes of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the L
2CH.11.17	They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam the son of Solomon for three years, for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years.
2CH.11.18	Then Rehoboam took as a wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David 
2CH.11.19	and she bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom, and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza and Shelomith. 
2CH.11.21	Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom more than all his 
2CH.11.22	Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as head and leader among his brothers, for he 
2CH.11.23	He acted wisely and distributed some of his sons through all the territories of Judah and Benjamin to all the fortified cities, and he gave them food in abundance. And he sought many wives 
2CH.12.1	When the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and strong, he and all Israel with him forsook the law of the L
2CH.12.2	And it came about in King Rehoboam’s fifth year, because they had been unfaithful to the L
2CH.12.3	with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen. And the people who came with him from Egypt were without number: the Lubim, the Sukkiim and the Ethiopians. 
2CH.12.4	He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem. 
2CH.12.5	Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and he said to them, “Thus says the L
2CH.12.6	So the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The L
2CH.12.7	When the L
2CH.12.8	But they will become his slaves so that they may learn 
2CH.12.9	So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took the treasures of the house of the L
2CH.12.10	Then King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place and committed them to the care of the commanders of the guard who guarded the door of the king’s house. 
2CH.12.11	As often as the king entered the house of the L
2CH.12.12	And when he humbled himself, the anger of the L
2CH.12.13	So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the L
2CH.12.14	He did evil because he did not set his heart to seek the L
2CH.12.15	Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, according to genealogical enrollment? And 
2CH.12.16	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David; and his son Abijah became king in his place.
2CH.13.1	In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah. 
2CH.13.2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.
2CH.13.3	Abijah began the battle with an army of valiant warriors, 400,000 chosen men, while Jeroboam drew up in battle formation against him with 800,000 chosen men 
2CH.13.4	Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Listen to me, Jeroboam and all Israel: 
2CH.13.5	Do you not know that the L
2CH.13.6	Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master, 
2CH.13.7	and worthless men gathered about him, scoundrels, who proved too strong for Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, when he was young and timid and could not hold his own against them.
2CH.13.8	“So now you intend to resist the kingdom of the L

2CH.13.15	Then the men of Judah raised a war cry, and when the men of Judah raised the war cry, then it was that God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
2CH.13.16	When the sons of Israel fled before Judah, God gave them into their hand. 
2CH.13.17	Abijah and his people defeated them with a great slaughter, so that 500,000 chosen men of Israel fell slain. 
2CH.13.18	Thus the sons of Israel were subdued at that time, and the sons of Judah conquered because they trusted in the L
2CH.13.19	Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured from him 
2CH.13.20	Jeroboam did not again recover strength in the days of Abijah; and the L
2CH.13.21	But Abijah became powerful; and took fourteen wives to himself, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. 
2CH.13.22	Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways and his words are written in the treatise of the prophet Iddo.
2CH.14.1	So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and his son Asa became king in his place. The land was undisturbed for ten years during his days.
2CH.14.2	Asa did good and right in the sight of the L
2CH.14.3	for he removed the foreign altars and high places, tore down the 
2CH.14.4	and commanded Judah to seek the L
2CH.14.5	He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah. And the kingdom was undisturbed under him. 
2CH.14.6	He built fortified cities in Judah, since the land was undisturbed, and there was no one at war with him during those years, because the L
2CH.14.7	For he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and surround 
2CH.14.8	Now Asa had an army of 300,000 from Judah, bearing large shields and spears, and 280,000 from Benjamin, bearing shields and wielding bows; all of them were valiant warriors.
2CH.14.9	Now Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots, and he came to Mareshah. 
2CH.14.10	So Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up in battle formation in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 
2CH.14.11	Then Asa called to the L
2CH.14.12	So the L
2CH.14.13	Asa and the people who 
2CH.14.14	They destroyed all the cities around Gerar, for the dread of the L
2CH.14.15	They also struck down those who owned livestock, and they carried away large numbers of sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	Now the Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded, 
2CH.15.2	and he went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Listen to me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: the L
2CH.15.3	For many days Israel was without the true God and without a teaching priest and without law. 
2CH.15.4	But in their distress they turned to the L
2CH.15.5	In those times there was no peace to him who went out or to him who came in, for many disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands. 
2CH.15.6	Nation was crushed by nation, and city by city, for God troubled them with every kind of distress. 
2CH.15.7	But you, be strong and do not lose courage, for there is reward for your work.”
2CH.15.8	Now when Asa heard these words and the prophecy which Azariah the son of Oded the prophet spoke, he took courage and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities which he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He then restored the altar of the L
2CH.15.9	He gathered all Judah and Benjamin and those from Ephraim, Manasseh and Simeon who resided with them, for many defected to him from Israel when they saw that the L
2CH.15.10	So they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign. 
2CH.15.11	They sacrificed to the L
2CH.15.12	They entered into the covenant to seek the L
2CH.15.13	and whoever would not seek the L
2CH.15.14	Moreover, they made an oath to the L
2CH.15.15	All Judah rejoiced concerning the oath, for they had sworn with their whole heart and had sought Him earnestly, and He let them find Him. So the L
2CH.15.16	He also removed Maacah, the mother of King Asa, from the 
2CH.15.17	But the high places were not removed from Israel; nevertheless Asa’s heart was blameless all his days. 
2CH.15.18	He brought into the house of God the dedicated things of his father and his own dedicated things: silver and gold and utensils. 
2CH.15.19	And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
2CH.16.1	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent 
2CH.16.2	Then Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the L
2CH.16.3	“
2CH.16.4	So Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim and all the store cities of Naphtali. 
2CH.16.5	When Baasha heard 
2CH.16.6	Then King Asa brought all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had been building, and with them he fortified Geba and Mizpah.
2CH.16.7	At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, “Because you have relied on the king of Aram and have not relied on the L
2CH.16.8	Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim an immense army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the L
2CH.16.9	For the eyes of the L
2CH.16.10	Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in prison, for he was enraged at him for this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.
2CH.16.11	Now, the acts of Asa from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.16.12	In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa became diseased in his feet. His disease was severe, yet even in his disease he did not seek the L
2CH.16.13	So Asa slept with his fathers, having died in the forty-first year of his reign. 
2CH.16.14	They buried him in his own tomb which he had cut out for himself in the city of David, and they laid him in the resting place which he had filled with spices of various kinds blended by the perfumers’ art; and they made a very great fire for him.
2CH.17.1	Jehoshaphat his son then became king in his place, and made his position over Israel firm. 
2CH.17.2	He placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had captured.
2CH.17.3	The L
2CH.17.4	but sought the God of his father, followed His commandments, and did not act as Israel did. 
2CH.17.5	So the L
2CH.17.6	He took great pride in the ways of the L
2CH.17.7	Then in the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; 
2CH.17.8	and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. 
2CH.17.9	They taught in Judah, 
2CH.17.10	Now the dread of the L
2CH.17.11	Some of the Philistines brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat; the Arabians also brought him flocks, 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats. 
2CH.17.12	So Jehoshaphat grew greater and greater, and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah. 
2CH.17.13	He had large supplies in the cities of Judah, and warriors, valiant men, in Jerusalem. 
2CH.17.14	This was their muster according to their fathers’ households: of Judah, commanders of thousands, Adnah 
2CH.17.15	and next to him 
2CH.17.16	and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who volunteered for the L
2CH.17.17	and of Benjamin, Eliada a valiant warrior, and with him 200,000 armed with bow and shield; 
2CH.17.18	and next to him Jehozabad, and with him 180,000 equipped for war. 
2CH.17.19	These are they who served the king, apart from those whom the king put in the fortified cities through all Judah.
2CH.18.1	Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor; and he allied himself by marriage with Ahab. 
2CH.18.2	Some years later he went down to 
2CH.18.3	Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me 
2CH.18.4	Moreover, Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the L
2CH.18.5	Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?” And they said, “Go up, for God will give 
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not yet a prophet of the L
2CH.18.7	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the L
2CH.18.8	Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah, Imla’s son.” 
2CH.18.9	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in 
2CH.18.10	Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron for himself and said, “Thus says the L
2CH.18.11	All the prophets were prophesying thus, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and succeed, for the L
2CH.18.12	Then the messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him saying, “Behold, the words of the prophets are uniformly favorable to the king. So please let your word be like one of them and speak favorably.” 
2CH.18.13	But Micaiah said, “As the L
2CH.18.14	When he came to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?” He said, “Go up and succeed, for they will be given into your hand.” 
2CH.18.15	Then the king said to him, “How many times must I adjure you to speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the L
2CH.18.16	So he said,
2CH.18.16	“I saw all Israel
2CH.18.16	Scattered on the mountains,
2CH.18.16	Like sheep which have no shepherd;
2CH.18.16	And the L
2CH.18.16	‘These have no master.
2CH.18.16	Let each of them return to his house in peace.’ ”
2CH.18.17	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”
2CH.18.18	Micaiah said, “Therefore, hear the word of the L
2CH.18.19	The L
2CH.18.20	Then a spirit came forward and stood before the L
2CH.18.21	He said, ‘I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ Then He said, ‘You are to entice 
2CH.18.22	Now therefore, behold, the L
2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, “How did the Spirit of the L
2CH.18.24	Micaiah said, “Behold, you will see on that day when you enter an inner room to hide yourself.” 
2CH.18.25	Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son; 
2CH.18.26	and say, ‘Thus says the king, “Put this 
2CH.18.27	Micaiah said, “If you indeed return safely, the L
2CH.18.28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up against Ramoth-gilead. 
2CH.18.29	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle. 
2CH.18.30	Now the king of Aram had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, “Do not fight with small or great, but with the king of Israel alone.” 
2CH.18.31	So when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is the king of Israel,” and they turned aside to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and the L
2CH.18.32	When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. 
2CH.18.33	A certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel in a joint of the armor. So he said to the driver of the chariot, “Turn around and take me out of the fight, for I am severely wounded.” 
2CH.18.34	The battle raged that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot in front of the Arameans until the evening; and at sunset he died.
2CH.19.1	Then Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned in safety to his house in Jerusalem. 
2CH.19.2	Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the L
2CH.19.3	But there is 
2CH.19.4	So Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to the L
2CH.19.5	He appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city. 
2CH.19.6	He said to the judges, “Consider what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the L
2CH.19.7	Now then let the fear of the L
2CH.19.8	In Jerusalem also Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and priests, and some of the heads of the fathers’ 
2CH.19.9	Then he charged them saying, “Thus you shall do in the fear of the L
2CH.19.10	Whenever any dispute comes to you from your brethren who live in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, you shall warn them so that they may not be guilty before the L
2CH.19.11	Behold, Amariah the chief priest will be over you in all that pertains to the L
2CH.20.1	Now it came about after this that the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon, together with some of the Meunites, came to make war against Jehoshaphat. 
2CH.20.2	Then some came and reported to Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, out of Aram and behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar (that is Engedi).” 
2CH.20.3	Jehoshaphat was afraid and turned his attention to seek the L
2CH.20.4	So Judah gathered together to seek help from the L
2CH.20.5	Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the L
2CH.20.6	and he said, “O L
2CH.20.7	Did You not, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and give it to the descendants of Abraham Your friend forever? 
2CH.20.8	They have lived in it, and have built You a sanctuary there for Your name, saying, 
2CH.20.9	‘Should evil come upon us, the sword, 
2CH.20.10	Now behold, the sons of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom You did not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt (they turned aside from them and did not destroy them), 
2CH.20.11	see 
2CH.20.12	O our God, will You not judge them? For we are powerless before this great multitude who are coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are on You.”
2CH.20.13	All Judah was standing before the L
2CH.20.14	Then in the midst of the assembly the Spirit of the L
2CH.20.15	and he said, “Listen, all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat: thus says the L
2CH.20.16	Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they will come up by the ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the valley in front of the wilderness of Jeruel. 
2CH.20.17	You 
2CH.20.18	Jehoshaphat bowed his head with 
2CH.20.19	The Levites, from the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of the Korahites, stood up to praise the L
2CH.20.20	They rose early in the morning and went out to the wilderness of Tekoa; and when they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, O Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, put your trust in the L
2CH.20.21	When he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who sang to the L
2CH.20.22	When they began singing and praising, the L
2CH.20.23	For the sons of Ammon and Moab rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir destroying 
2CH.20.24	When Judah came to the lookout of the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude, and behold, they 
2CH.20.25	When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil, they found much among them, 
2CH.20.26	Then on the fourth day they assembled in the valley of Beracah, for there they blessed the L
2CH.20.27	Every man of Judah and Jerusalem returned with Jehoshaphat at their head, returning to Jerusalem with joy, for the L
2CH.20.28	They came to Jerusalem with harps, lyres and trumpets to the house of the L
2CH.20.29	And the dread of God was on all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the L
2CH.20.30	So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God gave him rest on all sides.
2CH.20.31	Now Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He 
2CH.20.32	He walked in the way of his father Asa and did not depart from it, doing right in the sight of the L
2CH.20.33	The high places, however, were not removed; the people had not yet directed their hearts to the God of their fathers.
2CH.20.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first to last, behold, they are written in the annals of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel.
2CH.20.35	After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah allied himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. He acted wickedly in so doing. 
2CH.20.36	So he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion-geber. 
2CH.20.37	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat saying, “Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the L
2CH.21.1	Then Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Jehoram his son became king in his place. 
2CH.21.2	He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael and Shephatiah. All these 
2CH.21.3	Their father gave them many gifts of silver, gold and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn.
2CH.21.4	Now when Jehoram had taken over the kingdom of his father and made himself secure, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and some of the rulers of Israel also. 
2CH.21.5	Jehoram 
2CH.21.6	He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab did (for Ahab’s daughter was his wife), and he did evil in the sight of the L
2CH.21.7	Yet the L
2CH.21.8	In his days Edom revolted 
2CH.21.9	Then Jehoram crossed over with his commanders and all his chariots with him. And he arose by night and struck down the Edomites who were surrounding him and the commanders of the chariots. 
2CH.21.10	So Edom revolted 
2CH.21.11	Moreover, he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot and led Judah astray.
2CH.21.12	Then a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet saying, “Thus says the L
2CH.21.13	but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot as the house of Ahab played the harlot, and you have also killed your brothers, your own family, who were better than you, 
2CH.21.14	behold, the L
2CH.21.15	and you will suffer severe sickness, a disease of your bowels, until your bowels come out because of the sickness, day by day.’ ”
2CH.21.16	Then the L
2CH.21.17	and they came against Judah and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions found in the king’s house together with his sons and his wives, so that no son was left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
2CH.21.18	So after all this the L
2CH.21.19	Now it came about in the course of time, at the end of two years, that his bowels came out because of his sickness and he died in great pain. And his people made no fire for him like the fire for his fathers. 
2CH.21.20	He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years; and he departed with no one’s regret, and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
2CH.22.1	Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, for the band of men who came with the Arabs to the camp had slain all the older 
2CH.22.2	Ahaziah 
2CH.22.3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly. 
2CH.22.4	He did evil in the sight of the L
2CH.22.5	He also walked according to their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to wage war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. But the Arameans wounded Joram. 
2CH.22.6	So he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had inflicted on him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. And Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2CH.22.7	Now the destruction of Ahaziah was from God, in that he went to Joram. For when he came, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the L
2CH.22.8	It came about when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them. 
2CH.22.9	He also sought Ahaziah, and they caught him while he was hiding in Samaria; they brought him to Jehu, put him to death and buried him. For they said, “He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the L
2CH.22.10	Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she rose and destroyed all the royal offspring of the house of Judah. 
2CH.22.11	But Jehoshabeath the king’s daughter took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons who were being put to death, and placed him and his nurse in the bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah so that she would not put him to death. 
2CH.22.12	He was hidden with them in the house of God six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.
2CH.23.1	Now in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took captains of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Johanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, 
2CH.23.2	They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the fathers’ 
2CH.23.3	Then all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And Jehoiada said to them, “Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the L
2CH.23.4	This is the thing which you shall do: one third of you, of the priests and Levites who come in on the sabbath, 
2CH.23.5	and one third 
2CH.23.6	But let no one enter the house of the L
2CH.23.7	The Levites will surround the king, each man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever enters the house, let him be killed. Thus be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.”
2CH.23.8	So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each one of them took his men who were to come in on the sabbath, with those who were to go out on the sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss 
2CH.23.9	Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields which had been King David’s, which were in the house of God. 
2CH.23.10	He stationed all the people, each man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and by the house, around the king. 
2CH.23.11	Then they brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him, and 
2CH.23.12	When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came into the house of the L
2CH.23.13	She looked, and behold, the king was standing by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpeters 
2CH.23.14	Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were appointed over the army and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks; and whoever follows her, put to death with the sword.” For the priest said, “Let her not be put to death in the house of the L
2CH.23.15	So they seized her, and when she arrived at the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king’s house, they put her to death there.
2CH.23.16	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king, that they would be the L
2CH.23.17	And all the people went to the house of Baal and tore it down, and they broke in pieces his altars and his images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. 
2CH.23.18	Moreover, Jehoiada placed the offices of the house of the L
2CH.23.19	He stationed the gatekeepers of the house of the L
2CH.23.20	He took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of the L
2CH.23.21	So all of the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet. For they had put Athaliah to death with the sword.
2CH.24.1	Joash 
2CH.24.2	Joash did what was right in the sight of the L
2CH.24.3	Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he became the father of sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	Now it came about after this that Joash decided to restore the house of the L
2CH.24.5	He gathered the priests and Levites and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah and collect money from all Israel to repair the house of your God annually, and you shall do the matter quickly.” But the Levites did not act quickly. 
2CH.24.6	So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief 
2CH.24.7	For the sons of the wicked Athaliah had broken into the house of God and even used the holy things of the house of the L
2CH.24.8	So the king commanded, and they made a chest and set it outside by the gate of the house of the L
2CH.24.9	They made a proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the L
2CH.24.10	All the officers and all the people rejoiced and brought in their levies and dropped 
2CH.24.11	It came about whenever the chest was brought in to the king’s officer by the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, then the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer would come, empty the chest, take it, and return it to its place. Thus they did daily and collected much money. 
2CH.24.12	The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the L
2CH.24.13	So the workmen labored, and the repair work progressed in their hands, and they restored the house of God according to its specifications and strengthened it. 
2CH.24.14	When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; and it was made into utensils for the house of the L
2CH.24.15	Now when Jehoiada reached a ripe old age he died; he was one hundred and thirty years old at his death. 
2CH.24.16	They buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done well in Israel and to God and His house.
2CH.24.17	But after the death of Jehoiada the officials of Judah came and bowed down to the king, and the king listened to them. 
2CH.24.18	They abandoned the house of the L
2CH.24.19	Yet He sent prophets to them to bring them back to the L
2CH.24.20	Then the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people and said to them, “Thus God has said, ‘Why do you transgress the commandments of the L
2CH.24.21	So they conspired against him and at the command of the king they stoned him to death in the court of the house of the L
2CH.24.22	Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which his father Jehoiada had shown him, but he murdered his son. And as he died he said, “May the L
2CH.24.23	Now it happened at the turn of the year that the army of the Arameans came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, destroyed all the officials of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus. 
2CH.24.24	Indeed the army of the Arameans came with a small number of men; yet the L
2CH.24.25	When they had departed from him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and murdered him on his bed. So he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings. 
2CH.24.26	Now these are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. 
2CH.24.27	As to his sons and the many oracles against him and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the treatise of the Book of the Kings. Then Amaziah his son became king in his place.
2CH.25.1	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 
2CH.25.2	He did right in the sight of the L
2CH.25.3	Now it came about as soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, that he killed his servants who had slain his father the king. 
2CH.25.4	However, he did not put their children to death, but 
2CH.25.5	Moreover, Amaziah assembled Judah and appointed them according to 
2CH.25.6	He hired also 100,000 valiant warriors out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver. 
2CH.25.7	But a man of God came to him saying, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the L
2CH.25.8	But if you do go, do 
2CH.25.9	Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what 
2CH.25.10	Then Amaziah dismissed them, the troops which came to him from Ephraim, to go home; so their anger burned against Judah and they returned home in fierce anger.
2CH.25.11	Now Amaziah strengthened himself and led his people forth, and went to the Valley of Salt and struck down 10,000 of the sons of Seir. 
2CH.25.12	The sons of Judah also captured 10,000 alive and brought them to the top of the cliff and threw them down from the top of the cliff, so that they were all dashed to pieces. 
2CH.25.13	But the troops whom Amaziah sent back from going with him to battle, raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and struck down 3,000 of them and plundered much spoil.
2CH.25.14	Now after Amaziah came from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, set them up as his gods, bowed down before them and burned incense to them. 
2CH.25.15	Then the anger of the L
2CH.25.16	As he was talking with him, the king said to him, “Have we appointed you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be struck down?” Then the prophet stopped and said, “I know that God has planned to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.”
2CH.25.17	Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us face each other.” 
2CH.25.18	Joash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thorn bush which was in Lebanon sent to the cedar which was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ But there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon and trampled the thorn bush. 
2CH.25.19	You said, ‘Behold, you have defeated Edom.’ And your heart has become proud in boasting. Now stay at home; for why should you provoke trouble so that you, even you, would fall and Judah with you?”
2CH.25.20	But Amaziah would not listen, for it was from God, that He might deliver them into the hand 
2CH.25.21	So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh, which belonged to Judah. 
2CH.25.22	Judah was defeated by Israel, and they fled each to his tent. 
2CH.25.23	Then Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, 400 cubits. 
2CH.25.24	 all the gold and silver and all the utensils which were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
2CH.25.25	And Amaziah, the son of Joash king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. 
2CH.25.26	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, behold, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel? 
2CH.25.27	From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the L
2CH.25.28	Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
2CH.26.1	And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who 
2CH.26.2	He built Eloth and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers. 
2CH.26.3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jechiliah of Jerusalem. 
2CH.26.4	He did right in the sight of the L
2CH.26.5	He continued to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding through the vision of God; and as long as he sought the L
2CH.26.6	Now he went out and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in 
2CH.26.7	God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gur-baal, and the Meunites. 
2CH.26.8	The Ammonites also gave tribute to Uzziah, and his fame extended to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong. 
2CH.26.9	Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the corner buttress and fortified them. 
2CH.26.10	He built towers in the wilderness and hewed many cisterns, for he had much livestock, both in the lowland and in the plain. 
2CH.26.11	Moreover, Uzziah had an army ready for battle, which entered combat by divisions according to the number of their muster, prepared by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the official, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king’s officers. 
2CH.26.12	The total number of the heads of the households, of valiant warriors, was 2,600. 
2CH.26.13	Under their direction was an elite army of 307,500, who could wage war with great power, to help the king against the enemy. 
2CH.26.14	Moreover, Uzziah prepared for all the army shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows and sling stones. 
2CH.26.15	In Jerusalem he made engines 
2CH.26.16	But when he became strong, his heart was so proud that he acted corruptly, and he was unfaithful to the L
2CH.26.17	Then Azariah the priest entered after him and with him eighty priests of the L
2CH.26.18	They opposed Uzziah the king and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the L
2CH.26.19	But Uzziah, with a censer in his hand for burning incense, was enraged; and while he was enraged with the priests, the leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in the house of the L
2CH.26.20	Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he 
2CH.26.21	King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death; and he lived in a separate house, being a leper, for he was cut off from the house of the L
2CH.26.22	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first to last, the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, has written. 
2CH.26.23	So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the grave which belonged to the kings, for they said, “He is a leper.” And Jotham his son became king in his place.
2CH.27.1	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. 
2CH.27.2	He did right in the sight of the L
2CH.27.3	He built the upper gate of the house of the L
2CH.27.4	Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and he built fortresses and towers on the wooded 
2CH.27.5	He fought also with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed over them so that the Ammonites gave him during that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand 
2CH.27.6	So Jotham became mighty because he ordered his ways before the L
2CH.27.7	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, even all his wars and his acts, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. 
2CH.27.8	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.27.9	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Ahaz his son became king in his place.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz 
2CH.28.2	But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel; he also made molten images for the Baals. 
2CH.28.3	Moreover, he burned incense in the valley of Ben-hinnom and burned his sons in fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the L
2CH.28.4	He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills and under every green tree.
2CH.28.5	Wherefore, the L
2CH.28.6	For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah 120,000 in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken the L
2CH.28.7	And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s son and Azrikam the ruler of the house and Elkanah the second to the king.
2CH.28.8	The sons of Israel carried away captive of their brethren 200,000 women, sons and daughters; and they took also a great deal of spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. 
2CH.28.9	But a prophet of the L
2CH.28.10	Now you are proposing to subjugate for yourselves the people of Judah and Jerusalem for male and female slaves. Surely, 
2CH.28.11	Now therefore, listen to me and return the captives whom you captured from your brothers, for the burning anger of the L
2CH.28.12	Then some of the heads of the sons of Ephraim—Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai—arose against those who were coming from the battle, 
2CH.28.13	and said to them, “You must not bring the captives in here, for you are proposing 
2CH.28.14	So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the officers and all the assembly. 
2CH.28.15	Then the men who were designated by name arose, took the captives, and they clothed all their naked ones from the spoil; and they gave them clothes and sandals, fed them and gave them drink, anointed them 
2CH.28.16	At that time King Ahaz sent to the 
2CH.28.17	For again the Edomites had come and attacked Judah and carried away captives. 
2CH.28.18	The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the Negev of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, and Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages, and they settled there. 
2CH.28.19	For the L
2CH.28.20	So Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him. 
2CH.28.21	Although Ahaz took a portion out of the house of the L
2CH.28.22	Now in the time of his distress this same King Ahaz became yet more unfaithful to the L
2CH.28.23	For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him, and said, “Because the gods of the kings of Aram helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me.” But they became the downfall of him and all Israel. 
2CH.28.24	Moreover, when Ahaz gathered together the utensils of the house of God, he cut the utensils of the house of God in pieces; and he closed the doors of the house of the L
2CH.28.25	In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked the L
2CH.28.26	Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.28.27	So Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah became king 
2CH.29.2	He did right in the sight of the L
2CH.29.3	In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the L
2CH.29.4	He brought in the priests and the Levites and gathered them into the square on the east.
2CH.29.5	Then he said to them, “Listen to me, O Levites. Consecrate yourselves now, and consecrate the house of the L
2CH.29.6	For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done evil in the sight of the L
2CH.29.7	They have also shut the doors of the porch and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel. 
2CH.29.8	Therefore the wrath of the L
2CH.29.9	For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. 
2CH.29.10	Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the L
2CH.29.11	My sons, do not be negligent now, for the L
2CH.29.12	Then the Levites arose: Mahath, the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, from the sons of the Kohathites; and from the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and from the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah; 
2CH.29.13	and from the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; and from the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; 
2CH.29.14	and from the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and from the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel. 
2CH.29.15	They assembled their brothers, consecrated themselves, and went in to cleanse the house of the L
2CH.29.16	So the priests went in to the inner part of the house of the L
2CH.29.17	Now they began the consecration on the first 
2CH.29.18	Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed the whole house of the L
2CH.29.19	Moreover, all the utensils which King Ahaz had discarded during his reign in his unfaithfulness, we have prepared and consecrated; and behold, they are before the altar of the L
2CH.29.20	Then King Hezekiah arose early and assembled the princes of the city and went up to the house of the L
2CH.29.21	They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. And he ordered the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer 
2CH.29.22	So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They also slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar; they slaughtered the lambs also and sprinkled the blood on the altar. 
2CH.29.23	Then they brought the male goats of the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them. 
2CH.29.24	The priests slaughtered them and purged the altar with their blood to atone for all Israel, for the king ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.
2CH.29.25	He then stationed the Levites in the house of the L
2CH.29.26	The Levites stood with the 
2CH.29.27	Then Hezekiah gave the order to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song to the L
2CH.29.28	While the whole assembly worshiped, the singers also sang and the trumpets sounded; all this 
2CH.29.29	Now at the completion of the burnt offerings, the king and all who were present with him bowed down and worshiped. 
2CH.29.30	Moreover, King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levites to sing praises to the L
2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah said, “Now 
2CH.29.32	The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the L
2CH.29.33	The consecrated things were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep. 
2CH.29.34	But the priests were too few, so that they were unable to skin all the burnt offerings; therefore their brothers the Levites helped them until the work was completed and until the 
2CH.29.35	There 
2CH.29.36	Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over what God had prepared for the people, because the thing came about suddenly.
2CH.30.1	Now Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the L
2CH.30.2	For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month, 
2CH.30.3	since they could not celebrate it at that time, because the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient numbers, nor had the people been gathered to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.4	Thus the thing was right in the sight of the king and all the assembly. 
2CH.30.5	So they established a decree to circulate a proclamation throughout all Israel from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to celebrate the Passover to the L
2CH.30.6	The couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the hand of the king and his princes, even according to the command of the king, saying, “O sons of Israel, return to the L
2CH.30.7	Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were unfaithful to the L
2CH.30.8	Now do not stiffen your neck like your fathers, but yield to the L
2CH.30.9	For if you return to the L
2CH.30.10	So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun, but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them. 
2CH.30.11	Nevertheless some men of Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.12	The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of the L
2CH.30.13	Now many people were gathered at Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month, a very large assembly. 
2CH.30.14	They arose and removed the altars which 
2CH.30.15	Then they slaughtered the Passover 
2CH.30.16	They stood at their stations after their custom, according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood 
2CH.30.17	For 
2CH.30.18	For a multitude of the people, 
2CH.30.19	everyone who prepares his heart to seek God, the L
2CH.30.20	So the L
2CH.30.21	The sons of Israel present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread 
2CH.30.22	Then Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good insight 
2CH.30.23	Then the whole assembly decided to celebrate 
2CH.30.24	For Hezekiah king of Judah had contributed to the assembly 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep, and the princes had contributed to the assembly 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep; and a large number of priests consecrated themselves. 
2CH.30.25	All the assembly of Judah rejoiced, with the priests and the Levites and all the assembly that came from Israel, both the sojourners who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah. 
2CH.30.26	So there was great joy in Jerusalem, because there was nothing like this in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel. 
2CH.30.27	Then the Levitical priests arose and blessed the people; and their voice was heard and their prayer came to His holy dwelling place, to heaven.
2CH.31.1	Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, broke the pillars in pieces, cut down the 
2CH.31.2	And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites by their divisions, each according to his service, 
2CH.31.4	Also he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites, that they might devote themselves to the law of the L
2CH.31.5	As soon as the order spread, the sons of Israel provided in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, oil, honey and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of all. 
2CH.31.6	The sons of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of sacred gifts which were consecrated to the L
2CH.31.7	In the third month they began to make the heaps, and finished 
2CH.31.8	When Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw the heaps, they blessed the L
2CH.31.9	Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. 
2CH.31.10	Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok said to him, “Since the contributions began to be brought into the house of the L
2CH.31.11	Then Hezekiah commanded 
2CH.31.12	They faithfully brought in the contributions and the tithes and the consecrated things; and Conaniah the Levite 
2CH.31.13	Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath and Benaiah 
2CH.31.14	Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the eastern 
2CH.31.15	Under his authority 
2CH.31.16	without regard to their genealogical enrollment, to the males from thirty years old and upward—everyone who entered the house of the L
2CH.31.17	as well as the priests who were enrolled genealogically according to their fathers’ households, and the Levites from twenty years old and upwards, by their duties 
2CH.31.18	The genealogical enrollment 
2CH.31.19	Also for the sons of Aaron the priests 
2CH.31.20	Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah; and he did what 
2CH.31.21	Every work which he began in the service of the house of God in law and in commandment, seeking his God, he did with all his heart and prospered.
2CH.32.1	After these acts of faithfulness Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah and besieged the fortified cities, and thought to break into them for himself. 
2CH.32.2	Now when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to make war on Jerusalem, 
2CH.32.3	he decided with his officers and his warriors to cut off the 
2CH.32.4	So many people assembled and stopped up all the springs and the stream which flowed through the region, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find abundant water?” 
2CH.32.5	And he took courage and rebuilt all the wall that had been broken down and erected towers on it, and 
2CH.32.6	He appointed military officers over the people and gathered them to him in the square at the city gate, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying, 
2CH.32.7	“Be strong and courageous, do not fear or be dismayed because of the king of Assyria nor because of all the horde that is with him; for the one with us is greater than the one with him. 
2CH.32.8	With him is 
2CH.32.9	After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem while he 
2CH.32.10	“Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, ‘On what are you trusting that you are remaining in Jerusalem under siege? 
2CH.32.11	Is not Hezekiah misleading you to give yourselves over to die by hunger and by thirst, saying, “The L
2CH.32.12	Has not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, “You shall worship before one altar, and on it you shall burn incense”? 
2CH.32.13	Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands able at all to deliver their land from my hand? 
2CH.32.14	Who 
2CH.32.15	Now therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like this, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you from my hand?’ ”
2CH.32.16	His servants spoke further against the L
2CH.32.17	He also wrote letters to insult the L
2CH.32.18	They called this out with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them, so that they might take the city. 
2CH.32.19	They spoke of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of men’s hands.
2CH.32.20	But King Hezekiah and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed about this and cried out to heaven. 
2CH.32.21	And the L
2CH.32.22	So the L
2CH.32.23	And many were bringing gifts to the L
2CH.32.24	In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill; and he prayed to the L
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah gave no return for the benefit he received, because his heart was proud; therefore wrath came on him and on Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.32.26	However, Hezekiah humbled the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the L
2CH.32.27	Now Hezekiah had immense riches and honor; and he made for himself treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of valuable articles, 
2CH.32.28	storehouses also for the produce of grain, wine and oil, pens for all kinds of cattle and sheepfolds for the flocks. 
2CH.32.29	He made cities for himself and acquired flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very great wealth. 
2CH.32.30	It was Hezekiah who stopped the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all that he did. 
2CH.32.31	Even 
2CH.32.32	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his deeds of devotion, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.32.33	So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper section of the tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And his son Manasseh became king in his place.
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.2	He did evil in the sight of the L
2CH.33.3	For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; he also erected altars for the Baals and made 
2CH.33.4	He built altars in the house of the L
2CH.33.5	For he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the L
2CH.33.6	He made his sons pass through the fire in the valley of Ben-hinnom; and he practiced witchcraft, used divination, practiced sorcery and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the L
2CH.33.7	Then he put the carved image of the idol which he had made in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever; 
2CH.33.8	and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them according to all the law, the statutes and the ordinances 
2CH.33.9	Thus Manasseh misled Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the L
2CH.33.10	The L
2CH.33.11	Therefore the L
2CH.33.12	When he was in distress, he entreated the L
2CH.33.13	When he prayed to Him, He was moved by his entreaty and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the L
2CH.33.14	Now after this he built the outer wall of the city of David on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance of the Fish Gate; and he encircled the Ophel 
2CH.33.15	He also removed the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the L
2CH.33.16	He set up the altar of the L
2CH.33.17	Nevertheless the people still sacrificed in the high places, 
2CH.33.18	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh even his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the L
2CH.33.19	His prayer also and 
2CH.33.20	So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And Amon his son became king in his place.
2CH.33.21	Amon 
2CH.33.22	He did evil in the sight of the L
2CH.33.23	Moreover, he did not humble himself before the L
2CH.33.24	Finally his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house. 
2CH.33.25	But the people of the land killed all the conspirators against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
2CH.34.1	Josiah 
2CH.34.2	He did right in the sight of the L
2CH.34.3	For in the eighth year of his reign while he was still a youth, he began to seek the God of his father David; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherim, the carved images and the molten images. 
2CH.34.4	They tore down the altars of the Baals in his presence, and the incense altars that were high above them he chopped down; also the Asherim, the carved images and the molten images he broke in pieces and ground to powder and scattered 
2CH.34.5	Then he burned the bones of the priests on their altars and purged Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.6	In the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, even as far as Naphtali, in their surrounding ruins, 
2CH.34.7	he also tore down the altars and beat the Asherim and the carved images into powder, and chopped down all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.8	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah an official of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the L
2CH.34.9	They came to Hilkiah the high priest and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the doorkeepers, had collected from Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.10	Then they gave 
2CH.34.11	They in turn gave 
2CH.34.12	The men did the work faithfully with foremen over them to supervise: Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites of the sons of Merari, Zechariah and Meshullam of the sons of the Kohathites, and the Levites, all who were skillful with musical instruments. 
2CH.34.13	 also over the burden bearers, and supervised all the workmen from job to job; and 
2CH.34.14	When they were bringing out the money which had been brought into the house of the L
2CH.34.15	Hilkiah responded and said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the L
2CH.34.16	Then Shaphan brought the book to the king and reported further word to the king, saying, “Everything that was entrusted to your servants they are doing. 
2CH.34.17	They have also emptied out the money which was found in the house of the L
2CH.34.18	Moreover, Shaphan the scribe told the king saying, “Hilkiah the priest gave me a book.” And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.
2CH.34.19	When the king heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes. 
2CH.34.20	Then the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying, 
2CH.34.21	“Go, inquire of the L
2CH.34.22	So Hilkiah and 
2CH.34.23	She said to them, “Thus says the L
2CH.34.24	thus says the L
2CH.34.25	Because they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore My wrath will be poured out on this place and it shall not be quenched.” ’ 
2CH.34.26	But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the L
2CH.34.27	“Because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and against its inhabitants, and 
2CH.34.28	“Behold, I will gather you to your fathers and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, so your eyes will not see all the evil which I will bring on this place and on its inhabitants.” ’ ” And they brought back word to the king.
2CH.34.29	Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.30	The king went up to the house of the L
2CH.34.31	Then the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the L
2CH.34.32	Moreover, he made all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand 
2CH.34.33	Josiah removed all the abominations from all the lands belonging to the sons of Israel, and made all who were present in Israel to serve the L
2CH.35.1	Then Josiah celebrated the Passover to the L
2CH.35.2	He set the priests in their offices and encouraged them in the service of the house of the L
2CH.35.3	He also said to the Levites who taught all Israel 
2CH.35.4	Prepare 
2CH.35.5	Moreover, stand in the holy place according to the sections of the fathers’ households of your brethren the lay people, and according to the Levites, by division of a father’s household. 
2CH.35.6	Now slaughter the Passover 
2CH.35.7	Josiah contributed to the lay people, to all who were present, flocks of lambs and young goats, all for the Passover offerings, numbering 30,000 plus 3,000 bulls; these were from the king’s possessions. 
2CH.35.8	His officers also contributed a freewill offering to the people, the priests and the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the officials of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings 2,600 
2CH.35.9	Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the officers of the Levites, contributed to the Levites for the Passover offerings 5,000 
2CH.35.10	So the service was prepared, and the priests stood at their stations and the Levites by their divisions according to the king’s command. 
2CH.35.11	They slaughtered the Passover 
2CH.35.12	Then they removed the burnt offerings that 
2CH.35.13	So they roasted the Passover 
2CH.35.14	Afterwards they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, 
2CH.35.15	The singers, the sons of Asaph, 
2CH.35.16	So all the service of the L
2CH.35.17	Thus the sons of Israel who were present celebrated the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days. 
2CH.35.18	There had not been celebrated a Passover like it in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; nor had any of the kings of Israel celebrated such a Passover as Josiah did with the priests, the Levites, all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.35.19	In the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign this Passover was celebrated.
2CH.35.20	After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Neco king of Egypt came up to make war at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to engage him. 
2CH.35.21	But Neco sent messengers to him, saying, “What have we to do with each other, O King of Judah? 
2CH.35.22	However, Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to make war with him; nor did he listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but came to make war on the plain of Megiddo. 
2CH.35.23	The archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am badly wounded.” 
2CH.35.24	So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in the second chariot which he had, and brought him to Jerusalem where he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. 
2CH.35.25	Then Jeremiah chanted a lament for Josiah. And all the male and female singers speak about Josiah in their lamentations to this day. And they made them an ordinance in Israel; behold, they are also written in the Lamentations. 
2CH.35.26	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his deeds of devotion as written in the law of the L
2CH.35.27	and his acts, first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
2CH.36.1	Then the people of the land took 
2CH.36.2	Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.3	Then the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and imposed on the land a fine of one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold. 
2CH.36.4	The king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Joahaz his brother and brought him to Egypt.
2CH.36.5	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and he did evil in the sight of the L
2CH.36.6	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him and bound him with bronze 
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar also brought 
2CH.36.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and the abominations which he did, and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son became king in his place.
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem, and he did evil in the sight of the L
2CH.36.10	At the turn of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon with the valuable articles of the house of the L
2CH.36.11	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.12	He did evil in the sight of the L
2CH.36.13	He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear 
2CH.36.14	Furthermore, all the officials of the priests and the people were very unfaithful 
2CH.36.15	The L
2CH.36.16	but they 
2CH.36.17	Therefore He brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or infirm; He gave 
2CH.36.18	All the articles of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the L
2CH.36.19	Then they burned the house of God and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burned all its fortified buildings with fire and destroyed all its valuable articles. 
2CH.36.20	Those who had escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and to his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia, 
2CH.36.21	to fulfill the word of the L
2CH.36.22	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia—in order to fulfill the word of the L
2CH.36.23	“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, ‘The L
EZR.1.1	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the L
EZR.1.2	“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, ‘The L
EZR.1.3	Whoever there is among you of all His people, may his God be with him! Let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and rebuild the house of the L
EZR.1.4	Every survivor, at whatever place he may live, let the men of that place support him with silver and gold, with goods and cattle, together with a freewill offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.’ ”
EZR.1.5	Then the heads of fathers’ 
EZR.1.6	All those about them encouraged them with articles of silver, with gold, with goods, with cattle and with valuables, aside from all that was given as a freewill offering. 
EZR.1.7	Also King Cyrus brought out the articles of the house of the L
EZR.1.8	and Cyrus, king of Persia, had them brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and he counted them out to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. 
EZR.1.9	Now this

EZR.2.69	According to their ability they gave to the treasury for the work 61,000 gold drachmas and 5,000 silver minas and 100 priestly garments.
EZR.2.70	Now the priests and the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers and the temple servants lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
EZR.3.1	Now when the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel 
EZR.3.2	Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers arose and built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God. 
EZR.3.3	So they set up the altar on its foundation, for they were terrified because of the peoples of the lands; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the L
EZR.3.4	They celebrated the Feast of 
EZR.3.5	and afterward 
EZR.3.6	From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the L
EZR.3.7	Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and food, drink and oil to the Sidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring cedar wood from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa, according to the permission they had from Cyrus king of Persia.
EZR.3.8	Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem, began 
EZR.3.9	Then Jeshua 
EZR.3.10	Now when the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of the L
EZR.3.11	They sang, praising and giving thanks to the L
EZR.3.12	Yet many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ 
EZR.3.13	so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the shout of joy from the sound of the weeping of the people, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard far away.
EZR.4.1	Now when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people of the exile were building a temple to the L
EZR.4.2	they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of fathers’ 
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers’ 
EZR.4.4	Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah, and frightened them from building, 
EZR.4.5	and hired counselors against them to frustrate their counsel all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
EZR.4.6	Now in the reign of 
EZR.4.7	And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his colleagues wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the text of the letter was written in Aramaic and translated 
EZR.4.8	Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes, as follows— 
EZR.4.9	then 
EZR.4.10	and the rest of the nations which the great and honorable Osnappar deported and settled in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the region beyond the 
EZR.4.11	this is the copy of the letter which they sent to him:
EZR.4.11	“
EZR.4.12	let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem; they are rebuilding the rebellious and evil city and are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations. 
EZR.4.13	Now let it be known to the king, that if that city is rebuilt and the walls are finished, they will not pay tribute, custom or toll, and it will damage the revenue of the kings. 
EZR.4.14	Now because we are in the service of the palace, and it is not fitting for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore we have sent and informed the king, 
EZR.4.15	so that a search may be made in the record books of your fathers. And you will discover in the record books and learn that that city is a rebellious city and damaging to kings and provinces, and that they have incited revolt within it in past days; therefore that city was laid waste. 
EZR.4.16	We inform the king that if that city is rebuilt and the walls finished, as a result you will have no possession in 
EZR.4.18	the document which you sent to us has been translated and read before me. 
EZR.4.19	A decree has been issued by me, and a search has been made and it has been discovered that that city has risen up against the kings in past days, that rebellion and revolt have been perpetrated in it, 
EZR.4.20	that mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem, governing all 
EZR.4.21	So, now issue a decree to make these men stop 
EZR.4.22	Beware of being negligent in carrying out this 
EZR.4.23	Then as soon as the copy of King Artaxerxes’ document was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their colleagues, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force of arms.
EZR.4.24	Then work on the house of God in Jerusalem ceased, and it was stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
EZR.5.1	When the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them, 
EZR.5.2	then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God were with them supporting them.
EZR.5.3	At that time Tattenai, the governor of 
EZR.5.4	Then we told them accordingly what the names of the men were who were reconstructing this building. 
EZR.5.5	But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until a report could come to Darius, and then a written reply be returned concerning it.
EZR.5.7	They sent a report to him in which it was written thus: “To Darius the king, all peace. 
EZR.5.8	Let it be known to the king that we have gone to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is being built with huge stones, and beams are being laid in the walls; and this work is going on with great care and is succeeding in their hands. 
EZR.5.9	Then we asked those elders and said to them thus, ‘Who issued you a decree to rebuild this temple and to finish this structure?’ 
EZR.5.10	We also asked them their names so as to inform you, and that we might write down the names of the men who were at their head. 
EZR.5.11	Thus they answered us, saying, ‘We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished. 
EZR.5.12	But because our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, 
EZR.5.13	However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God. 
EZR.5.14	Also the gold and silver utensils of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, and brought them to the temple of Babylon, these King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon and they were given to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor. 
EZR.5.15	He said to him, “Take these utensils, go 
EZR.5.16	Then that Sheshbazzar came 
EZR.5.17	Now if it pleases the king, let a search be conducted in the king’s treasure house, which is there in Babylon, if it be that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to rebuild this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send to us his decision concerning this 
EZR.6.1	Then King Darius issued a decree, and search was made in the

EZR.6.3	In the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus the king issued a decree: ‘
EZR.6.4	with three layers of huge stones and one layer of timbers. And let the cost be paid from the royal treasury. 
EZR.6.5	Also let the gold and silver utensils of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned and brought to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; and you shall put 
EZR.6.6	“Now 
EZR.6.7	Leave this work on the house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its site. 
EZR.6.8	Moreover, I issue a decree concerning what you are to do for these elders of Judah in the rebuilding of this house of God: the full cost is to be paid to these people from the royal treasury out of the taxes of 
EZR.6.9	Whatever is needed, both young bulls, rams, and lambs for a burnt offering to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine and anointing oil, as the priests in Jerusalem request, 
EZR.6.10	that they may offer 
EZR.6.11	And I issued a decree that any man who violates this edict, a timber shall be drawn from his house and he shall be impaled on it and his house shall be made a refuse heap on account of this. 
EZR.6.12	May the God who has caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who attempts to change 
EZR.6.13	Then Tattenai, the governor of 
EZR.6.14	And the elders of the Jews were successful in building through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they finished building according to the command of the God of Israel and the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. 
EZR.6.15	This temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar; it was the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
EZR.6.16	And the sons of Israel, the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy. 
EZR.6.17	They offered for the dedication of this temple of God 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel 12 male goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel. 
EZR.6.18	Then they appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites in their orders for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.
EZR.6.19	The exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth of the first month. 
EZR.6.20	For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure. Then they slaughtered the Passover 
EZR.6.21	The sons of Israel who returned from exile and all those who had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations of the land to 
EZR.6.22	And they observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy, for the L
EZR.7.1	Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, 
EZR.7.2	son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub, 
EZR.7.3	son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth, 
EZR.7.4	son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest. 
EZR.7.6	This Ezra went up from Babylon, and he was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses, which the L
EZR.7.7	Some of the sons of Israel and some of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
EZR.7.8	He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. 
EZR.7.9	For on the first of the first month he began to go up from Babylon; and on the first of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, because the good hand of his God 
EZR.7.10	For Ezra had set his heart to study the law of the L
EZR.7.11	Now this is the copy of the decree which King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, learned in the words of the commandments of the L
EZR.7.12	“Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect 
EZR.7.13	I have issued a decree that any of the people of Israel and their priests and the Levites in my kingdom who are willing to go to Jerusalem, may go with you. 
EZR.7.14	Forasmuch as you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God which is in your hand, 
EZR.7.15	and to bring the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem, 
EZR.7.16	with all the silver and gold which you find in the whole province of Babylon, along with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests, who offered willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem; 
EZR.7.17	with this money, therefore, you shall diligently buy bulls, rams and lambs, with their grain offerings and their drink offerings and offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.18	Whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold, you may do according to the will of your God. 
EZR.7.19	Also the utensils which are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.20	The rest of the needs for the house of your God, for which you may have occasion to provide, provide 
EZR.7.21	“I, even I, King Artaxerxes, issue a decree to all the treasurers who are 
EZR.7.22	 up to 100 talents of silver, 100 kors of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of oil, and salt as needed. 
EZR.7.23	Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done with zeal for the house of the God of heaven, so that there will not be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons. 
EZR.7.24	We also inform you that it is not allowed to impose tax, tribute or toll 
EZR.7.25	“You, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God which is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges that they may judge all the people who are in 
EZR.7.26	Whoever will not observe the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him strictly, whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of goods or for imprisonment.”
EZR.7.27	Blessed be the L
EZR.7.28	and has extended lovingkindness to me before the king and his counselors and before all the king’s mighty princes. Thus I was strengthened according to the hand of the L
EZR.8.1	Now these are the heads of their fathers’ 
EZR.8.2	of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Hattush; 
EZR.8.3	of the sons of Shecaniah 
EZR.8.4	of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah and 200 males with him; 
EZR.8.5	of the sons of Zattu, Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel and 300 males with him; 
EZR.8.6	and of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan and 50 males with him; 
EZR.8.7	and of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah and 70 males with him; 
EZR.8.8	and of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael and 80 males with him; 
EZR.8.9	of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel and 218 males with him; 
EZR.8.10	and of the sons of Bani, Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah and 160 males with him; 
EZR.8.11	and of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai and 28 males with him; 
EZR.8.12	and of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan and 110 males with him; 
EZR.8.13	and of the sons of Adonikam, the last ones, these being their names, Eliphelet, Jeuel and Shemaiah, and 60 males with them; 
EZR.8.14	and of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and 70 males with them.
EZR.8.15	Now I assembled them at the river that runs to Ahava, where we camped for three days; and when I observed the people and the priests, I did not find any Levites there. 
EZR.8.16	So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, leading men, and for Joiarib and Elnathan, teachers. 
EZR.8.17	I sent them to Iddo the leading man at the place Casiphia; and I told them what to say to Iddo 
EZR.8.18	According to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of insight of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, and his sons and brothers, 18 men; 
EZR.8.19	and Hashabiah and Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, 20 men; 
EZR.8.20	and 220 of the temple servants, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, all of them designated by name.
EZR.8.21	Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from Him a safe journey for us, our little ones, and all our possessions. 
EZR.8.22	For I was ashamed to request from the king troops and horsemen to protect us from the enemy on the way, because we had said to the king, “The hand of our God is favorably disposed to all those who seek Him, but His power and His anger are against all those who forsake Him.” 
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and sought our God concerning this 
EZR.8.24	Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten of their brothers; 
EZR.8.25	and I weighed out to them the silver, the gold and the utensils, the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his princes and all Israel present 
EZR.8.26	Thus I weighed into their hands 650 talents of silver, and silver utensils 
EZR.8.27	and 20 gold bowls 
EZR.8.28	Then I said to them, “You are holy to the L
EZR.8.29	Watch and keep 
EZR.8.30	So the priests and the Levites accepted the weighed out silver and gold and the utensils, to bring 
EZR.8.31	Then we journeyed from the river Ahava on the twelfth of the first month to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was over us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the ambushes by the way. 
EZR.8.32	Thus we came to Jerusalem and remained there three days.
EZR.8.33	On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the utensils were weighed out in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him 
EZR.8.34	Everything 
EZR.8.35	The exiles who had come from the captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, 12 male goats for a sin offering, all as a burnt offering to the L
EZR.8.36	Then they delivered the king’s edicts to the king’s satraps and to the governors 
EZR.9.1	Now when these things had been completed, the princes approached me, saying, “The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, according to their abominations, 
EZR.9.2	For they have taken some of their daughters 
EZR.9.3	When I heard about this matter, I tore my garment and my robe, and pulled some of the hair from my head and my beard, and sat down appalled. 
EZR.9.4	Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel on account of the unfaithfulness of the exiles gathered to me, and I sat appalled until the evening offering.
EZR.9.5	But at the evening offering I arose from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn, and I fell on my knees and stretched out my hands to the L
EZR.9.6	and I said, “O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to You, my God, for our iniquities have risen above our heads and our guilt has grown even to the heavens. 
EZR.9.7	Since the days of our fathers to this day we 
EZR.9.8	But now for a brief moment grace has been 
EZR.9.9	For we are slaves; yet in our bondage our God has not forsaken us, but has extended lovingkindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us reviving to raise up the house of our God, to restore its ruins and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.9.10	“Now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments, 
EZR.9.11	which You have commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from end to end 
EZR.9.12	So now do not give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters to your sons, and never seek their peace or their prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good 
EZR.9.13	After all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and our great guilt, since You our God have requited 
EZR.9.14	shall we again break Your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who commit these abominations? Would You not be angry with us to the point of destruction, until there is no remnant nor any who escape? 
EZR.9.15	O L
EZR.10.1	Now while Ezra was praying and making confession, weeping and prostrating himself before the house of God, a very large assembly, men, women and children, gathered to him from Israel; for the people wept bitterly. 
EZR.10.2	Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope for Israel in spite of this. 
EZR.10.3	So now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives and their children, according to the counsel of 
EZR.10.4	Arise! For 
EZR.10.5	Then Ezra rose and made the leading priests, the Levites and all Israel, take oath that they would do according to this proposal; so they took the oath. 
EZR.10.6	Then Ezra rose from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib. Although he went there, he did not eat bread nor drink water, for he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles. 
EZR.10.7	They made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the exiles, that they should assemble at Jerusalem, 
EZR.10.8	and that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the leaders and the elders, all his possessions should be forfeited and he himself excluded from the assembly of the exiles.
EZR.10.9	So all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month on the twentieth of the month, and all the people sat in the open square 
EZR.10.10	Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful and have married foreign wives adding to the guilt of Israel. 
EZR.10.11	Now therefore, make confession to the L
EZR.10.12	Then all the assembly replied with a loud voice, “That’s right! As you have said, so it is our duty to do. 
EZR.10.13	But there are many people; it is the rainy season and we are not able to stand in the open. Nor 
EZR.10.14	Let our leaders represent the whole assembly and let all those in our cities who have married foreign wives come at appointed times, together with the elders and judges of each city, until the fierce anger of our God on account of this matter is turned away from us.” 
EZR.10.15	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this, with Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supporting them.
EZR.10.16	But the exiles did so. And Ezra the priest selected men 
EZR.10.17	They finished 
EZR.10.18	Among the sons of the priests who had married foreign wives were found of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah. 
EZR.10.19	They pledged to put away their wives, and being guilty, 
EZR.10.20	Of the sons of Immer 
EZR.10.21	and of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel and Uzziah; 
EZR.10.22	and of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad and Elasah.
EZR.10.23	Of Levites 
EZR.10.24	Of the singers 
EZR.10.25	Of Israel, of the sons of Parosh 
EZR.10.26	and of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth and Elijah; 
EZR.10.27	and of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad and Aziza; 
EZR.10.28	and of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai 
EZR.10.29	and of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch and Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal 
EZR.10.30	and of the sons of Pahath-moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui and Manasseh; 
EZR.10.31	and 
EZR.10.32	Benjamin, Malluch 
EZR.10.33	of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh 
EZR.10.34	of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel, 
EZR.10.35	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi,

EZR.10.41	Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, 
EZR.10.42	Shallum, Amariah 
EZR.10.43	Of the sons of Nebo 
EZR.10.44	All these had married foreign wives, and some of them had wives 
NEH.1.1	The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.
NEH.1.2	that Hanani, one of my brothers, and some men from Judah came; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped 
NEH.1.3	They said to me, “The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are burned with fire.”
NEH.1.4	When I heard these words, I sat down and wept and mourned for days; and I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven. 
NEH.1.5	I said, “I beseech You, O L
NEH.1.6	let Your ear now be attentive and Your eyes open to hear the prayer of Your servant which I am praying before You now, day and night, on behalf of the sons of Israel Your servants, confessing the sins of the sons of Israel which we have sinned against You; I and my father’s house have sinned. 
NEH.1.7	We have acted very corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses. 
NEH.1.8	Remember the word which You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful I will scatter you among the peoples; 
NEH.1.9	but 
NEH.1.10	They are Your servants and Your people whom You redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand. 
NEH.1.11	O Lord, I beseech You, may Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and the prayer of Your servants who delight to revere Your name, and make Your servant successful today and grant him compassion before this man.”
NEH.2.1	And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, that wine 
NEH.2.2	So the king said to me, “Why is your face sad though you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart.” Then I was very much afraid. 
NEH.2.3	I said to the king, “Let the king live forever. Why should my face not be sad when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies desolate and its gates have been consumed by fire?” 
NEH.2.4	Then the king said to me, “What would you request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven. 
NEH.2.5	I said to the king, “If it please the king, and if your servant has found favor before you, send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may rebuild it.” 
NEH.2.6	Then the king said to me, the queen sitting beside him, “How long will your journey be, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a definite time. 
NEH.2.7	And I said to the king, “If it please the king, let letters be given me for the governors 
NEH.2.8	and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which is by the 
NEH.2.9	Then I came to the governors 
NEH.2.10	When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard 
NEH.2.11	So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days. 
NEH.2.12	And I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anyone what my God was putting into my mind to do for Jerusalem and there was no animal with me except the animal on which I was riding. 
NEH.2.13	So I went out at night by the Valley Gate in the direction of the Dragon’s Well and 
NEH.2.14	Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was no place for my mount to pass. 
NEH.2.15	So I went up at night by the ravine and inspected the wall. Then I entered the Valley Gate again and returned. 
NEH.2.16	The officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; nor had I as yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials or the rest who did the work.
NEH.2.17	Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation we are in, that Jerusalem is desolate and its gates burned by fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a reproach.” 
NEH.2.18	I told them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me and also about the king’s words which he had spoken to me. Then they said, “Let us arise and build.” So they put their hands to the good 
NEH.2.19	But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard 
NEH.2.20	So I answered them and said to them, “The God of heaven will give us success; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no portion, right or memorial in Jerusalem.”
NEH.3.1	Then Eliashib the high priest arose with his brothers the priests and built the Sheep Gate; they consecrated it and hung its doors. They consecrated the wall to the Tower of the Hundred 
NEH.3.2	Next to him the men of Jericho built, and next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built.

NEH.3.20	After him Baruch the son of Zabbai zealously repaired another section, from the Angle to the doorway of the house of Eliashib the high priest. 
NEH.3.21	After him Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz repaired another section, from the doorway of Eliashib’s house even as far as the end of his house.

NEH.3.32	Between the upper room of the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and the merchants carried out repairs.
NEH.4.1	Now it came about that when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious and very angry and mocked the Jews. 
NEH.4.2	He spoke in the presence of his brothers and the wealthy 
NEH.4.3	Now Tobiah the Ammonite 
NEH.4.4	Hear, O our God, how we are despised! Return their reproach on their own heads and give them up for plunder in a land of captivity. 
NEH.4.5	Do not forgive their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out before You, for they have demoralized the builders.
NEH.4.6	So we built the wall and the whole wall was joined together to half its 
NEH.4.7	Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repair of the walls of Jerusalem went on, 
NEH.4.8	All of them conspired together to come 
NEH.4.9	But we prayed to our God, and because of them we set up a guard against them day and night.
NEH.4.10	Thus in Judah it was said,
NEH.4.10	“The strength of the burden bearers is failing,
NEH.4.10	Yet there is much rubbish;
NEH.4.10	And we ourselves are unable
NEH.4.10	To rebuild the wall.”
NEH.4.11	Our enemies said, “They will not know or see until we come among them, kill them and put a stop to the work.” 
NEH.4.12	When the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times, “They will come up against us from every place where you may turn,” 
NEH.4.13	then I stationed 
NEH.4.14	When I saw 
NEH.4.15	When our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had frustrated their plan, then all of us returned to the wall, each one to his work. 
NEH.4.16	From that day on, half of my servants carried on the work while half of them held the spears, the shields, the bows and the breastplates; and the captains 
NEH.4.17	Those who were rebuilding the wall and those who carried burdens took 
NEH.4.18	As for the builders, each 
NEH.4.19	I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The work is great and extensive, and we are separated on the wall far from one another. 
NEH.4.20	At whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.”
NEH.4.21	So we carried on the work with half of them holding spears from dawn until the stars appeared. 
NEH.4.22	At that time I also said to the people, “Let each man with his servant spend the night within Jerusalem so that they may be a guard for us by night and a laborer by day.” 
NEH.4.23	So neither I, my brothers, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us removed our clothes, each 
NEH.5.1	Now there was a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brothers. 
NEH.5.2	For there were those who said, “We, our sons and our daughters are many; therefore let us get grain that we may eat and live.” 
NEH.5.3	There were others who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our houses that we might get grain because of the famine.” 
NEH.5.4	Also there were those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tax 
NEH.5.5	Now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our children like their children. Yet behold, we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters are forced into bondage 
NEH.5.6	Then I was very angry when I had heard their outcry and these words. 
NEH.5.7	I consulted with myself and contended with the nobles and the rulers and said to them, “You are exacting usury, each from his brother!” Therefore, I held a great assembly against them. 
NEH.5.8	I said to them, “We according to our ability have redeemed our Jewish brothers who were sold to the nations; now would you even sell your brothers that they may be sold to us?” Then they were silent and could not find a word 
NEH.5.9	Again I said, “The thing which you are doing is not good; should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies? 
NEH.5.10	And likewise I, my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Please, let us leave off this usury. 
NEH.5.11	Please, give back to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves and their houses, also the hundredth 
NEH.5.12	Then they said, “We will give 
NEH.5.13	I also shook out the front of my garment and said, “Thus may God shake out every man from his house and from his possessions who does not fulfill this promise; even thus may he be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said, “Amen!” And they praised the L
NEH.5.14	Moreover, from the day that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, 
NEH.5.15	But the former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people and took from them bread and wine besides forty shekels of silver; even their servants domineered the people. But I did not do so because of the fear of God. 
NEH.5.16	I also 
NEH.5.17	Moreover, 
NEH.5.18	Now that which was prepared for each day was one ox 
NEH.5.19	Remember me, O my God, for good, 
NEH.6.1	Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, to Geshem the Arab and to the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall, and 
NEH.6.2	then Sanballat and Geshem sent 
NEH.6.3	So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?” 
NEH.6.4	They sent 
NEH.6.5	Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same manner a fifth time with an open letter in his hand. 
NEH.6.6	In it was written, “It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel; therefore you are rebuilding the wall. And you are to be their king, according to these reports. 
NEH.6.7	You have also appointed prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, ‘A king is in Judah!’ And now it will be reported to the king according to these reports. So come now, let us take counsel together.” 
NEH.6.8	Then I sent 
NEH.6.9	For all of them were 
NEH.6.10	When I entered the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home, he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you, and they are coming to kill you at night.” 
NEH.6.11	But I said, “Should a man like me flee? And could one such as I go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.” 
NEH.6.12	Then I perceived that surely God had not sent him, but he uttered 
NEH.6.13	He was hired for this reason, that I might become frightened and act accordingly and sin, so that they might have an evil report in order that they could reproach me. 
NEH.6.14	Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these works of theirs, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets who were 
NEH.6.15	So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of 
NEH.6.16	When all our enemies heard 
NEH.6.17	Also in those days many letters went from the nobles of Judah to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s 
NEH.6.18	For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. 
NEH.6.19	Moreover, they were speaking about his good deeds in my presence and reported my words to him. Then Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.
NEH.7.1	Now when the wall was rebuilt and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed, 
NEH.7.2	then I put Hanani my brother, and Hananiah the commander of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many. 
NEH.7.3	Then I said to them, “Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot, and while they are standing 
NEH.7.4	Now the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were few and the houses were not built.
NEH.7.5	Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the people to be enrolled by genealogies. Then I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up first in which I found the following record:
NEH.7.6	These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his city,

NEH.7.66	The whole assembly together 
NEH.7.67	besides their male and their female servants, of whom

NEH.7.71	Some of the heads of fathers’ 
NEH.7.72	That which the rest of the people gave was 20,000 gold drachmas and 2,000 silver minas and 67 priests’ garments.
NEH.7.73	Now the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants and all Israel, lived in their cities.
NEH.8.1	And all the people gathered as one man at the square which was in front of the Water Gate, and they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the L
NEH.8.2	Then Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly of men, women and all who 
NEH.8.3	He read from it before the square which was in front of the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of men and women, those who could understand; and all the people were attentive to the book of the law. 
NEH.8.4	Ezra the scribe stood at a wooden podium which they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right hand; and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah 
NEH.8.5	Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. 
NEH.8.6	Then Ezra blessed the L
NEH.8.7	Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites, explained the law to the people while the people 
NEH.8.8	They read from the book, from the law of God, translating to give the sense so that they understood the reading.
NEH.8.9	Then Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest 
NEH.8.10	Then he said to them, “Go, eat of the fat, drink of the sweet, and send portions to him who has nothing prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not be grieved, for the joy of the L
NEH.8.11	So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be still, for the day is holy; do not be grieved.” 
NEH.8.12	All the people went away to eat, to drink, to send portions and to celebrate a great festival, because they understood the words which had been made known to them.
NEH.8.13	Then on the second day the heads of fathers’ 
NEH.8.14	They found written in the law how the L
NEH.8.15	So they proclaimed and circulated a proclamation in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the hills, and bring olive branches and wild olive branches, myrtle branches, palm branches and branches of 
NEH.8.16	So the people went out and brought 
NEH.8.17	The entire assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and lived in them. The sons of Israel had indeed not done so from the days of Joshua the son of Nun to that day. And there was great rejoicing. 
NEH.8.18	He read from the book of the law of God daily, from the first day to the last day. And they celebrated the feast seven days, and on the eighth day 
NEH.9.1	Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the sons of Israel assembled with fasting, in sackcloth and with dirt upon them. 
NEH.9.2	The descendants of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers. 
NEH.9.3	While they stood in their place, they read from the book of the law of the L
NEH.9.4	Now on the Levites’ platform stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani 
NEH.9.5	Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah 
NEH.9.5	O may Your glorious name be blessed
NEH.9.5	And exalted above all blessing and praise!
NEH.9.6	You alone are the L
NEH.9.6	You have made the heavens,
NEH.9.6	The heaven of heavens with all their host,
NEH.9.6	The earth and all that is on it,
NEH.9.6	The seas and all that is in them.
NEH.9.6	You give life to all of them
NEH.9.6	And the heavenly host bows down before You.
NEH.9.7	You are the L
NEH.9.7	Who chose Abram
NEH.9.7	And brought him out from Ur of the Chaldees,
NEH.9.7	And gave him the name Abraham.
NEH.9.8	You found his heart faithful before You,
NEH.9.8	And made a covenant with him
NEH.9.8	To give 
NEH.9.8	Of the Hittite and the Amorite,
NEH.9.8	Of the Perizzite, the Jebusite and the Girgashite—
NEH.9.8	To give 
NEH.9.8	And You have fulfilled Your promise,
NEH.9.8	For You are righteous.
NEH.9.9	“You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt,
NEH.9.9	And heard their cry by the Red Sea.
NEH.9.10	Then You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,
NEH.9.10	Against all his servants and all the people of his land;
NEH.9.10	For You knew that they acted arrogantly toward them,
NEH.9.10	And made a name for Yourself as 
NEH.9.11	You divided the sea before them,
NEH.9.11	So they passed through the midst of the sea on dry ground;
NEH.9.11	And their pursuers You hurled into the depths,
NEH.9.11	Like a stone into raging waters.
NEH.9.12	And with a pillar of cloud You led them by day,
NEH.9.12	And with a pillar of fire by night
NEH.9.12	To light for them the way
NEH.9.12	In which they were to go.
NEH.9.13	Then You came down on Mount Sinai,
NEH.9.13	And spoke with them from heaven;
NEH.9.13	You gave them just ordinances and true laws,
NEH.9.13	Good statutes and commandments.
NEH.9.14	So You made known to them Your holy sabbath,
NEH.9.14	And laid down for them commandments, statutes and law,
NEH.9.14	Through Your servant Moses.
NEH.9.15	You provided bread from heaven for them for their hunger,
NEH.9.15	You brought forth water from a rock for them for their thirst,
NEH.9.15	And You told them to enter in order to possess
NEH.9.15	The land which You swore to give them.
NEH.9.16	“But they, our fathers, acted arrogantly;
NEH.9.16	They 
NEH.9.17	They refused to listen,
NEH.9.17	And did not remember Your wondrous deeds which You had performed among them;
NEH.9.17	So they became stubborn and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt.
NEH.9.17	But You are a God of forgiveness,
NEH.9.17	Gracious and compassionate,
NEH.9.17	Slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness;
NEH.9.17	And You did not forsake them.
NEH.9.18	Even when they made for themselves
NEH.9.18	A calf of molten metal
NEH.9.18	And said, ‘This is your God
NEH.9.18	Who brought you up from Egypt,’
NEH.9.18	And committed great 
NEH.9.19	You, in Your great compassion,
NEH.9.19	Did not forsake them in the wilderness;
NEH.9.19	The pillar of cloud did not leave them by day,
NEH.9.19	To guide them on their way,
NEH.9.19	Nor the pillar of fire by night, to light for them the way in which they were to go.
NEH.9.20	You gave Your good Spirit to instruct them,
NEH.9.20	Your manna You did not withhold from their mouth,
NEH.9.20	And You gave them water for their thirst.
NEH.9.21	Indeed, forty years You provided for them in the wilderness 
NEH.9.21	Their clothes did not wear out, nor did their feet swell.
NEH.9.22	You also gave them kingdoms and peoples,
NEH.9.22	And allotted 
NEH.9.22	They took possession of the land of Sihon the king of Heshbon
NEH.9.22	And the land of Og the king of Bashan.
NEH.9.23	You made their sons numerous as the stars of heaven,
NEH.9.23	And You brought them into the land
NEH.9.23	Which You had told their fathers to enter and possess.
NEH.9.24	So their sons entered and possessed the land.
NEH.9.24	And You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites,
NEH.9.24	And You gave them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land,
NEH.9.24	To do with them as they desired.
NEH.9.25	They captured fortified cities and a fertile land.
NEH.9.25	They took possession of houses full of every good thing,
NEH.9.25	Hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves,
NEH.9.25	Fruit trees in abundance.
NEH.9.25	So they ate, were filled and grew fat,
NEH.9.25	And reveled in Your great goodness.
NEH.9.26	“But they became disobedient and rebelled against You,
NEH.9.26	And cast Your law behind their backs
NEH.9.26	And killed Your prophets who had admonished them
NEH.9.26	So that they might return to You,
NEH.9.26	And they committed great 
NEH.9.27	Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their oppressors who oppressed them,
NEH.9.27	But when they cried to You in the time of their distress,
NEH.9.27	You heard from heaven, and according to Your great compassion
NEH.9.27	You gave them deliverers who delivered them from the hand of their oppressors.
NEH.9.28	But as soon as they had rest, they did evil again before You;
NEH.9.28	Therefore You abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so that they ruled over them.
NEH.9.28	When they cried again to You, You heard from heaven,
NEH.9.28	And many times You rescued them according to Your compassion,
NEH.9.29	And admonished them in order to turn them back to Your law.
NEH.9.29	Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to Your commandments but sinned against Your ordinances,
NEH.9.29	By which if a man observes them he shall live.
NEH.9.29	And they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck, and would not listen.
NEH.9.30	However, You bore with them for many years,
NEH.9.30	And admonished them by Your Spirit through Your prophets,
NEH.9.30	Yet they would not give ear.
NEH.9.30	Therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
NEH.9.31	Nevertheless, in Your great compassion You did not make an end of them or forsake them,
NEH.9.31	For You are a gracious and compassionate God.
NEH.9.32	“Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and lovingkindness,
NEH.9.32	Do not let all the hardship seem insignificant before You,
NEH.9.32	Which has come upon us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers and on all Your people,
NEH.9.32	From the days of the kings of Assyria to this day.
NEH.9.33	However, You are just in all that has come upon us;
NEH.9.33	For You have dealt faithfully, but we have acted wickedly.
NEH.9.34	For our kings, our leaders, our priests and our fathers have not kept Your law
NEH.9.34	Or paid attention to Your commandments and Your admonitions with which You have admonished them.
NEH.9.35	But they, in their own kingdom,
NEH.9.35	With Your great goodness which You gave them,
NEH.9.35	With the broad and rich land which You set before them,
NEH.9.35	Did not serve You or turn from their evil deeds.
NEH.9.36	Behold, we are slaves today,
NEH.9.36	And as to the land which You gave to our fathers to eat of its fruit and its bounty,
NEH.9.36	Behold, we are slaves in it.
NEH.9.37	Its abundant produce is for the kings
NEH.9.37	Whom You have set over us because of our sins;
NEH.9.37	They also rule over our bodies
NEH.9.37	And over our cattle as they please,
NEH.9.37	So we are in great distress.
NEH.9.38	“Now because of all this

NEH.10.14	The leaders of the people: Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, 
NEH.10.15	Bunni, Azgad, Bebai, 
NEH.10.16	Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin, 
NEH.10.17	Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur, 
NEH.10.18	Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai, 
NEH.10.19	Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai, 
NEH.10.20	Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir, 
NEH.10.21	Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua, 
NEH.10.22	Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah, 
NEH.10.23	Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub, 
NEH.10.24	Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek, 
NEH.10.25	Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah, 
NEH.10.26	Ahiah, Hanan, Anan, 
NEH.10.27	Malluch, Harim, Baanah.
NEH.10.28	Now the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the law of God, their wives, their sons and their daughters, all those who had knowledge and understanding, 
NEH.10.29	are joining with their kinsmen, their nobles, and are taking on themselves a curse and an oath to walk in God’s law, which was given through Moses, God’s servant, and to keep and to observe all the commandments of G
NEH.10.30	and that we will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land or take their daughters for our sons. 
NEH.10.31	As for the peoples of the land who bring wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell, we will not buy from them on the sabbath or a holy day; and we will forego 
NEH.10.32	We also placed ourselves under obligation to contribute yearly one third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God: 
NEH.10.33	for the showbread, for the continual grain offering, for the continual burnt offering, the sabbaths, the new moon, for the appointed times, for the holy things and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and all the work of the house of our God.
NEH.10.34	Likewise we cast lots for the supply of wood 
NEH.10.35	and that they might bring the first fruits of our ground and the first fruits of all the fruit of every tree to the house of the L
NEH.10.36	and bring to the house of our God the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, and the firstborn of our herds and our flocks as it is written in the law, for the priests who are ministering in the house of our God. 
NEH.10.37	We will also bring the first of our dough, our contributions, the fruit of every tree, the new wine and the oil to the priests at the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithe of our ground to the Levites, for the Levites are they who receive the tithes in all the rural towns. 
NEH.10.38	The priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes, and the Levites shall bring up the tenth of the tithes to the house of our God, to the chambers of the storehouse. 
NEH.10.39	For the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the contribution of the grain, the new wine and the oil to the chambers; there are the utensils of the sanctuary, the priests who are ministering, the gatekeepers and the singers. Thus we will not neglect the house of our God.
NEH.11.1	Now the leaders of the people lived in Jerusalem, but the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while nine-tenths 
NEH.11.2	And the people blessed all the men who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.
NEH.11.3	Now these are the heads of the provinces who lived in Jerusalem, but in the cities of Judah each lived on his own property in their cities—the Israelites, the priests, the Levites, the temple servants and the descendants of Solomon’s servants. 
NEH.11.4	Some of the sons of Judah and some of the sons of Benjamin lived in Jerusalem. From the sons of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the sons of Perez; 
NEH.11.5	and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite. 
NEH.11.6	All the sons of Perez who lived in Jerusalem were 468 able men.
NEH.11.7	Now these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah; 
NEH.11.8	and after him Gabbai 
NEH.11.9	Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer, and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second in command of the city.
NEH.11.10	From the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin, 
NEH.11.11	Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the leader of the house of God, 
NEH.11.12	and their 
NEH.11.13	and his kinsmen, heads of fathers’ 
NEH.11.14	and their brothers, valiant warriors, 128. And their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of Haggedolim.
NEH.11.15	Now from the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; 
NEH.11.16	and Shabbethai and Jozabad, from the leaders of the Levites, who were in charge of the outside work of the house of God; 
NEH.11.17	and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the leader in beginning the thanksgiving at prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his brethren; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. 
NEH.11.18	All the Levites in the holy city 
NEH.11.19	Also the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon and their brethren who kept watch at the gates, 
NEH.11.20	The rest of Israel, of the priests 
NEH.11.21	But the temple servants were living in Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of the temple servants.
NEH.11.22	Now the overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, from the sons of Asaph, who were the singers for the service of the house of God. 
NEH.11.23	For 
NEH.11.24	Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah the son of Judah, was the king’s representative in all matters concerning the people.
NEH.11.25	Now as for the villages with their fields, some of the sons of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba and its 
NEH.11.26	and in Jeshua, in Moladah and Beth-pelet, 
NEH.11.27	and in Hazar-shual, in Beersheba and its towns, 
NEH.11.28	and in Ziklag, in Meconah and in its towns, 
NEH.11.29	and in En-rimmon, in Zorah and in Jarmuth, 
NEH.11.30	Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and its fields, Azekah and its towns. So they encamped from Beersheba as far as the valley of Hinnom. 
NEH.11.31	The sons of Benjamin also 
NEH.11.32	at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 
NEH.11.33	Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 
NEH.11.34	Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 
NEH.11.35	Lod and Ono, the valley of craftsmen. 
NEH.11.36	From the Levites, 
NEH.12.1	Now these are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, 
NEH.12.2	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 
NEH.12.3	Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, 
NEH.12.4	Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, 
NEH.12.5	Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, 
NEH.12.6	Shemaiah and Joiarib, Jedaiah, 
NEH.12.7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah and Jedaiah. These were the heads of the priests and their kinsmen in the days of Jeshua.
NEH.12.8	The Levites 
NEH.12.9	Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brothers, stood opposite them in 
NEH.12.10	Jeshua became the father of Joiakim, and Joiakim became the father of Eliashib, and Eliashib became the father of Joiada, 
NEH.12.11	and Joiada became the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan became the father of Jaddua.
NEH.12.12	Now in the days of Joiakim, the priests, the heads of fathers’ 
NEH.12.13	of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 
NEH.12.14	of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; 
NEH.12.15	of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; 
NEH.12.16	of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; 
NEH.12.17	of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai; 
NEH.12.18	of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 
NEH.12.19	of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; 
NEH.12.20	of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; 
NEH.12.21	of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
NEH.12.22	As for the Levites, the heads of fathers’ 
NEH.12.23	The sons of Levi, the heads of fathers’ 
NEH.12.24	The heads of the Levites 
NEH.12.25	Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon 
NEH.12.26	These 
NEH.12.27	Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites from all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem so that they might celebrate the dedication with gladness, with hymns of thanksgiving and with songs 
NEH.12.28	So the sons of the singers were assembled from the district around Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites, 
NEH.12.29	from Beth-gilgal and from 
NEH.12.30	The priests and the Levites purified themselves; they also purified the people, the gates and the wall.
NEH.12.31	Then I had the leaders of Judah come up on top of the wall, and I appointed two great choirs, the first proceeding to the right on top of the wall toward the Refuse Gate. 
NEH.12.32	Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them, 
NEH.12.33	with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 
NEH.12.35	and some of the sons of the priests with trumpets; 
NEH.12.36	and his kinsmen, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah 
NEH.12.37	At the Fountain Gate they went directly up the steps of the city of David by the stairway of the wall above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.
NEH.12.38	The second choir proceeded to the left, while I followed them with half of the people on the wall, above the Tower of Furnaces, to the Broad Wall, 
NEH.12.39	and above the Gate of Ephraim, by the Old Gate, by the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard. 
NEH.12.40	Then the two choirs took their stand in the house of God. So did I and half of the officials with me; 
NEH.12.41	and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah, with the trumpets; 
NEH.12.42	and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam and Ezer. And the singers sang, with Jezrahiah 
NEH.12.43	and on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy, even the women and children rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar.
NEH.12.44	On that day men were also appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions, the first fruits and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions required by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who served. 
NEH.12.45	For they performed the worship of their God and the service of purification, together with the singers and the gatekeepers in accordance with the command of David 
NEH.12.46	For in the days of David and Asaph, in ancient times, 
NEH.12.47	So all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah gave the portions due the singers and the gatekeepers as each day required, and set apart the consecrated 
NEH.13.1	On that day they read aloud from the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and there was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God, 
NEH.13.2	because they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing. 
NEH.13.3	So when they heard the law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel.
NEH.13.4	Now prior to this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being related to Tobiah, 
NEH.13.5	had prepared a large room for him, where formerly they put the grain offerings, the frankincense, the utensils and the tithes of grain, wine and oil prescribed for the Levites, the singers and the gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests. 
NEH.13.6	But during all this 
NEH.13.7	and I came to Jerusalem and learned about the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, by preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God. 
NEH.13.8	It was very displeasing to me, so I threw all of Tobiah’s household goods out of the room. 
NEH.13.9	Then I gave an order and they cleansed the rooms; and I returned there the utensils of the house of God with the grain offerings and the frankincense.
NEH.13.10	I also discovered that the portions of the Levites had not been given 
NEH.13.11	So I reprimanded the officials and said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” Then I gathered them together and restored them to their posts. 
NEH.13.12	All Judah then brought the tithe of the grain, wine and oil into the storehouses. 
NEH.13.13	In charge of the storehouses I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and in addition to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered reliable, and it was their task to distribute to their kinsmen. 
NEH.13.14	Remember me for this, O my God, and do not blot out my loyal deeds which I have performed for the house of my God and its services.
NEH.13.15	In those days I saw in Judah some who were treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sacks of grain and loading 
NEH.13.16	Also men of Tyre were living there 
NEH.13.17	Then I reprimanded the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this evil thing you are doing, by profaning the sabbath day? 
NEH.13.18	Did not your fathers do the same, so that our God brought on us and on this city all this trouble? Yet you are adding to the wrath on Israel by profaning the sabbath.”
NEH.13.19	It came about that just as it grew dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and that they should not open them until after the sabbath. Then I stationed some of my servants at the gates 
NEH.13.20	Once or twice the traders and merchants of every kind of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem. 
NEH.13.21	Then I warned them and said to them, “Why do you spend the night in front of the wall? If you do so again, I will use force against you.” From that time on they did not come on the sabbath. 
NEH.13.22	And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come as gatekeepers to sanctify the sabbath day. 
NEH.13.23	In those days I also saw that the Jews had married women from Ashdod, Ammon 
NEH.13.24	As for their children, half spoke in the language of Ashdod, and none of them was able to speak the language of Judah, but the language of his own people. 
NEH.13.25	So I contended with them and cursed them and struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, “You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take of their daughters for your sons or for yourselves. 
NEH.13.26	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin regarding these things? Yet among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless the foreign women caused even him to sin. 
NEH.13.27	Do we then hear about you that you have committed all this great evil by acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?” 
NEH.13.28	Even one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, so I drove him away from me. 
NEH.13.29	Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
NEH.13.30	Thus I purified them from everything foreign and appointed duties for the priests and the Levites, each in his task, 
NEH.13.31	and 
EST.1.1	Now it took place in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces, 
EST.1.2	in those days as King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne which 
EST.1.3	in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his princes and attendants, the army 
EST.1.4	And he displayed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor of his great majesty for many days, 180 days.
EST.1.5	When these days were completed, the king gave a banquet lasting seven days for all the people who were present at the citadel in Susa, from the greatest to the least, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace. 
EST.1.6	 fine white and violet linen held by cords of fine purple linen on silver rings and marble columns, 
EST.1.7	Drinks were served in golden vessels of various kinds, and the royal wine was plentiful according to the king’s bounty. 
EST.1.8	The drinking was 
EST.1.9	Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the palace which belonged to King Ahasuerus.
EST.1.10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus, 
EST.1.11	to bring Queen Vashti before the king with 
EST.1.12	But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command delivered by the eunuchs. Then the king became very angry and his wrath burned within him.
EST.1.13	Then the king said to the wise men who understood the times—for it was the custom of the king so 
EST.1.14	and were close to him: Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media who had access to the king’s presence and sat in the first place in the kingdom— 
EST.1.15	“According to law, what is to be done with Queen Vashti, because she did not obey the command of King Ahasuerus 
EST.1.16	In the presence of the king and the princes, Memucan said, “Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king but 
EST.1.17	For the queen’s conduct will become known to all the women causing them to look with contempt on their husbands by saying, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in to his presence, but she did not come.’ 
EST.1.18	This day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s conduct will speak in 
EST.1.19	If it pleases the king, let a royal edict be issued by him and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media so that it cannot be repealed, that Vashti may no longer come into the presence of King Ahasuerus, and let the king give her royal position to another who is more worthy than she. 
EST.1.20	When the king’s edict which he will make is heard throughout all his kingdom, great as it is, then all women will give honor to their husbands, great and small.”
EST.1.22	So he sent letters to all the king’s provinces, to each province according to its script and to every people according to their language, that every man should be the master in his own house and the one who speaks in the language of his own people.
EST.2.1	After these things when the anger of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her. 
EST.2.2	Then the king’s attendants, who served him, said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king. 
EST.2.3	Let the king appoint overseers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather every beautiful young virgin to the citadel of Susa, to the harem, into the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let their cosmetics be given 
EST.2.4	Then let the young lady who pleases the king be queen in place of Vashti.” And the matter pleased the king, and he did accordingly.
EST.2.6	who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the captives who had been exiled with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had exiled. 
EST.2.7	He was bringing up Hadassah, that is Esther, his uncle’s daughter, for she had no father or mother. Now the young lady was beautiful of form and face, and when her father and her mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter.
EST.2.8	So it came about when the command and decree of the king were heard and many young ladies were gathered to the citadel of Susa into the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken to the king’s palace into the custody of Hegai, who was in charge of the women. 
EST.2.9	Now the young lady pleased him and found favor with him. So he quickly provided her with her cosmetics and food, gave her seven choice maids from the king’s palace and transferred her and her maids to the best place in the harem. 
EST.2.10	Esther did not make known her people or her kindred, for Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make 
EST.2.11	Every day Mordecai walked back and forth in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and how she fared.
EST.2.12	Now when the turn of each young lady came to go in to King Ahasuerus, after the end of her twelve months under the regulations for the women—for the days of their beautification were completed as follows: six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and the cosmetics for women— 
EST.2.13	the young lady would go in to the king in this way: anything that she desired was given her to take with her from the harem to the king’s palace. 
EST.2.14	In the evening she would go in and in the morning she would return to the second harem, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not again go in to the king unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.
EST.2.15	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her as his daughter, came to go in to the king, she did not request anything except what Hegai, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the women, advised. And Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her. 
EST.2.16	So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus to his royal palace in the tenth month which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
EST.2.17	The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found favor and kindness with him more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. 
EST.2.18	Then the king gave a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his princes and his servants; he also made a holiday for the provinces and gave gifts according to the king’s bounty.
EST.2.19	When the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate. 
EST.2.20	Esther had not yet made known her kindred or her people, even as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther did what Mordecai told her as she had done when under his care.
EST.2.21	In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s officials from those who guarded the door, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. 
EST.2.22	But the plot became known to Mordecai and he told Queen Esther, and Esther informed the king in Mordecai’s name. 
EST.2.23	Now when the plot was investigated and found 
EST.3.1	After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and established his authority over all the princes who 
EST.3.2	All the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman; for so the king had commanded concerning him. But Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage. 
EST.3.3	Then the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate said to Mordecai, “Why are you transgressing the king’s command?” 
EST.3.4	Now it was when they had spoken daily to him and he would not listen to them, that they told Haman to see whether Mordecai’s reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew. 
EST.3.5	When Haman saw that Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage to him, Haman was filled with rage. 
EST.3.6	But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him 
EST.3.7	In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, Pur, that is the lot, was cast before Haman from day to day and from month 
EST.3.8	Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from 
EST.3.9	If it is pleasing to the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who carry on the 
EST.3.10	Then the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. 
EST.3.11	The king said to Haman, “The silver is yours, and the people 
EST.3.12	Then the king’s scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and it was written just as Haman commanded to the king’s satraps, to the governors who were over each province and to the princes of each people, each province according to its script, each people according to its language, being written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king’s signet ring. 
EST.3.13	Letters were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces to destroy, to kill and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth 
EST.3.14	A copy of the edict to be issued as law in every province was published to all the peoples so that they should be ready for this day. 
EST.3.15	The couriers went out impelled by the king’s command while the decree was issued at the citadel in Susa; and while the king and Haman sat down to drink, the city of Susa was in confusion.
EST.4.1	When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city and wailed loudly and bitterly. 
EST.4.2	He went as far as the king’s gate, for no one was to enter the king’s gate clothed in sackcloth. 
EST.4.3	In each and every province where the command and decree of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing; and many lay on sackcloth and ashes.
EST.4.4	Then Esther’s maidens and her eunuchs came and told her, and the queen writhed in great anguish. And she sent garments to clothe Mordecai that he might remove his sackcloth from him, but he did not accept 
EST.4.5	Then Esther summoned Hathach from the king’s eunuchs, whom the king had appointed to attend her, and ordered him 
EST.4.6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai to the city square in front of the king’s gate. 
EST.4.7	Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews. 
EST.4.8	He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict which had been issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show Esther and inform her, and to order her to go in to the king to implore his favor and to plead with him for her people.
EST.4.9	Hathach came back and related Mordecai’s words to Esther. 
EST.4.10	Then Esther spoke to Hathach and ordered him 
EST.4.11	“All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that for any man or woman who comes to the king to the inner court who is not summoned, he has but one law, that he be put to death, unless the king holds out to him the golden scepter so that he may live. And I have not been summoned to come to the king for these thirty days.” 
EST.4.12	They related Esther’s words to Mordecai.
EST.4.13	Then Mordecai told 
EST.4.14	For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place and you and your father’s house will perish. And who knows whether you have not attained royalty for such a time as this?”
EST.4.15	Then Esther told 
EST.4.16	“Go, assemble all the Jews who are found in Susa, and fast for me; do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maidens also will fast in the same way. And thus I will go in to the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.” 
EST.4.17	So Mordecai went away and did just as Esther had commanded him.
EST.5.1	Now it came about on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king’s palace in front of the king’s rooms, and the king was sitting on his royal throne in the throne room, opposite the entrance to the palace. 
EST.5.2	When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king extended to Esther the golden scepter which 
EST.5.3	Then the king said to her, “What is 
EST.5.4	Esther said, “If it pleases the king, may the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”
EST.5.5	Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly that we may do as Esther desires.” So the king and Haman came to the banquet which Esther had prepared. 
EST.5.6	As they drank their wine at the banquet, the king said to Esther, “What is your petition, for it shall be granted to you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be done.” 
EST.5.7	So Esther replied, “My petition and my request is: 
EST.5.8	if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and do what I request, may the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king says.”
EST.5.9	Then Haman went out that day glad and pleased of heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate and that he did not stand up or tremble before him, Haman was filled with anger against Mordecai. 
EST.5.10	Haman controlled himself, however, went to his house and sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh. 
EST.5.11	Then Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the number of his sons, and every 
EST.5.12	Haman also said, “Even Esther the queen let no one but me come with the king to the banquet which she had prepared; and tomorrow also I am invited by her with the king. 
EST.5.13	Yet all of this does not satisfy me every time I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.” 
EST.5.14	Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, “Have a gallows fifty cubits high made and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it; then go joyfully with the king to the banquet.” And the advice pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made.
EST.6.1	During that night the king could not sleep so he gave an order to bring the book of records, the chronicles, and they were read before the king. 
EST.6.2	It was found written what Mordecai had reported concerning Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who were doorkeepers, that they had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. 
EST.6.3	The king said, “What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?” Then the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.” 
EST.6.4	So the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s palace in order to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows which he had prepared for him. 
EST.6.5	The king’s servants said to him, “Behold, Haman is standing in the court.” And the king said, “Let him come in.” 
EST.6.6	So Haman came in and the king said to him, “What is to be done for the man whom the king desires to honor?” And Haman said to himself, “Whom would the king desire to honor more than me?” 
EST.6.7	Then Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king desires to honor, 
EST.6.8	let them bring a royal robe which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown has been placed; 
EST.6.9	and let the robe and the horse be handed over to one of the king’s most noble princes and let them array the man whom the king desires to honor and lead him on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, ‘Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king desires to honor.’ ”
EST.6.10	Then the king said to Haman, “Take quickly the robes and the horse as you have said, and do so for Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting at the king’s gate; do not fall short in anything of all that you have said.” 
EST.6.11	So Haman took the robe and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and led him 
EST.6.12	Then Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman hurried home, mourning, with 
EST.6.13	Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish origin, you will not overcome him, but will surely fall before him.”
EST.6.14	While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and hastily brought Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.
EST.7.1	Now the king and Haman came to drink 
EST.7.2	And the king said to Esther on the second day also as they drank their wine at the banquet, “What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be done.” 
EST.7.3	Then Queen Esther replied, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request; 
EST.7.4	for we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed and to be annihilated. Now if we had only been sold as slaves, men and women, I would have remained silent, for the trouble would not be commensurate with the annoyance to the king.” 
EST.7.5	Then King Ahasuerus asked Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who would presume to do thus?” 
EST.7.6	Esther said, “A foe and an enemy is this wicked Haman!” Then Haman became terrified before the king and queen.
EST.7.7	The king arose in his anger from drinking wine 
EST.7.8	Now when the king returned from the palace garden into the place where they were drinking wine, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, “Will he even assault the queen with me in the house?” As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face. 
EST.7.9	Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who 
EST.7.10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai, and the king’s anger subsided.
EST.8.1	On that day King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, to Queen Esther; and Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had disclosed what he was to her. 
EST.8.2	The king took off his signet ring which he had taken away from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
EST.8.3	Then Esther spoke again to the king, fell at his feet, wept and implored him to avert the evil 
EST.8.4	The king extended the golden scepter to Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king. 
EST.8.5	Then she said, “If it pleases the king and if I have found favor before him and the matter 
EST.8.6	For how can I endure to see the calamity which will befall my people, and how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?” 
EST.8.7	So King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Behold, I have given the house of Haman to Esther, and him they have hanged on the gallows because he had stretched out his hands against the Jews.
EST.8.8	Now you write to the Jews as you see fit, in the king’s name, and seal 
EST.8.9	So the king’s scribes were called at that time in the third month (that is, the month Sivan), on the twenty-third day; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, the satraps, the governors and the princes of the provinces which 
EST.8.10	He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horses, riding on steeds sired by the royal stud. 
EST.8.11	In them the king granted the Jews who were in each and every city 
EST.8.12	on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, the thirteenth 
EST.8.13	A copy of the edict to be issued as law in each and every province was published to all the peoples, so that the Jews would be ready for this day to avenge themselves on their enemies. 
EST.8.14	The couriers, hastened and impelled by the king’s command, went out, riding on the royal steeds; and the decree was given out at the citadel in Susa.
EST.8.15	Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white, with a large crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced. 
EST.8.16	For the Jews there was light and gladness and joy and honor. 
EST.8.17	In each and every province and in each and every city, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree arrived, there was gladness and joy for the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many among the peoples of the land became Jews, for the dread of the Jews had fallen on them.
EST.9.1	Now in the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar), on the thirteenth day when the king’s command and edict were about to be executed, on the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, it was turned to the contrary so that the Jews themselves gained the mastery over those who hated them. 
EST.9.2	The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm; and no one could stand before them, for the dread of them had fallen on all the peoples. 
EST.9.3	Even all the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and those who were doing the king’s business assisted the Jews, because the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them. 
EST.9.4	Indeed, Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai became greater and greater. 
EST.9.5	Thus the Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying; and they did what they pleased to those who hated them. 
EST.9.6	At the citadel in Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men, 
EST.9.7	and Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
EST.9.8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
EST.9.9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha, 
EST.9.10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
EST.9.11	On that day the number of those who were killed at the citadel in Susa was reported to the king. 
EST.9.12	The king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman at the citadel in Susa. What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall even be granted you. And what is your further request? It shall also be done.” 
EST.9.13	Then said Esther, “If it pleases the king, let tomorrow also be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do according to the edict of today; and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.” 
EST.9.14	So the king commanded that it should be done so; and an edict was issued in Susa, and Haman’s ten sons were hanged. 
EST.9.15	The Jews who were in Susa assembled also on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and killed three hundred men in Susa, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
EST.9.16	Now the rest of the Jews who 
EST.9.17	 on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.
EST.9.18	But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth of the same month, and they rested on the fifteenth day and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing. 
EST.9.19	Therefore the Jews of the rural areas, who live in the rural towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar 
EST.9.20	Then Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, 
EST.9.21	obliging them to celebrate the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same month, annually, 
EST.9.22	because on those days the Jews rid themselves of their enemies, and 
EST.9.23	Thus the Jews undertook what they had started to do, and what Mordecai had written to them. 
EST.9.24	For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the adversary of all the Jews, had schemed against the Jews to destroy them and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to disturb them and destroy them. 
EST.9.25	But when it came to the king’s attention, he commanded by letter that his wicked scheme which he had devised against the Jews, should return on his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. 
EST.9.26	Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. And because of the instructions in this letter, both what they had seen in this regard and what had happened to them, 
EST.9.27	the Jews established and made a custom for themselves and for their descendants and for all those who allied themselves with them, so that they would not fail to celebrate these two days according to their regulation and according to their appointed time annually. 
EST.9.28	So these days were to be remembered and celebrated throughout every generation, every family, every province and every city; and these days of Purim were not to fail from among the Jews, or their memory fade from their descendants.
EST.9.29	Then Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim. 
EST.9.30	He sent letters to all the Jews, to the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, 
EST.9.31	to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established for them, and just as they had established for themselves and for their descendants with instructions for their times of fasting and their lamentations. 
EST.9.32	The command of Esther established these customs for Purim, and it was written in the book.
EST.10.1	Now King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land and on the coastlands of the sea. 
EST.10.2	And all the accomplishments of his authority and strength, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia? 
EST.10.3	For Mordecai the Jew was second 
JOB.1.1	There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil. 
JOB.1.2	Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. 
JOB.1.3	His possessions also were 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and very many servants; and that man was the greatest of all the men of the east. 
JOB.1.4	His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 
JOB.1.5	When the days of feasting had completed their cycle, Job would send and consecrate them, rising up early in the morning and offering burnt offerings 
JOB.1.6	Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the L
JOB.1.7	The L
JOB.1.8	The L
JOB.1.9	Then Satan answered the L
JOB.1.10	Have You not made a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. 
JOB.1.11	But put forth Your hand now and touch all that he has; he will surely curse You to Your face.” 
JOB.1.12	Then the L
JOB.1.13	Now on the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 
JOB.1.14	a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, 
JOB.1.15	and the Sabeans attacked and took them. They also slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
JOB.1.16	While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
JOB.1.17	While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them and slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
JOB.1.18	While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 
JOB.1.19	and behold, a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people and they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.20	Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head, and he fell to the ground and worshiped. 
JOB.1.21	He said,
JOB.1.21	“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,
JOB.1.21	And naked I shall return there.
JOB.1.21	The L
JOB.1.21	Blessed be the name of the L
JOB.1.22	Through all this Job did not sin nor did he blame God.
JOB.2.1	Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the L
JOB.2.2	The L
JOB.2.3	The L
JOB.2.4	Satan answered the L
JOB.2.5	However, put forth Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh; he will curse You to Your face.” 
JOB.2.6	So the L
JOB.2.7	Then Satan went out from the presence of the L
JOB.2.8	And he took a potsherd to scrape himself while he was sitting among the ashes.
JOB.2.9	Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die!” 
JOB.2.10	But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God and not accept adversity?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
JOB.2.11	Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, they came each one from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and comfort him. 
JOB.2.12	When they lifted up their eyes at a distance and did not recognize him, they raised their voices and wept. And each of them tore his robe and they threw dust over their heads toward the sky. 
JOB.2.13	Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights with no one speaking a word to him, for they saw that 
JOB.3.1	Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his 
JOB.3.2	And Job said,
JOB.3.3	“Let the day perish on which I was to be born,
JOB.3.3	And the night 
JOB.3.4	May that day be darkness;
JOB.3.4	Let not God above care for it,
JOB.3.4	Nor light shine on it.
JOB.3.5	Let darkness and black gloom claim it;
JOB.3.5	Let a cloud settle on it;
JOB.3.5	Let the blackness of the day terrify it.
JOB.3.6	Let it not rejoice among the days of the year;
JOB.3.6	Let it not come into the number of the months.
JOB.3.7	Behold, let that night be barren;
JOB.3.7	Let no joyful shout enter it.
JOB.3.8	Let those curse it who curse the day,
JOB.3.8	Who are prepared to rouse Leviathan.
JOB.3.9	Let the stars of its twilight be darkened;
JOB.3.9	Let it wait for light but have none,
JOB.3.9	And let it not see the breaking dawn;
JOB.3.10	Because it did not shut the opening of my 
JOB.3.10	Or hide trouble from my eyes.
JOB.3.11	“Why did I not die at birth,
JOB.3.11	Come forth from the womb and expire?
JOB.3.12	Why did the knees receive me,
JOB.3.12	And why the breasts, that I should suck?
JOB.3.13	For now I would have lain down and been quiet;
JOB.3.13	I would have slept then, I would have been at rest,
JOB.3.14	With kings and 
JOB.3.14	Who rebuilt ruins for themselves;
JOB.3.15	Or with princes who had gold,
JOB.3.15	Who were filling their houses 
JOB.3.16	Or like a miscarriage which is discarded, I would not be,
JOB.3.16	As infants that never saw light.
JOB.3.17	There the wicked cease from raging,
JOB.3.17	And there the weary are at rest.
JOB.3.18	The prisoners are at ease together;
JOB.3.18	They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.
JOB.3.19	The small and the great are there,
JOB.3.19	And the slave is free from his master.
JOB.3.20	“Why is light given to him who suffers,
JOB.3.20	And life to the bitter of soul,
JOB.3.21	Who long for death, but there is none,
JOB.3.21	And dig for it more than for hidden treasures,
JOB.3.22	Who rejoice greatly,
JOB.3.23	And whom God has hedged in?
JOB.3.24	For my groaning comes at the sight of my food,
JOB.3.24	And my cries pour out like water.
JOB.3.25	For what I fear comes upon me,
JOB.3.25	And what I dread befalls me.
JOB.3.26	I am not at ease, nor am I quiet,
JOB.3.26	And I am not at rest, but turmoil comes.”
JOB.4.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
JOB.4.2	“If one ventures a word with you, will you become impatient?
JOB.4.2	But who can refrain from speaking?
JOB.4.3	Behold you have admonished many,
JOB.4.3	And you have strengthened weak hands.
JOB.4.4	Your words have helped the tottering to stand,
JOB.4.4	And you have strengthened feeble knees.
JOB.4.5	But now it has come to you, and you are impatient;
JOB.4.5	It touches you, and you are dismayed.
JOB.4.6	Is not your 
JOB.4.6	And the integrity of your ways your hope?
JOB.4.7	“Remember now, who 
JOB.4.7	Or where were the upright destroyed?
JOB.4.8	According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity
JOB.4.8	And those who sow trouble harvest it.
JOB.4.9	By the breath of God they perish,
JOB.4.9	And by the blast of His anger they come to an end.
JOB.4.10	The roaring of the lion and the voice of the 
JOB.4.10	And the teeth of the young lions are broken.
JOB.4.11	The lion perishes for lack of prey,
JOB.4.11	And the whelps of the lioness are scattered.
JOB.4.12	“Now a word was brought to me stealthily,
JOB.4.12	And my ear received a whisper of it.
JOB.4.13	Amid disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night,
JOB.4.13	When deep sleep falls on men,
JOB.4.14	Dread came upon me, and trembling,
JOB.4.14	And made all my bones shake.
JOB.4.15	Then a 
JOB.4.15	The hair of my flesh bristled up.
JOB.4.16	It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance;
JOB.4.16	A form 
JOB.4.17	‘Can mankind be just before God?
JOB.4.17	Can a man be pure before his Maker?
JOB.4.18	He puts no trust even in His servants;
JOB.4.18	And against His angels He charges error.
JOB.4.19	How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,
JOB.4.19	Whose foundation is in the dust,
JOB.4.19	Who are crushed before the moth!
JOB.4.20	Between morning and evening they are broken in pieces;
JOB.4.20	Unobserved, they perish forever.
JOB.4.21	Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them?
JOB.4.21	They die, yet without wisdom.’
JOB.5.1	“Call now, is there anyone who will answer you?
JOB.5.1	And to which of the holy ones will you turn?
JOB.5.2	For anger slays the foolish man,
JOB.5.2	And jealousy kills the simple.
JOB.5.3	I have seen the foolish taking root,
JOB.5.3	And I cursed his abode immediately.
JOB.5.4	His sons are far from safety,
JOB.5.4	They are even 
JOB.5.4	And there is no deliverer.
JOB.5.5	His harvest the hungry devour
JOB.5.5	And take it to a 
JOB.5.5	And the schemer is eager for their wealth.
JOB.5.6	For affliction does not come from the dust,
JOB.5.6	Nor does trouble sprout from the ground,
JOB.5.7	For man is born for trouble,
JOB.5.7	As sparks fly upward.
JOB.5.8	“But as for me, I would seek God,
JOB.5.8	And I would place my cause before God;
JOB.5.9	Who does great and unsearchable things,
JOB.5.9	Wonders without number.
JOB.5.10	He gives rain on the earth
JOB.5.10	And sends water on the fields,
JOB.5.11	So that He sets on high those who are lowly,
JOB.5.11	And those who mourn are lifted to safety.
JOB.5.12	He frustrates the plotting of the shrewd,
JOB.5.12	So that their hands cannot attain success.
JOB.5.13	He captures the wise by their own shrewdness,
JOB.5.13	And the advice of the cunning is quickly thwarted.
JOB.5.14	By day they meet with darkness,
JOB.5.14	And grope at noon as in the night.
JOB.5.15	But He saves from the sword of their mouth,
JOB.5.15	And the poor from the hand of the mighty.
JOB.5.16	So the helpless has hope,
JOB.5.16	And unrighteousness must shut its mouth.
JOB.5.17	“Behold, how happy is the man whom God reproves,
JOB.5.17	So do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
JOB.5.18	For He inflicts pain, and gives relief;
JOB.5.18	He wounds, and His hands 
JOB.5.19	From six troubles He will deliver you,
JOB.5.19	Even in seven evil will not touch you.
JOB.5.20	In famine He will redeem you from death,
JOB.5.20	And in war from the power of the sword.
JOB.5.21	You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,
JOB.5.21	And you will not be afraid of violence when it comes.
JOB.5.22	You will laugh at violence and famine,
JOB.5.22	And you will not be afraid of wild beasts.
JOB.5.23	For you will be in league with the stones of the field,
JOB.5.23	And the beasts of the field will be at peace with you.
JOB.5.24	You will know that your tent is secure,
JOB.5.24	For you will visit your abode and fear no loss.
JOB.5.25	You will know also that your descendants will be many,
JOB.5.25	And your offspring as the grass of the earth.
JOB.5.26	You will come to the grave in full vigor,
JOB.5.26	Like the stacking of grain in its season.
JOB.5.27	Behold this; we have investigated it, 
JOB.5.27	Hear it, and know for yourself.”
JOB.6.1	Then Job answered,
JOB.6.2	“Oh that my grief were actually weighed
JOB.6.2	And laid in the balances together with my calamity!
JOB.6.3	For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas;
JOB.6.3	Therefore my words have been rash.
JOB.6.4	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,
JOB.6.4	Their poison my spirit drinks;
JOB.6.4	The terrors of God are arrayed against me.
JOB.6.5	Does the wild donkey bray over 
JOB.6.5	Or does the ox low over his fodder?
JOB.6.6	Can something tasteless be eaten without salt,
JOB.6.6	Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
JOB.6.7	My soul refuses to touch 
JOB.6.7	They are like loathsome food to me.
JOB.6.8	“Oh that my request might come to pass,
JOB.6.8	And that God would grant my longing!
JOB.6.9	Would that God were willing to crush me,
JOB.6.9	That He would loose His hand and cut me off!
JOB.6.10	But it is still my consolation,
JOB.6.10	And I rejoice in unsparing pain,
JOB.6.10	That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
JOB.6.11	What is my strength, that I should wait?
JOB.6.11	And what is my end, that I should endure?
JOB.6.12	Is my strength the strength of stones,
JOB.6.12	Or is my flesh bronze?
JOB.6.13	Is it that my help is not within me,
JOB.6.13	And that deliverance is driven from me?
JOB.6.14	“For the despairing man 
JOB.6.14	So that he does not forsake the fear of the Almighty.
JOB.6.15	My brothers have acted deceitfully like a wadi,
JOB.6.15	Like the torrents of wadis which vanish,
JOB.6.16	Which are turbid because of ice
JOB.6.17	When they become waterless, they are silent,
JOB.6.17	When it is hot, they vanish from their place.
JOB.6.18	The paths of their course wind along,
JOB.6.18	They go up into nothing and perish.
JOB.6.19	The caravans of Tema looked,
JOB.6.19	The travelers of Sheba hoped for them.
JOB.6.20	They were disappointed for they had trusted,
JOB.6.20	They came there and were confounded.
JOB.6.21	Indeed, you have now become such,
JOB.6.21	You see a terror and are afraid.
JOB.6.22	Have I said, ‘Give me 
JOB.6.22	Or, ‘Offer a bribe for me from your wealth,’
JOB.6.23	Or, ‘Deliver me from the hand of the adversary,’
JOB.6.23	Or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the tyrants’?
JOB.6.24	“Teach me, and I will be silent;
JOB.6.24	And show me how I have erred.
JOB.6.25	How painful are honest words!
JOB.6.25	But what does your argument prove?
JOB.6.26	Do you intend to reprove 
JOB.6.26	When the words of one in despair belong to the wind?
JOB.6.27	You would even cast 
JOB.6.27	And barter over your friend.
JOB.6.28	Now please look at me,
JOB.6.28	And 
JOB.6.29	Desist now, let there be no injustice;
JOB.6.29	Even desist, my righteousness is yet in it.
JOB.6.30	Is there injustice on my tongue?
JOB.6.30	Cannot my palate discern calamities?
JOB.7.1	“Is not man forced to labor on earth,
JOB.7.1	And 
JOB.7.2	As a slave who pants for the shade,
JOB.7.2	And as a hired man who eagerly waits for his wages,
JOB.7.3	So am I allotted months of vanity,
JOB.7.3	And nights of trouble are appointed me.
JOB.7.4	When I lie down I say,
JOB.7.4	‘When shall I arise?’
JOB.7.4	But the night continues,
JOB.7.4	And I am continually tossing until dawn.
JOB.7.5	My flesh is clothed with worms and a crust of dirt,
JOB.7.5	My skin hardens and runs.
JOB.7.6	My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,
JOB.7.6	And come to an end without hope.
JOB.7.7	“Remember that my life is 
JOB.7.7	My eye will not again see good.
JOB.7.8	The eye of him who sees me will behold me no longer;
JOB.7.8	Your eyes 
JOB.7.9	When a cloud vanishes, it is gone,
JOB.7.9	So he who goes down to Sheol does not come up.
JOB.7.10	He will not return again to his house,
JOB.7.10	Nor will his place know him anymore.
JOB.7.11	“Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;
JOB.7.11	I will speak in the anguish of my spirit,
JOB.7.11	I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.7.12	Am I the sea, or the sea monster,
JOB.7.12	That You set a guard over me?
JOB.7.13	If I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,
JOB.7.13	My couch will ease my complaint,’
JOB.7.14	Then You frighten me with dreams
JOB.7.14	And terrify me by visions;
JOB.7.15	So that my soul would choose suffocation,
JOB.7.15	Death rather than my pains.
JOB.7.16	I waste away; I will not live forever.
JOB.7.16	Leave me alone, for my days are 
JOB.7.17	What is man that You magnify him,
JOB.7.17	And that You are concerned about him,
JOB.7.18	That You examine him every morning
JOB.7.18	And try him every moment?
JOB.7.19	Will You never turn Your gaze away from me,
JOB.7.19	Nor let me alone until I swallow my spittle?
JOB.7.20	Have I sinned? What have I done to You,
JOB.7.20	O watcher of men?
JOB.7.20	Why have You set me as Your target,
JOB.7.20	So that I am a burden to myself?
JOB.7.21	Why then do You not pardon my transgression
JOB.7.21	And take away my iniquity?
JOB.7.21	For now I will lie down in the dust;
JOB.7.21	And You will seek me, but I will not be.”
JOB.8.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
JOB.8.2	“How long will you say these things,
JOB.8.2	And the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?
JOB.8.3	Does God pervert justice?
JOB.8.3	Or does the Almighty pervert what is right?
JOB.8.4	If your sons sinned against Him,
JOB.8.4	Then He delivered them into the power of their transgression.
JOB.8.5	If you would seek God
JOB.8.5	And implore the compassion of the Almighty,
JOB.8.6	If you are pure and upright,
JOB.8.6	Surely now He would rouse Himself for you
JOB.8.6	And restore your righteous estate.
JOB.8.7	Though your beginning was insignificant,
JOB.8.7	Yet your end will increase greatly.
JOB.8.8	“Please inquire of past generations,
JOB.8.8	And consider the things searched out by their fathers.
JOB.8.9	For we are 
JOB.8.9	Because our days on earth are as a shadow.
JOB.8.10	Will they not teach you 
JOB.8.10	And bring forth words from their minds?
JOB.8.11	“Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh?
JOB.8.11	Can the rushes grow without water?
JOB.8.12	While it is still green 
JOB.8.12	Yet it withers before any 
JOB.8.13	So are the paths of all who forget God;
JOB.8.13	And the hope of the godless will perish,
JOB.8.14	Whose confidence is fragile,
JOB.8.14	And whose trust a spider’s web.
JOB.8.15	He trusts in his house, but it does not stand;
JOB.8.15	He holds fast to it, but it does not endure.
JOB.8.16	He thrives before the sun,
JOB.8.16	And his shoots spread out over his garden.
JOB.8.17	His roots wrap around a rock pile,
JOB.8.17	He grasps a house of stones.
JOB.8.18	If he is removed from his place,
JOB.8.18	Then it will deny him, 
JOB.8.19	Behold, this is the joy of His way;
JOB.8.19	And out of the dust others will spring.
JOB.8.20	Lo, God will not reject 
JOB.8.20	Nor will He support the evildoers.
JOB.8.21	He will yet fill your mouth with laughter
JOB.8.21	And your lips with shouting.
JOB.8.22	Those who hate you will be clothed with shame,
JOB.8.22	And the tent of the wicked will be no longer.”
JOB.9.1	Then Job answered,
JOB.9.2	“In truth I know that this is so;
JOB.9.2	But how can a man be in the right before God?
JOB.9.3	If one wished to dispute with Him,
JOB.9.3	He could not answer Him once in a thousand 
JOB.9.4	Wise in heart and mighty in strength,
JOB.9.4	Who has defied Him without harm?
JOB.9.5	When He overturns them in His anger;
JOB.9.6	Who shakes the earth out of its place,
JOB.9.6	And its pillars tremble;
JOB.9.7	Who commands the sun not to shine,
JOB.9.7	And sets a seal upon the stars;
JOB.9.8	Who alone stretches out the heavens
JOB.9.8	And tramples down the waves of the sea;
JOB.9.9	Who makes the Bear, Orion and the Pleiades,
JOB.9.9	And the chambers of the south;
JOB.9.10	Who does great things, unfathomable,
JOB.9.10	And wondrous works without number.
JOB.9.11	Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him;
JOB.9.11	Were He to move past 
JOB.9.12	Were He to snatch away, who could restrain Him?
JOB.9.12	Who could say to Him, ‘What are You doing?’
JOB.9.13	“God will not turn back His anger;
JOB.9.13	Beneath Him crouch the helpers of Rahab.
JOB.9.14	How then can I answer Him,
JOB.9.15	For though I were right, I could not answer;
JOB.9.15	I would have to implore the mercy of my judge.
JOB.9.16	If I called and He answered me,
JOB.9.16	I could not believe that He was listening to my voice.
JOB.9.17	For He bruises me with a tempest
JOB.9.17	And multiplies my wounds without cause.
JOB.9.18	He will not allow me to get my breath,
JOB.9.18	But saturates me with bitterness.
JOB.9.19	If 
JOB.9.19	And if 
JOB.9.20	Though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me;
JOB.9.20	Though I am guiltless, He will declare me guilty.
JOB.9.21	I am guiltless;
JOB.9.21	I do not take notice of myself;
JOB.9.21	I despise my life.
JOB.9.22	It is 
JOB.9.22	‘He destroys the guiltless and the wicked.’
JOB.9.23	If the scourge kills suddenly,
JOB.9.23	He mocks the despair of the innocent.
JOB.9.24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;
JOB.9.24	He covers the faces of its judges.
JOB.9.24	If 
JOB.9.25	“Now my days are swifter than a runner;
JOB.9.25	They flee away, they see no good.
JOB.9.26	They slip by like reed boats,
JOB.9.26	Like an eagle that swoops on its prey.
JOB.9.27	Though I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,
JOB.9.27	I will leave off my 
JOB.9.28	I am afraid of all my pains,
JOB.9.28	I know that You will not acquit me.
JOB.9.29	I am accounted wicked,
JOB.9.29	Why then should I toil in vain?
JOB.9.30	If I should wash myself with snow
JOB.9.30	And cleanse my hands with lye,
JOB.9.31	Yet You would plunge me into the pit,
JOB.9.31	And my own clothes would abhor me.
JOB.9.32	For 
JOB.9.32	That we may go to court together.
JOB.9.33	There is no umpire between us,
JOB.9.33	Who may lay his hand upon us both.
JOB.9.34	Let Him remove His rod from me,
JOB.9.34	And let not dread of Him terrify me.
JOB.9.35	But I am not like that in myself.
JOB.10.1	“I loathe my own life;
JOB.10.1	I will give full vent to my complaint;
JOB.10.1	I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.10.2	I will say to God, ‘Do not condemn me;
JOB.10.2	Let me know why You contend with me.
JOB.10.3	Is it right for You indeed to oppress,
JOB.10.3	To reject the labor of Your hands,
JOB.10.3	And to look favorably on the schemes of the wicked?
JOB.10.4	Have You eyes of flesh?
JOB.10.4	Or do You see as a man sees?
JOB.10.5	Are Your days as the days of a mortal,
JOB.10.5	Or Your years as man’s years,
JOB.10.6	That You should seek for my guilt
JOB.10.6	And search after my sin?
JOB.10.7	According to Your knowledge I am indeed not guilty,
JOB.10.7	Yet there is no deliverance from Your hand.
JOB.10.8	‘Your hands fashioned and made me altogether,
JOB.10.8	And would You destroy me?
JOB.10.9	Remember now, that You have made me as clay;
JOB.10.9	And would You turn me into dust again?
JOB.10.10	Did You not pour me out like milk
JOB.10.10	And curdle me like cheese;
JOB.10.11	Clothe me with skin and flesh,
JOB.10.11	And knit me together with bones and sinews?
JOB.10.12	You have granted me life and lovingkindness;
JOB.10.12	And Your care has preserved my spirit.
JOB.10.13	Yet these things You have concealed in Your heart;
JOB.10.13	I know that this is within You:
JOB.10.14	If I sin, then You would take note of me,
JOB.10.14	And would not acquit me of my guilt.
JOB.10.15	If I am wicked, woe to me!
JOB.10.15	And if I am righteous, I dare not lift up my head.
JOB.10.16	Should 
JOB.10.16	And again You would show Your power against me.
JOB.10.17	You renew Your witnesses against me
JOB.10.17	And increase Your anger toward me;
JOB.10.17	Hardship after hardship is with me.
JOB.10.18	‘Why then have You brought me out of the womb?
JOB.10.18	Would that I had died and no eye had seen me!
JOB.10.19	I should have been as though I had not been,
JOB.10.19	Carried from womb to tomb.’
JOB.10.20	Would He not let my few days alone?
JOB.10.20	Withdraw from me that I may have a little cheer
JOB.10.21	Before I go—and I shall not return—
JOB.10.21	To the land of darkness and deep shadow,
JOB.10.22	The land of utter gloom as darkness 
JOB.10.22	Of deep shadow without order,
JOB.10.22	And which shines as the darkness.”
JOB.11.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,
JOB.11.2	“Shall a multitude of words go unanswered,
JOB.11.2	And a talkative man be acquitted?
JOB.11.3	Shall your boasts silence men?
JOB.11.3	And shall you scoff and none rebuke?
JOB.11.4	For you have said, ‘My teaching is pure,
JOB.11.4	And I am innocent in your eyes.’
JOB.11.5	But would that God might speak,
JOB.11.5	And open His lips against you,
JOB.11.6	And show you the secrets of wisdom!
JOB.11.6	For sound wisdom has two sides.
JOB.11.6	Know then that God forgets a part of your iniquity.
JOB.11.7	“Can you discover the depths of God?
JOB.11.7	Can you discover the limits of the Almighty?
JOB.11.8	Deeper than Sheol, what can you know?
JOB.11.9	Its measure is longer than the earth
JOB.11.9	And broader than the sea.
JOB.11.10	If He passes by or shuts up,
JOB.11.10	Or calls an assembly, who can restrain Him?
JOB.11.11	For He knows false men,
JOB.11.11	And He sees iniquity without investigating.
JOB.11.12	An idiot will become intelligent
JOB.11.12	When the foal of a wild donkey is born a man.
JOB.11.13	“If you would direct your heart right
JOB.11.13	And spread out your hand to Him,
JOB.11.14	If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away,
JOB.11.14	And do not let wickedness dwell in your tents;
JOB.11.15	Then, indeed, you could lift up your face without 
JOB.11.15	And you would be steadfast and not fear.
JOB.11.16	For you would forget 
JOB.11.16	As waters that have passed by, you would remember 
JOB.11.17	Your life would be brighter than noonday;
JOB.11.17	Darkness would be like the morning.
JOB.11.18	Then you would trust, because there is hope;
JOB.11.18	And you would look around and rest securely.
JOB.11.19	You would lie down and none would disturb 
JOB.11.19	And many would entreat your favor.
JOB.11.20	But the eyes of the wicked will fail,
JOB.11.20	And there will be no escape for them;
JOB.11.20	And their hope is to breathe their last.”
JOB.12.1	Then Job responded,
JOB.12.2	“Truly then you are the people,
JOB.12.2	And with you wisdom will die!
JOB.12.3	But I have intelligence as well as you;
JOB.12.3	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.12.3	And who does not know such things as these?
JOB.12.4	I am a joke to my friends,
JOB.12.4	The one who called on God and He answered him;
JOB.12.4	The just 
JOB.12.5	He who is at ease holds calamity in contempt,
JOB.12.5	As prepared for those whose feet slip.
JOB.12.6	The tents of the destroyers prosper,
JOB.12.6	And those who provoke God are secure,
JOB.12.6	Whom God brings into their power.
JOB.12.7	“But now ask the beasts, and let them teach you;
JOB.12.7	And the birds of the heavens, and let them tell you.
JOB.12.8	Or speak to the earth, and let it teach you;
JOB.12.8	And let the fish of the sea declare to you.
JOB.12.9	Who among all these does not know
JOB.12.9	That the hand of the L
JOB.12.10	In whose hand is the life of every living thing,
JOB.12.10	And the breath of all mankind?
JOB.12.11	Does not the ear test words,
JOB.12.11	As the palate tastes its food?
JOB.12.12	Wisdom is with aged men,
JOB.12.13	“With Him are wisdom and might;
JOB.12.13	To Him belong counsel and understanding.
JOB.12.14	Behold, He tears down, and it cannot be rebuilt;
JOB.12.14	He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.
JOB.12.15	Behold, He restrains the waters, and they dry up;
JOB.12.15	And He sends them out, and they inundate the earth.
JOB.12.16	With Him are strength and sound wisdom,
JOB.12.16	The misled and the misleader belong to Him.
JOB.12.17	He makes counselors walk barefoot
JOB.12.17	And makes fools of judges.
JOB.12.18	He loosens the bond of kings
JOB.12.18	And binds their loins with a girdle.
JOB.12.19	He makes priests walk barefoot
JOB.12.19	And overthrows the secure ones.
JOB.12.20	He deprives the trusted ones of speech
JOB.12.20	And takes away the discernment of the elders.
JOB.12.21	He pours contempt on nobles
JOB.12.21	And loosens the belt of the strong.
JOB.12.22	He reveals mysteries from the darkness
JOB.12.22	And brings the deep darkness into light.
JOB.12.23	He makes the nations great, then destroys them;
JOB.12.23	He enlarges the nations, then leads them away.
JOB.12.24	He deprives of intelligence the chiefs of the earth’s people
JOB.12.24	And makes them wander in a pathless waste.
JOB.12.25	They grope in darkness with no light,
JOB.12.25	And He makes them stagger like a drunken man.
JOB.13.1	“Behold, my eye has seen all 
JOB.13.1	My ear has heard and understood it.
JOB.13.2	What you know I also know;
JOB.13.2	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.13.3	“But I would speak to the Almighty,
JOB.13.3	And I desire to argue with God.
JOB.13.4	But you smear with lies;
JOB.13.4	You are all worthless physicians.
JOB.13.5	O that you would be completely silent,
JOB.13.5	And that it would become your wisdom!
JOB.13.6	Please hear my argument
JOB.13.6	And listen to the contentions of my lips.
JOB.13.7	Will you speak what is unjust for God,
JOB.13.7	And speak what is deceitful for Him?
JOB.13.8	Will you show partiality for Him?
JOB.13.8	Will you contend for God?
JOB.13.9	Will it be well when He examines you?
JOB.13.9	Or will you deceive Him as one deceives a man?
JOB.13.10	He will surely reprove you
JOB.13.10	If you secretly show partiality.
JOB.13.11	Will not His majesty terrify you,
JOB.13.11	And the dread of Him fall on you?
JOB.13.12	Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes,
JOB.13.12	Your defenses are defenses of clay.
JOB.13.13	“Be silent before me so that I may speak;
JOB.13.13	Then let come on me what may.
JOB.13.14	Why should I take my flesh in my teeth
JOB.13.14	And put my life in my hands?
JOB.13.15	Though He slay me,
JOB.13.15	I will hope in Him.
JOB.13.15	Nevertheless I will argue my ways before Him.
JOB.13.16	This also will be my salvation,
JOB.13.16	For a godless man may not come before His presence.
JOB.13.17	Listen carefully to my speech,
JOB.13.17	And let my declaration 
JOB.13.18	Behold now, I have prepared my case;
JOB.13.18	I know that I will be vindicated.
JOB.13.19	Who will contend with me?
JOB.13.19	For then I would be silent and die.
JOB.13.20	“Only two things do not do to me,
JOB.13.20	Then I will not hide from Your face:
JOB.13.21	Remove Your hand from me,
JOB.13.21	And let not the dread of You terrify me.
JOB.13.22	Then call, and I will answer;
JOB.13.22	Or let me speak, then reply to me.
JOB.13.23	How many are my iniquities and sins?
JOB.13.23	Make known to me my rebellion and my sin.
JOB.13.24	Why do You hide Your face
JOB.13.24	And consider me Your enemy?
JOB.13.25	Will You cause a driven leaf to tremble?
JOB.13.25	Or will You pursue the dry chaff?
JOB.13.26	For You write bitter things against me
JOB.13.26	And make me to inherit the iniquities of my youth.
JOB.13.27	You put my feet in the stocks
JOB.13.27	And watch all my paths;
JOB.13.27	You set a limit for the soles of my feet,
JOB.13.28	While I am decaying like a rotten thing,
JOB.13.28	Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
JOB.14.1	“Man, who is born of woman,
JOB.14.1	Is short-lived and full of turmoil.
JOB.14.2	Like a flower he comes forth and withers.
JOB.14.2	He also flees like a shadow and does not remain.
JOB.14.3	You also open Your eyes on him
JOB.14.3	And bring him into judgment with Yourself.
JOB.14.4	Who can make the clean out of the unclean?
JOB.14.4	No one!
JOB.14.5	Since his days are determined,
JOB.14.5	The number of his months is with You;
JOB.14.5	And his limits You have set so that he cannot pass.
JOB.14.6	Turn Your gaze from him that he may rest,
JOB.14.6	Until he fulfills his day like a hired man.
JOB.14.7	“For there is hope for a tree,
JOB.14.7	When it is cut down, that it will sprout again,
JOB.14.7	And its shoots will not fail.
JOB.14.8	Though its roots grow old in the ground
JOB.14.8	And its stump dies in the dry soil,
JOB.14.9	At the scent of water it will flourish
JOB.14.9	And put forth sprigs like a plant.
JOB.14.10	But man dies and lies prostrate.
JOB.14.10	Man expires, and where is he?
JOB.14.11	And a river becomes parched and dried up,
JOB.14.12	So man lies down and does not rise.
JOB.14.12	Until the heavens are no longer,
JOB.14.12	He will not awake nor be aroused out of his sleep.
JOB.14.13	“Oh that You would hide me in Sheol,
JOB.14.13	That You would conceal me until Your wrath returns 
JOB.14.13	That You would set a limit for me and remember me!
JOB.14.14	If a man dies, will he live 
JOB.14.14	All the days of my struggle I will wait
JOB.14.14	Until my change comes.
JOB.14.15	You will call, and I will answer You;
JOB.14.15	You will long for the work of Your hands.
JOB.14.16	For now You number my steps,
JOB.14.16	You do not observe my sin.
JOB.14.17	My transgression is sealed up in a bag,
JOB.14.17	And You wrap up my iniquity.
JOB.14.18	“But the falling mountain crumbles away,
JOB.14.18	And the rock moves from its place;
JOB.14.19	Water wears away stones,
JOB.14.19	Its torrents wash away the dust of the earth;
JOB.14.19	So You destroy man’s hope.
JOB.14.20	You forever overpower him and he departs;
JOB.14.21	His sons achieve honor, but he does not know 
JOB.14.21	Or they become insignificant, but he does not perceive it.
JOB.14.22	But his body pains him,
JOB.14.22	And he mourns only for himself.”
JOB.15.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded,
JOB.15.2	“Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge
JOB.15.2	And fill himself with the east wind?
JOB.15.3	Should he argue with useless talk,
JOB.15.3	Or with words which are not profitable?
JOB.15.4	Indeed, you do away with reverence
JOB.15.4	And hinder meditation before God.
JOB.15.5	For your guilt teaches your mouth,
JOB.15.5	And you choose the language of the crafty.
JOB.15.6	Your own mouth condemns you, and not I;
JOB.15.6	And your own lips testify against you.
JOB.15.7	“Were you the first man to be born,
JOB.15.7	Or were you brought forth before the hills?
JOB.15.8	Do you hear the secret counsel of God,
JOB.15.8	And limit wisdom to yourself?
JOB.15.9	What do you know that we do not know?
JOB.15.10	Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us,
JOB.15.10	Older than your father.
JOB.15.11	Are the consolations of God too small for you,
JOB.15.11	Even the word 
JOB.15.12	Why does your heart carry you away?
JOB.15.12	And why do your eyes flash,
JOB.15.13	That you should turn your spirit against God
JOB.15.13	And allow 
JOB.15.14	What is man, that he should be pure,
JOB.15.14	Or he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
JOB.15.15	Behold, He puts no trust in His holy ones,
JOB.15.15	And the heavens are not pure in His sight;
JOB.15.16	How much less one who is detestable and corrupt,
JOB.15.16	Man, who drinks iniquity like water!
JOB.15.17	“I will tell you, listen to me;
JOB.15.17	And what I have seen I will also declare;
JOB.15.18	What wise men have told,
JOB.15.18	And have not concealed from their fathers,
JOB.15.19	To whom alone the land was given,
JOB.15.19	And no alien passed among them.
JOB.15.20	The wicked man writhes in pain all 
JOB.15.20	And numbered are the years stored up for the ruthless.
JOB.15.21	Sounds of terror are in his ears;
JOB.15.21	While at peace the destroyer comes upon him.
JOB.15.22	He does not believe that he will return from darkness,
JOB.15.22	And he is destined for the sword.
JOB.15.23	He wanders about for food, saying, ‘Where is it?’
JOB.15.23	He knows that a day of darkness is at hand.
JOB.15.24	Distress and anguish terrify him,
JOB.15.24	They overpower him like a king ready for the attack,
JOB.15.25	Because he has stretched out his hand against God
JOB.15.25	And conducts himself arrogantly against the Almighty.
JOB.15.26	He rushes headlong at Him
JOB.15.26	With his massive shield.
JOB.15.27	For he has covered his face with his fat
JOB.15.27	And made his thighs heavy with flesh.
JOB.15.28	He has lived in desolate cities,
JOB.15.28	In houses no one would inhabit,
JOB.15.28	Which are destined to become ruins.
JOB.15.29	He will not become rich, nor will his wealth endure;
JOB.15.29	And his grain will not bend down to the ground.
JOB.15.30	He will not escape from darkness;
JOB.15.30	The flame will wither his shoots,
JOB.15.30	And by the breath of His mouth he will go away.
JOB.15.31	Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself;
JOB.15.31	For emptiness will be his reward.
JOB.15.32	It will be accomplished before his time,
JOB.15.32	And his palm branch will not be green.
JOB.15.33	He will drop off his unripe grape like the vine,
JOB.15.33	And will cast off his flower like the olive tree.
JOB.15.34	For the company of the godless is barren,
JOB.15.34	And fire consumes the tents of the corrupt.
JOB.15.35	They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity,
JOB.15.35	And their mind prepares deception.”
JOB.16.1	Then Job answered,
JOB.16.2	“I have heard many such things;
JOB.16.2	Sorry comforters are you all.
JOB.16.3	Is there 
JOB.16.3	Or what plagues you that you answer?
JOB.16.4	I too could speak like you,
JOB.16.4	If I were in your place.
JOB.16.4	I could compose words against you
JOB.16.4	And shake my head at you.
JOB.16.5	I could strengthen you with my mouth,
JOB.16.5	And the solace of my lips could lessen 
JOB.16.6	“If I speak, my pain is not lessened,
JOB.16.6	And if I hold back, what has left me?
JOB.16.7	But now He has exhausted me;
JOB.16.7	You have laid waste all my company.
JOB.16.8	You have shriveled me up,
JOB.16.8	It has become a witness;
JOB.16.8	And my leanness rises up against me,
JOB.16.8	It testifies to my face.
JOB.16.9	His anger has torn me and hunted me down,
JOB.16.9	He has gnashed at me with His teeth;
JOB.16.9	My adversary glares at me.
JOB.16.10	They have gaped at me with their mouth,
JOB.16.10	They have slapped me on the cheek with contempt;
JOB.16.10	They have massed themselves against me.
JOB.16.11	God hands me over to ruffians
JOB.16.11	And tosses me into the hands of the wicked.
JOB.16.12	I was at ease, but He shattered me,
JOB.16.12	And He has grasped me by the neck and shaken me to pieces;
JOB.16.12	He has also set me up as His target.
JOB.16.13	His arrows surround me.
JOB.16.13	Without mercy He splits my kidneys open;
JOB.16.13	He pours out my gall on the ground.
JOB.16.14	He breaks through me with breach after breach;
JOB.16.14	He runs at me like a warrior.
JOB.16.15	I have sewed sackcloth over my skin
JOB.16.15	And thrust my horn in the dust.
JOB.16.16	My face is flushed from weeping,
JOB.16.16	And deep darkness is on my eyelids,
JOB.16.17	Although there is no violence in my hands,
JOB.16.17	And my prayer is pure.
JOB.16.18	“O earth, do not cover my blood,
JOB.16.18	And let there be no 
JOB.16.19	Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven,
JOB.16.19	And my advocate is on high.
JOB.16.20	My friends are my scoffers;
JOB.16.20	My eye weeps to God.
JOB.16.21	O that a man might plead with God
JOB.16.21	As a man with his neighbor!
JOB.16.22	For when a few years are past,
JOB.16.22	I shall go the way of no return.
JOB.17.1	“My spirit is broken, my days are extinguished,
JOB.17.1	The grave is 
JOB.17.2	Surely mockers are with me,
JOB.17.2	And my eye gazes on their provocation.
JOB.17.3	“Lay down, now, a pledge for me with Yourself;
JOB.17.3	Who is there that will be my guarantor?
JOB.17.4	For You have kept their heart from understanding,
JOB.17.4	Therefore You will not exalt 
JOB.17.5	He who informs against friends for a share 
JOB.17.5	The eyes of his children also will languish.
JOB.17.6	“But He has made me a byword of the people,
JOB.17.6	And I am one at whom men spit.
JOB.17.7	My eye has also grown dim because of grief,
JOB.17.7	And all my members are as a shadow.
JOB.17.8	The upright will be appalled at this,
JOB.17.8	And the innocent will stir up himself against the godless.
JOB.17.9	Nevertheless the righteous will hold to his way,
JOB.17.9	And he who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger.
JOB.17.10	But come again all of you now,
JOB.17.10	For I do not find a wise man among you.
JOB.17.11	My days are past, my plans are torn apart,
JOB.17.12	They make night into day, 
JOB.17.12	‘The light is near,’ in the presence of darkness.
JOB.17.13	If I look for Sheol as my home,
JOB.17.13	I make my bed in the darkness;
JOB.17.14	If I call to the pit, ‘You are my father’;
JOB.17.14	To the worm, ‘my mother and my sister’;
JOB.17.15	Where now is my hope?
JOB.17.15	And who regards my hope?
JOB.17.16	Will it go down with me to Sheol?
JOB.17.16	Shall we together go down into the dust?”
JOB.18.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite responded,
JOB.18.2	“How long will you hunt for words?
JOB.18.2	Show understanding and then we can talk.
JOB.18.3	Why are we regarded as beasts,
JOB.18.3	As stupid in your eyes?
JOB.18.4	O you who tear yourself in your anger—
JOB.18.4	For your sake is the earth to be abandoned,
JOB.18.4	Or the rock to be moved from its place?
JOB.18.5	“Indeed, the light of the wicked goes out,
JOB.18.5	And the flame of his fire gives no light.
JOB.18.6	The light in his tent is darkened,
JOB.18.6	And his lamp goes out above him.
JOB.18.7	His vigorous stride is shortened,
JOB.18.7	And his own scheme brings him down.
JOB.18.8	For he is thrown into the net by his own feet,
JOB.18.8	And he steps on the webbing.
JOB.18.9	A snare seizes 
JOB.18.10	A noose for him is hidden in the ground,
JOB.18.10	And a trap for him on the path.
JOB.18.11	All around terrors frighten him,
JOB.18.11	And harry him at every step.
JOB.18.12	His strength is famished,
JOB.18.12	And calamity is ready at his side.
JOB.18.13	His skin is devoured by disease,
JOB.18.13	The firstborn of death devours his limbs.
JOB.18.14	He is torn from the security of his tent,
JOB.18.14	And they march him before the king of terrors.
JOB.18.15	There dwells in his tent nothing of his;
JOB.18.15	Brimstone is scattered on his habitation.
JOB.18.16	His roots are dried below,
JOB.18.16	And his branch is cut off above.
JOB.18.17	Memory of him perishes from the earth,
JOB.18.17	And he has no name abroad.
JOB.18.18	He is driven from light into darkness,
JOB.18.18	And chased from the inhabited world.
JOB.18.19	He has no offspring or posterity among his people,
JOB.18.19	Nor any survivor where he sojourned.
JOB.18.20	Those in the west are appalled at his fate,
JOB.18.20	And those in the east are seized with horror.
JOB.18.21	Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked,
JOB.18.21	And this is the place of him who does not know God.”
JOB.19.1	Then Job responded,
JOB.19.2	“How long will you torment me
JOB.19.2	And crush me with words?
JOB.19.3	These ten times you have insulted me;
JOB.19.3	You are not ashamed to wrong me.
JOB.19.4	Even if I have truly erred,
JOB.19.4	My error lodges with me.
JOB.19.5	If indeed you vaunt yourselves against me
JOB.19.5	And prove my disgrace to me,
JOB.19.6	Know then that God has wronged me
JOB.19.6	And has closed His net around me.
JOB.19.7	“Behold, I cry, ‘Violence!’ but I get no answer;
JOB.19.7	I shout for help, but there is no justice.
JOB.19.8	He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass,
JOB.19.8	And He has put darkness on my paths.
JOB.19.9	He has stripped my honor from me
JOB.19.9	And removed the crown from my head.
JOB.19.10	He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone;
JOB.19.10	And He has uprooted my hope like a tree.
JOB.19.11	He has also kindled His anger against me
JOB.19.11	And considered me as His enemy.
JOB.19.12	His troops come together,
JOB.19.12	And build up their way against me
JOB.19.12	And camp around my tent.
JOB.19.13	“He has removed my brothers far from me,
JOB.19.13	And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.
JOB.19.14	My relatives have failed,
JOB.19.14	And my intimate friends have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	Those who live in my house and my maids consider me a stranger.
JOB.19.15	I am a foreigner in their sight.
JOB.19.16	I call to my servant, but he does not answer;
JOB.19.16	I have to implore him with my mouth.
JOB.19.17	My breath is offensive to my wife,
JOB.19.17	And I am loathsome to my own brothers.
JOB.19.18	Even young children despise me;
JOB.19.18	I rise up and they speak against me.
JOB.19.19	All my associates abhor me,
JOB.19.19	And those I love have turned against me.
JOB.19.20	My bone clings to my skin and my flesh,
JOB.19.20	And I have escaped 
JOB.19.21	Pity me, pity me, O you my friends,
JOB.19.21	For the hand of God has struck me.
JOB.19.22	Why do you persecute me as God 
JOB.19.22	And are not satisfied with my flesh?
JOB.19.23	“Oh that my words were written!
JOB.19.23	Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
JOB.19.24	That with an iron stylus and lead
JOB.19.24	They were engraved in the rock forever!
JOB.19.25	As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives,
JOB.19.25	And at the last He will take His stand on the earth.
JOB.19.26	Even after my skin is destroyed,
JOB.19.26	Yet from my flesh I shall see God;
JOB.19.27	Whom I myself shall behold,
JOB.19.27	And whom my eyes will see and not another.
JOB.19.27	My heart faints within me!
JOB.19.28	If you say, ‘How shall we persecute him?’
JOB.19.28	And ‘What pretext for a case against him can we find?’
JOB.19.29	For wrath 
JOB.19.29	So that you may know there is judgment.”
JOB.20.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,
JOB.20.2	“Therefore my disquieting thoughts make me respond,
JOB.20.2	Even because of my inward agitation.
JOB.20.3	I listened to the reproof which insults me,
JOB.20.3	And the spirit of my understanding makes me answer.
JOB.20.4	Do you know this from of old,
JOB.20.4	From the establishment of man on earth,
JOB.20.5	That the triumphing of the wicked is short,
JOB.20.5	And the joy of the godless momentary?
JOB.20.6	Though his loftiness reaches the heavens,
JOB.20.6	And his head touches the clouds,
JOB.20.7	He perishes forever like his refuse;
JOB.20.7	Those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’
JOB.20.8	He flies away like a dream, and they cannot find him;
JOB.20.8	Even like a vision of the night he is chased away.
JOB.20.9	The eye which saw him sees him no longer,
JOB.20.9	And his place no longer beholds him.
JOB.20.10	His sons favor the poor,
JOB.20.10	And his hands give back his wealth.
JOB.20.11	His bones are full of his youthful vigor,
JOB.20.11	But it lies down with him in the dust.
JOB.20.12	“Though evil is sweet in his mouth
JOB.20.13	But holds it in his mouth,
JOB.20.14	To the venom of cobras within him.
JOB.20.15	He swallows riches,
JOB.20.15	But will vomit them up;
JOB.20.15	God will expel them from his belly.
JOB.20.16	He sucks the poison of cobras;
JOB.20.16	The viper’s tongue slays him.
JOB.20.17	He does not look at the streams,
JOB.20.17	The rivers flowing with honey and curds.
JOB.20.18	He returns what he has attained
JOB.20.18	And cannot swallow 
JOB.20.18	As to the riches of his trading,
JOB.20.18	He cannot even enjoy 
JOB.20.19	For he has oppressed 
JOB.20.19	He has seized a house which he has not built.
JOB.20.20	“Because he knew no quiet within him,
JOB.20.20	He does not retain anything he desires.
JOB.20.21	Nothing remains for him to devour,
JOB.20.21	Therefore his prosperity does not endure.
JOB.20.22	In the fullness of his plenty he will be cramped;
JOB.20.22	The hand of everyone who suffers will come 
JOB.20.23	When he fills his belly,
JOB.20.23	And will rain 
JOB.20.24	He may flee from the iron weapon,
JOB.20.25	It is drawn forth and comes out of his back,
JOB.20.25	Even the glittering point from his gall.
JOB.20.25	Terrors come upon him,
JOB.20.26	Complete darkness is held in reserve for his treasures,
JOB.20.26	And unfanned fire will devour him;
JOB.20.26	It will consume the survivor in his tent.
JOB.20.27	The heavens will reveal his iniquity,
JOB.20.27	And the earth will rise up against him.
JOB.20.28	The increase of his house will depart;
JOB.20.29	This is the wicked man’s portion from God,
JOB.20.29	Even the heritage decreed to him by God.”
JOB.21.1	Then Job answered,
JOB.21.2	“Listen carefully to my speech,
JOB.21.2	And let this be your 
JOB.21.3	Bear with me that I may speak;
JOB.21.3	Then after I have spoken, you may mock.
JOB.21.4	As for me, is my complaint to man?
JOB.21.4	And why should I not be impatient?
JOB.21.5	Look at me, and be astonished,
JOB.21.5	And put 
JOB.21.6	Even when I remember, I am disturbed,
JOB.21.6	And horror takes hold of my flesh.
JOB.21.7	Why do the wicked 
JOB.21.7	Continue on, also become very powerful?
JOB.21.8	Their descendants are established with them in their sight,
JOB.21.8	And their offspring before their eyes,
JOB.21.9	Their houses are safe from fear,
JOB.21.9	And the rod of God is not on them.
JOB.21.10	His ox mates without fail;
JOB.21.10	His cow calves and does not abort.
JOB.21.11	They send forth their little ones like the flock,
JOB.21.11	And their children skip about.
JOB.21.12	They sing to the timbrel and harp
JOB.21.12	And rejoice at the sound of the flute.
JOB.21.13	They spend their days in prosperity,
JOB.21.13	And suddenly they go down to Sheol.
JOB.21.14	They say to God, ‘Depart from us!
JOB.21.14	We do not even desire the knowledge of Your ways.
JOB.21.15	Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him,
JOB.21.15	And what would we gain if we entreat Him?’
JOB.21.16	Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand;
JOB.21.16	The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.21.17	“How often is the lamp of the wicked put out,
JOB.21.17	Or does their calamity fall on them?
JOB.21.17	Does God apportion destruction in His anger?
JOB.21.18	Are they as straw before the wind,
JOB.21.18	And like chaff which the storm carries away?
JOB.21.19	Let God repay him so that he may know 
JOB.21.20	Let his own eyes see his decay,
JOB.21.20	And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
JOB.21.21	For what does he care for his household 
JOB.21.21	When the number of his months is cut off?
JOB.21.22	Can anyone teach God knowledge,
JOB.21.22	In that He judges those on high?
JOB.21.23	One dies in his full strength,
JOB.21.23	Being wholly at ease and satisfied;
JOB.21.24	His sides are filled out with fat,
JOB.21.24	And the marrow of his bones is moist,
JOB.21.25	While another dies with a bitter soul,
JOB.21.25	Never even tasting 
JOB.21.26	Together they lie down in the dust,
JOB.21.26	And worms cover them.
JOB.21.27	“Behold, I know your thoughts,
JOB.21.27	And the plans by which you would wrong me.
JOB.21.28	For you say, ‘Where is the house of the nobleman,
JOB.21.28	And where is the tent, the dwelling places of the wicked?’
JOB.21.29	Have you not asked wayfaring men,
JOB.21.29	And do you not recognize their witness?
JOB.21.30	For the wicked is reserved for the day of calamity;
JOB.21.30	They will be led forth at the day of fury.
JOB.21.31	Who will confront him with his actions,
JOB.21.31	And who will repay him for what he has done?
JOB.21.32	While he is carried to the grave,
JOB.21.33	The clods of the valley will gently cover him;
JOB.21.33	Moreover, all men will follow after him,
JOB.21.33	While countless ones 
JOB.21.34	How then will you vainly comfort me,
JOB.21.34	For your answers remain 
JOB.22.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded,
JOB.22.2	“Can a vigorous man be of use to God,
JOB.22.2	Or a wise man be useful to himself?
JOB.22.3	Is there any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous,
JOB.22.3	Or profit if you make your ways perfect?
JOB.22.4	Is it because of your reverence that He reproves you,
JOB.22.4	That He enters into judgment against you?
JOB.22.5	Is not your wickedness great,
JOB.22.5	And your iniquities without end?
JOB.22.6	For you have taken pledges of your brothers without cause,
JOB.22.6	And stripped men naked.
JOB.22.7	To the weary you have given no water to drink,
JOB.22.7	And from the hungry you have withheld bread.
JOB.22.8	But the earth belongs to the mighty man,
JOB.22.8	And the honorable man dwells in it.
JOB.22.9	You have sent widows away empty,
JOB.22.9	And the strength of the orphans has been crushed.
JOB.22.10	Therefore snares surround you,
JOB.22.10	And sudden dread terrifies you,
JOB.22.11	Or darkness, so that you cannot see,
JOB.22.11	And an abundance of water covers you.
JOB.22.12	“Is not God 
JOB.22.12	Look also at the distant stars, how high they are!
JOB.22.13	You say, ‘What does God know?
JOB.22.13	Can He judge through the thick darkness?
JOB.22.14	Clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see;
JOB.22.14	And He walks on the vault of heaven.’
JOB.22.15	Will you keep to the ancient path
JOB.22.15	Which wicked men have trod,
JOB.22.16	Who were snatched away before their time,
JOB.22.16	Whose foundations were washed away by a river?
JOB.22.17	They said to God, ‘Depart from us!’
JOB.22.17	And ‘What can the Almighty do to them?’
JOB.22.18	Yet He filled their houses with good 
JOB.22.18	But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.22.19	The righteous see and are glad,
JOB.22.19	And the innocent mock them,
JOB.22.20	And their abundance the fire has consumed.’
JOB.22.21	“Yield now and be at peace with Him;
JOB.22.21	Thereby good will come to you.
JOB.22.22	Please receive instruction from His mouth
JOB.22.22	And establish His words in your heart.
JOB.22.23	If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored;
JOB.22.23	If you remove unrighteousness far from your tent,
JOB.22.24	And place 
JOB.22.24	And 
JOB.22.25	Then the Almighty will be your gold
JOB.22.25	And choice silver to you.
JOB.22.26	For then you will delight in the Almighty
JOB.22.26	And lift up your face to God.
JOB.22.27	You will pray to Him, and He will hear you;
JOB.22.27	And you will pay your vows.
JOB.22.28	You will also decree a thing, and it will be established for you;
JOB.22.28	And light will shine on your ways.
JOB.22.29	When you are cast down, you will speak with confidence,
JOB.22.29	And the humble person He will save.
JOB.22.30	He will deliver one who is not innocent,
JOB.22.30	And he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”
JOB.23.1	Then Job replied,
JOB.23.2	“Even today my complaint is rebellion;
JOB.23.2	His hand is heavy despite my groaning.
JOB.23.3	Oh that I knew where I might find Him,
JOB.23.3	That I might come to His seat!
JOB.23.4	I would present 
JOB.23.4	And fill my mouth with arguments.
JOB.23.5	I would learn the words 
JOB.23.5	And perceive what He would say to me.
JOB.23.6	Would He contend with me by the greatness of 
JOB.23.6	No, surely He would pay attention to me.
JOB.23.7	There the upright would reason with Him;
JOB.23.7	And I would be delivered forever from my Judge.
JOB.23.8	“Behold, I go forward but He is not 
JOB.23.8	And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;
JOB.23.9	When He acts on the left, I cannot behold 
JOB.23.9	He turns on the right, I cannot see Him.
JOB.23.10	But He knows the way I take;
JOB.23.11	My foot has held fast to His path;
JOB.23.11	I have kept His way and not turned aside.
JOB.23.12	I have not departed from the command of His lips;
JOB.23.12	I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.
JOB.23.13	But He is unique and who can turn Him?
JOB.23.13	And 
JOB.23.14	For He performs what is appointed for me,
JOB.23.14	And many such 
JOB.23.15	Therefore, I would be dismayed at His presence;
JOB.23.16	And the Almighty 
JOB.23.17	But I am not silenced by the darkness,
JOB.23.17	Nor deep gloom 
JOB.24.1	“Why are times not stored up by the Almighty,
JOB.24.1	And why do those who know Him not see His days?
JOB.24.2	Some remove the landmarks;
JOB.24.2	They seize and devour flocks.
JOB.24.3	They drive away the donkeys of the orphans;
JOB.24.3	They take the widow’s ox for a pledge.
JOB.24.4	They push the needy aside from the road;
JOB.24.4	The poor of the land are made to hide themselves altogether.
JOB.24.5	Behold, as wild donkeys in the wilderness
JOB.24.5	They go forth seeking food in their activity,
JOB.24.5	As bread for 
JOB.24.6	They harvest their fodder in the field
JOB.24.6	And glean the vineyard of the wicked.
JOB.24.7	They spend the night naked, without clothing,
JOB.24.7	And have no covering against the cold.
JOB.24.8	They are wet with the mountain rains
JOB.24.8	And hug the rock for want of a shelter.
JOB.24.9	Others snatch the orphan from the breast,
JOB.24.9	And against the poor they take a pledge.
JOB.24.10	They cause 
JOB.24.10	And they take away the sheaves from the hungry.
JOB.24.11	Within the walls they produce oil;
JOB.24.11	They tread wine presses but thirst.
JOB.24.12	From the city men groan,
JOB.24.12	And the souls of the wounded cry out;
JOB.24.12	Yet God does not pay attention to folly.
JOB.24.13	“Others have been with those who rebel against the light;
JOB.24.13	They do not want to know its ways
JOB.24.13	Nor abide in its paths.
JOB.24.14	The murderer arises at dawn;
JOB.24.14	He kills the poor and the needy,
JOB.24.14	And at night he is as a thief.
JOB.24.15	The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight,
JOB.24.15	Saying, ‘No eye will see me.’
JOB.24.15	And he disguises his face.
JOB.24.16	In the dark they dig into houses,
JOB.24.16	They shut themselves up by day;
JOB.24.16	They do not know the light.
JOB.24.17	For the morning is the same to him as thick darkness,
JOB.24.17	For he is familiar with the terrors of thick darkness.
JOB.24.18	“They are insignificant on the surface of the water;
JOB.24.18	Their portion is cursed on the earth.
JOB.24.18	They do not turn toward the vineyards.
JOB.24.19	Drought and heat consume the snow waters,
JOB.24.20	A mother will forget him;
JOB.24.20	The worm feeds sweetly till he is no longer remembered.
JOB.24.20	And wickedness will be broken like a tree.
JOB.24.21	He wrongs the barren woman
JOB.24.21	And does no good for the widow.
JOB.24.22	But He drags off the valiant by His power;
JOB.24.22	He rises, but no one has assurance of life.
JOB.24.23	He provides them with security, and they are supported;
JOB.24.23	And His eyes are on their ways.
JOB.24.24	They are exalted a little while, then they are gone;
JOB.24.24	Moreover, they are brought low and like everything gathered up;
JOB.24.24	Even like the heads of grain they are cut off.
JOB.24.25	Now if it is not so, who can prove me a liar,
JOB.24.25	And make my speech worthless?”
JOB.25.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
JOB.25.2	“Dominion and awe belong to Him
JOB.25.2	Who establishes peace in His heights.
JOB.25.3	Is there any number to His troops?
JOB.25.3	And upon whom does His light not rise?
JOB.25.4	How then can a man be just with God?
JOB.25.4	Or how can he be clean who is born of woman?
JOB.25.5	If even the moon has no brightness
JOB.25.5	And the stars are not pure in His sight,
JOB.25.6	How much less man, 
JOB.25.6	And the son of man, 
JOB.26.1	Then Job responded,
JOB.26.2	“What a help you are to the weak!
JOB.26.2	How you have saved the arm without strength!
JOB.26.3	What counsel you have given to 
JOB.26.3	What helpful insight you have abundantly provided!
JOB.26.4	To whom have you uttered words?
JOB.26.4	And whose spirit was expressed through you?
JOB.26.5	“The departed spirits tremble
JOB.26.5	Under the waters and their inhabitants.
JOB.26.6	Naked is Sheol before Him,
JOB.26.6	And 
JOB.26.7	He stretches out the north over empty space
JOB.26.7	And hangs the earth on nothing.
JOB.26.8	He wraps up the waters in His clouds,
JOB.26.8	And the cloud does not burst under them.
JOB.26.9	He obscures the face of the full moon
JOB.26.9	And spreads His cloud over it.
JOB.26.10	He has inscribed a circle on the surface of the waters
JOB.26.10	At the boundary of light and darkness.
JOB.26.11	The pillars of heaven tremble
JOB.26.11	And are amazed at His rebuke.
JOB.26.12	He quieted the sea with His power,
JOB.26.12	And by His understanding He shattered Rahab.
JOB.26.13	By His breath the heavens are cleared;
JOB.26.13	His hand has pierced the fleeing serpent.
JOB.26.14	Behold, these are the fringes of His ways;
JOB.26.14	And how faint a word we hear of Him!
JOB.26.14	But His mighty thunder, who can understand?”
JOB.27.1	Then Job continued his discourse and said,
JOB.27.2	“As God lives, who has taken away my right,
JOB.27.2	And the Almighty, who has embittered my soul,
JOB.27.3	For as long as life is in me,
JOB.27.3	And the breath of God is in my nostrils,
JOB.27.4	My lips certainly will not speak unjustly,
JOB.27.4	Nor will my tongue mutter deceit.
JOB.27.5	Far be it from me that I should declare you right;
JOB.27.5	Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
JOB.27.6	I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go.
JOB.27.6	My heart does not reproach any of my days.
JOB.27.7	“May my enemy be as the wicked
JOB.27.7	And my opponent as the unjust.
JOB.27.8	For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off,
JOB.27.8	When God requires his life?
JOB.27.9	Will God hear his cry
JOB.27.9	When distress comes upon him?
JOB.27.10	Will he take delight in the Almighty?
JOB.27.10	Will he call on God at all times?
JOB.27.11	I will instruct you in the power of God;
JOB.27.11	What is with the Almighty I will not conceal.
JOB.27.12	Behold, all of you have seen 
JOB.27.12	Why then do you act foolishly?
JOB.27.13	“This is the portion of a wicked man from God,
JOB.27.13	And the inheritance 
JOB.27.14	Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword;
JOB.27.14	And his descendants will not be satisfied with bread.
JOB.27.15	His survivors will be buried because of the plague,
JOB.27.15	And their widows will not be able to weep.
JOB.27.16	Though he piles up silver like dust
JOB.27.16	And prepares garments as 
JOB.27.17	He may prepare 
JOB.27.17	And the innocent will divide the silver.
JOB.27.18	He has built his house like the spider’s web,
JOB.27.18	Or as a hut 
JOB.27.19	He lies down rich, but never again;
JOB.27.19	He opens his eyes, and it is no longer.
JOB.27.20	Terrors overtake him like a flood;
JOB.27.20	A tempest steals him away in the night.
JOB.27.21	The east wind carries him away, and he is gone,
JOB.27.21	For it whirls him away from his place.
JOB.27.22	For it will hurl at him without sparing;
JOB.27.22	He will surely try to flee from its power.
JOB.27.23	And will hiss him from his place.
JOB.28.1	“Surely there is a 
JOB.28.1	And a place where they refine gold.
JOB.28.2	Iron is taken from the dust,
JOB.28.2	And copper is smelted from rock.
JOB.28.3	And to the farthest limit he searches out
JOB.28.3	The rock in gloom and deep shadow.
JOB.28.4	He sinks a shaft far from habitation,
JOB.28.4	Forgotten by the foot;
JOB.28.4	They hang and swing to and fro far from men.
JOB.28.5	The earth, from it comes food,
JOB.28.5	And underneath it is turned up as fire.
JOB.28.6	Its rocks are the source of sapphires,
JOB.28.6	And its dust 
JOB.28.7	The path no bird of prey knows,
JOB.28.7	Nor has the falcon’s eye caught sight of it.
JOB.28.8	The proud beasts have not trodden it,
JOB.28.8	Nor has the 
JOB.28.9	He puts his hand on the flint;
JOB.28.9	He overturns the mountains at the base.
JOB.28.10	He hews out channels through the rocks,
JOB.28.10	And his eye sees anything precious.
JOB.28.11	He dams up the streams from flowing,
JOB.28.11	And what is hidden he brings out to the light.
JOB.28.12	“But where can wisdom be found?
JOB.28.12	And where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.13	Man does not know its value,
JOB.28.13	Nor is it found in the land of the living.
JOB.28.14	The deep says, ‘It is not in me’;
JOB.28.14	And the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’
JOB.28.15	Pure gold cannot be given in exchange for it,
JOB.28.15	Nor can silver be weighed as its price.
JOB.28.16	It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir,
JOB.28.16	In precious onyx, or sapphire.
JOB.28.17	Gold or glass cannot equal it,
JOB.28.17	Nor can it be exchanged for articles of fine gold.
JOB.28.18	Coral and crystal are not to be mentioned;
JOB.28.18	And the acquisition of wisdom is above 
JOB.28.19	The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it,
JOB.28.19	Nor can it be valued in pure gold.
JOB.28.20	Where then does wisdom come from?
JOB.28.20	And where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.21	Thus it is hidden from the eyes of all living
JOB.28.21	And concealed from the birds of the sky.
JOB.28.22	‘With our ears we have heard a report of it.’
JOB.28.23	“God understands its way,
JOB.28.23	And He knows its place.
JOB.28.24	For He looks to the ends of the earth
JOB.28.24	And sees everything under the heavens.
JOB.28.25	When He imparted weight to the wind
JOB.28.25	And meted out the waters by measure,
JOB.28.26	When He set a limit for the rain
JOB.28.26	And a course for the thunderbolt,
JOB.28.27	Then He saw it and declared it;
JOB.28.27	He established it and also searched it out.
JOB.28.28	And to man He said, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;
JOB.28.28	And to depart from evil is understanding.’ ”
JOB.29.1	And Job again took up his discourse and said,
JOB.29.2	“Oh that I were as in months gone by,
JOB.29.2	As in the days when God watched over me;
JOB.29.3	When His lamp shone over my head,
JOB.29.4	As I was in 
JOB.29.4	When the friendship of God 
JOB.29.5	When the Almighty was yet with me,
JOB.29.6	When my steps were bathed in butter,
JOB.29.6	And the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
JOB.29.7	When I went out to the gate of the city,
JOB.29.7	When I took my seat in the square,
JOB.29.8	The young men saw me and hid themselves,
JOB.29.8	And the old men arose 
JOB.29.9	The princes stopped talking
JOB.29.9	And put 
JOB.29.10	The voice of the nobles was hushed,
JOB.29.10	And their tongue stuck to their palate.
JOB.29.11	For when the ear heard, it called me blessed,
JOB.29.11	And when the eye saw, it gave witness of me,
JOB.29.12	Because I delivered the poor who cried for help,
JOB.29.12	And the orphan who had no helper.
JOB.29.13	The blessing of the one ready to perish came upon me,
JOB.29.13	And I made the widow’s heart sing for joy.
JOB.29.14	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me;
JOB.29.14	My justice was like a robe and a turban.
JOB.29.15	I was eyes to the blind
JOB.29.15	And feet to the lame.
JOB.29.16	I was a father to the needy,
JOB.29.16	And I investigated the case which I did not know.
JOB.29.17	I broke the jaws of the wicked
JOB.29.17	And snatched the prey from his teeth.
JOB.29.18	Then I thought, ‘I shall die in my nest,
JOB.29.18	And I shall multiply 
JOB.29.19	My root is spread out to the waters,
JOB.29.19	And dew lies all night on my branch.
JOB.29.20	My glory is 
JOB.29.20	And my bow is renewed in my hand.’
JOB.29.21	“To me they listened and waited,
JOB.29.21	And kept silent for my counsel.
JOB.29.22	After my words they did not speak again,
JOB.29.22	And my speech dropped on them.
JOB.29.23	They waited for me as for the rain,
JOB.29.23	And opened their mouth as for the spring rain.
JOB.29.24	I smiled on them when they did not believe,
JOB.29.24	And the light of my face they did not cast down.
JOB.29.25	I chose a way for them and sat as chief,
JOB.29.25	And dwelt as a king among the troops,
JOB.29.25	As one who comforted the mourners.
JOB.30.1	“But now those younger than I mock me,
JOB.30.1	Whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock.
JOB.30.2	Indeed, what 
JOB.30.2	Vigor had perished from them.
JOB.30.3	From want and famine they are gaunt
JOB.30.3	Who gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation,
JOB.30.4	Who pluck 
JOB.30.4	And whose food is the root of the broom shrub.
JOB.30.5	They are driven from the community;
JOB.30.5	They shout against them as 
JOB.30.6	So that they dwell in dreadful valleys,
JOB.30.6	In holes of the earth and of the rocks.
JOB.30.7	Among the bushes they cry out;
JOB.30.7	Under the nettles they are gathered together.
JOB.30.8	Fools, even those without a name,
JOB.30.8	They were scourged from the land.
JOB.30.9	“And now I have become their taunt,
JOB.30.9	I have even become a byword to them.
JOB.30.10	They abhor me 
JOB.30.10	And they do not refrain from spitting at my face.
JOB.30.11	Because He has loosed His bowstring and afflicted me,
JOB.30.11	They have cast off the bridle before me.
JOB.30.12	On the right hand their brood arises;
JOB.30.12	They thrust aside my feet and build up against me their ways of destruction.
JOB.30.13	They break up my path,
JOB.30.13	They profit from my destruction;
JOB.30.13	No one restrains them.
JOB.30.14	As 
JOB.30.14	Amid the tempest they roll on.
JOB.30.15	Terrors are turned against me;
JOB.30.15	They pursue my honor as the wind,
JOB.30.15	And my prosperity has passed away like a cloud.
JOB.30.16	“And now my soul is poured out within me;
JOB.30.16	Days of affliction have seized me.
JOB.30.17	At night it pierces my bones within me,
JOB.30.17	And my gnawing 
JOB.30.18	By a great force my garment is distorted;
JOB.30.18	It binds me about as the collar of my coat.
JOB.30.19	He has cast me into the mire,
JOB.30.19	And I have become like dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer me;
JOB.30.20	I stand up, and You turn Your attention against me.
JOB.30.21	You have become cruel to me;
JOB.30.21	With the might of Your hand You persecute me.
JOB.30.22	You lift me up to the wind 
JOB.30.22	And You dissolve me in a storm.
JOB.30.23	For I know that You will bring me to death
JOB.30.23	And to the house of meeting for all living.
JOB.30.24	“Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out 
JOB.30.24	Or in his disaster therefore cry out for help?
JOB.30.25	Have I not wept for the one whose life is hard?
JOB.30.25	Was not my soul grieved for the needy?
JOB.30.26	When I expected good, then evil came;
JOB.30.26	When I waited for light, then darkness came.
JOB.30.27	I am seething within and cannot relax;
JOB.30.27	Days of affliction confront me.
JOB.30.28	I go about mourning without comfort;
JOB.30.28	I stand up in the assembly 
JOB.30.29	I have become a brother to jackals
JOB.30.29	And a companion of ostriches.
JOB.30.30	My skin turns black on me,
JOB.30.30	And my bones burn with fever.
JOB.30.31	Therefore my harp is turned to mourning,
JOB.30.31	And my flute to the sound of those who weep.
JOB.31.1	“I have made a covenant with my eyes;
JOB.31.1	How then could I gaze at a virgin?
JOB.31.2	And what is the portion of God from above
JOB.31.2	Or the heritage of the Almighty from on high?
JOB.31.3	Is it not calamity to the unjust
JOB.31.3	And disaster to those who work iniquity?
JOB.31.4	Does He not see my ways
JOB.31.4	And number all my steps?
JOB.31.5	“If I have walked with falsehood,
JOB.31.5	And my foot has hastened after deceit,
JOB.31.6	Let Him weigh me with accurate scales,
JOB.31.6	And let God know my integrity.
JOB.31.7	If my step has turned from the way,
JOB.31.7	Or my heart followed my eyes,
JOB.31.7	Or if any spot has stuck to my hands,
JOB.31.8	Let me sow and another eat,
JOB.31.8	And let my crops be uprooted.
JOB.31.9	“If my heart has been enticed by a woman,
JOB.31.9	Or I have lurked at my neighbor’s doorway,
JOB.31.10	May my wife grind for another,
JOB.31.10	And let others kneel down over her.
JOB.31.11	For that would be a lustful crime;
JOB.31.11	Moreover, it would be an iniquity 
JOB.31.12	For it would be fire that consumes to Abaddon,
JOB.31.12	And would uproot all my increase.
JOB.31.13	“If I have despised the claim of my male or female slaves
JOB.31.13	When they filed a complaint against me,
JOB.31.14	What then could I do when God arises?
JOB.31.14	And when He calls me to account, what will I answer Him?
JOB.31.15	Did not He who made me in the womb make him,
JOB.31.15	And the same one fashion us in the womb?
JOB.31.16	“If I have kept the poor from 
JOB.31.16	Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
JOB.31.17	Or have eaten my morsel alone,
JOB.31.17	And the orphan has not shared it
JOB.31.18	(But from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,
JOB.31.18	And from infancy I guided her),
JOB.31.19	If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing,
JOB.31.19	Or that the needy had no covering,
JOB.31.20	If his loins have not thanked me,
JOB.31.20	And if he has not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep,
JOB.31.21	If I have lifted up my hand against the orphan,
JOB.31.21	Because I saw I had support in the gate,
JOB.31.22	Let my shoulder fall from the socket,
JOB.31.22	And my arm be broken off at the elbow.
JOB.31.23	For calamity from God is a terror to me,
JOB.31.23	And because of His majesty I can do nothing.
JOB.31.24	“If I have put my confidence 
JOB.31.24	And called fine gold my trust,
JOB.31.25	If I have gloated because my wealth was great,
JOB.31.25	And because my hand had secured 
JOB.31.26	If I have looked at the sun when it shone
JOB.31.26	Or the moon going in splendor,
JOB.31.27	And my heart became secretly enticed,
JOB.31.27	And my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,
JOB.31.28	That too would have been an iniquity 
JOB.31.28	For I would have denied God above.
JOB.31.29	“Have I rejoiced at the extinction of my enemy,
JOB.31.29	Or exulted when evil befell him?
JOB.31.30	No, I have not allowed my mouth to sin
JOB.31.30	By asking for his life in a curse.
JOB.31.31	Have the men of my tent not said,
JOB.31.31	‘Who can find one who has not been satisfied with his meat’?
JOB.31.32	The alien has not lodged outside,
JOB.31.33	Have I covered my transgressions like Adam,
JOB.31.33	By hiding my iniquity in my bosom,
JOB.31.34	Because I feared the great multitude,
JOB.31.34	And the contempt of families terrified me,
JOB.31.34	And kept silent and did not go out of doors?
JOB.31.35	Oh that I had one to hear me!
JOB.31.35	Behold, here is my signature;
JOB.31.35	Let the Almighty answer me!
JOB.31.35	And the indictment which my adversary has written,
JOB.31.36	Surely I would carry it on my shoulder,
JOB.31.36	I would bind it to myself like a crown.
JOB.31.37	I would declare to Him the number of my steps;
JOB.31.37	Like a prince I would approach Him.
JOB.31.38	“If my land cries out against me,
JOB.31.38	And its furrows weep together;
JOB.31.39	If I have eaten its fruit without money,
JOB.31.39	Or have caused its owners to lose their lives,
JOB.31.40	Let briars grow instead of wheat,
JOB.31.40	And stinkweed instead of barley.”
JOB.31.40	The words of Job are ended.
JOB.32.1	Then these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 
JOB.32.2	But the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram burned; against Job his anger burned because he justified himself before God. 
JOB.32.3	And his anger burned against his three friends because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 
JOB.32.4	Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were years older than he. 
JOB.32.5	And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men his anger burned.
JOB.32.6	So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite spoke out and said,
JOB.32.6	“I am young in years and you are old;
JOB.32.6	Therefore I was shy and afraid to tell you what I think.
JOB.32.7	I thought age should speak,
JOB.32.7	And increased years should teach wisdom.
JOB.32.8	But it is a spirit in man,
JOB.32.8	And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.
JOB.32.9	The abundant 
JOB.32.9	Nor may elders understand justice.
JOB.32.10	So I say, ‘Listen to me,
JOB.32.10	I too will tell what I think.’
JOB.32.11	“Behold, I waited for your words,
JOB.32.11	I listened to your reasonings,
JOB.32.11	While you pondered what to say.
JOB.32.12	I even paid close attention to you;
JOB.32.12	Indeed, there was no one who refuted Job,
JOB.32.12	Not one of you who answered his words.
JOB.32.13	Do not say,
JOB.32.13	‘We have found wisdom;
JOB.32.13	God will rout him, not man.’
JOB.32.14	For he has not arranged 
JOB.32.14	Nor will I reply to him with your arguments.
JOB.32.15	“They are dismayed, they no longer answer;
JOB.32.15	Words have failed them.
JOB.32.16	Shall I wait, because they do not speak,
JOB.32.16	Because they stop 
JOB.32.17	I too will answer my share,
JOB.32.17	I also will tell my opinion.
JOB.32.18	For I am full of words;
JOB.32.18	The spirit within me constrains me.
JOB.32.19	Behold, my belly is like unvented wine,
JOB.32.19	Like new wineskins it is about to burst.
JOB.32.20	Let me speak that I may get relief;
JOB.32.20	Let me open my lips and answer.
JOB.32.21	Let me now be partial to no one,
JOB.32.21	Nor flatter 
JOB.32.22	For I do not know how to flatter,
JOB.33.1	“However now, Job, please hear my speech,
JOB.33.1	And listen to all my words.
JOB.33.2	Behold now, I open my mouth,
JOB.33.2	My tongue in my mouth speaks.
JOB.33.3	My words are 
JOB.33.3	And my lips speak knowledge sincerely.
JOB.33.4	The Spirit of God has made me,
JOB.33.4	And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
JOB.33.5	Refute me if you can;
JOB.33.5	Array yourselves before me, take your stand.
JOB.33.6	Behold, I belong to God like you;
JOB.33.6	I too have been formed out of the clay.
JOB.33.7	Behold, no fear of me should terrify you,
JOB.33.7	Nor should my pressure weigh heavily on you.
JOB.33.8	“Surely you have spoken in my hearing,
JOB.33.8	And I have heard the sound of 
JOB.33.9	‘I am pure, without transgression;
JOB.33.9	I am innocent and there is no guilt in me.
JOB.33.10	Behold, He invents pretexts against me;
JOB.33.10	He counts me as His enemy.
JOB.33.11	He puts my feet in the stocks;
JOB.33.11	He watches all my paths.’
JOB.33.12	Behold, let me tell you, you are not right in this,
JOB.33.12	For God is greater than man.
JOB.33.13	“Why do you complain against Him
JOB.33.13	That He does not give an account of all His doings?
JOB.33.14	Indeed God speaks once,
JOB.33.14	Or twice, 
JOB.33.15	In a dream, a vision of the night,
JOB.33.15	When sound sleep falls on men,
JOB.33.15	While they slumber in their beds,
JOB.33.16	Then He opens the ears of men,
JOB.33.16	And seals their instruction,
JOB.33.17	That He may turn man aside 
JOB.33.17	And keep man from pride;
JOB.33.18	He keeps back his soul from the pit,
JOB.33.18	And his life from passing over into Sheol.
JOB.33.19	“Man is also chastened with pain on his bed,
JOB.33.19	And with unceasing complaint in his bones;
JOB.33.20	So that his life loathes bread,
JOB.33.20	And his soul favorite food.
JOB.33.21	His flesh wastes away from sight,
JOB.33.21	And his bones which were not seen stick out.
JOB.33.22	Then his soul draws near to the pit,
JOB.33.22	And his life to those who bring death.
JOB.33.23	“If there is an angel 
JOB.33.23	One out of a thousand,
JOB.33.23	To remind a man what is right for him,
JOB.33.24	Then let him be gracious to him, and say,
JOB.33.24	‘Deliver him from going down to the pit,
JOB.33.24	I have found a ransom’;
JOB.33.25	Let his flesh become fresher than in youth,
JOB.33.25	Let him return to the days of his youthful vigor;
JOB.33.26	Then he will pray to God, and He will accept him,
JOB.33.26	That he may see His face with joy,
JOB.33.26	And He may restore His righteousness to man.
JOB.33.27	He will sing to men and say,
JOB.33.27	‘I have sinned and perverted what is right,
JOB.33.27	And it is not proper for me.
JOB.33.28	He has redeemed my soul from going to the pit,
JOB.33.28	And my life shall see the light.’
JOB.33.29	“Behold, God does all these oftentimes with men,
JOB.33.30	To bring back his soul from the pit,
JOB.33.30	That he may be enlightened with the light of life.
JOB.33.31	Pay attention, O Job, listen to me;
JOB.33.31	Keep silent, and let me speak.
JOB.33.32	Speak, for I desire to justify you.
JOB.33.33	If not, listen to me;
JOB.33.33	Keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”
JOB.34.1	Then Elihu continued and said,
JOB.34.2	“Hear my words, you wise men,
JOB.34.2	And listen to me, you who know.
JOB.34.3	For the ear tests words
JOB.34.3	As the palate tastes food.
JOB.34.4	Let us choose for ourselves what is right;
JOB.34.4	Let us know among ourselves what is good.
JOB.34.5	For Job has said, ‘I am righteous,
JOB.34.5	But God has taken away my right;
JOB.34.6	Should I lie concerning my right?
JOB.34.6	My wound is incurable, 
JOB.34.7	What man is like Job,
JOB.34.7	Who drinks up derision like water,
JOB.34.8	Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,
JOB.34.8	And walks with wicked men?
JOB.34.9	For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing
JOB.34.9	When he is pleased with God.’
JOB.34.10	“Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding.
JOB.34.10	Far be it from God to do wickedness,
JOB.34.10	And from the Almighty to do wrong.
JOB.34.11	For He pays a man according to his work,
JOB.34.11	And makes him find it according to his way.
JOB.34.12	Surely, God will not act wickedly,
JOB.34.12	And the Almighty will not pervert justice.
JOB.34.13	Who gave Him authority over the earth?
JOB.34.13	And who has laid 
JOB.34.14	If He should determine to do so,
JOB.34.14	If He should gather to Himself His spirit and His breath,
JOB.34.15	All flesh would perish together,
JOB.34.15	And man would return to dust.
JOB.34.16	“But if 
JOB.34.16	Listen to the sound of my words.
JOB.34.17	Shall one who hates justice rule?
JOB.34.17	And will you condemn the righteous mighty One,
JOB.34.18	Who says to a king, ‘Worthless one,’
JOB.34.18	To nobles, ‘Wicked ones’;
JOB.34.19	Who shows no partiality to princes
JOB.34.19	Nor regards the rich above the poor,
JOB.34.19	For they all are the work of His hands?
JOB.34.20	In a moment they die, and at midnight
JOB.34.20	People are shaken and pass away,
JOB.34.20	And the mighty are taken away without a hand.
JOB.34.21	“For His eyes are upon the ways of a man,
JOB.34.21	And He sees all his steps.
JOB.34.22	There is no darkness or deep shadow
JOB.34.22	Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
JOB.34.23	For He does not 
JOB.34.23	That he should go before God in judgment.
JOB.34.24	He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry,
JOB.34.24	And sets others in their place.
JOB.34.25	Therefore He knows their works,
JOB.34.25	And He overthrows 
JOB.34.25	And they are crushed.
JOB.34.26	He strikes them like the wicked
JOB.34.26	In a public place,
JOB.34.27	Because they turned aside from following Him,
JOB.34.27	And had no regard for any of His ways;
JOB.34.28	So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him,
JOB.34.28	And that He might hear the cry of the afflicted—
JOB.34.29	When He keeps quiet, who then can condemn?
JOB.34.29	And when He hides His face, who then can behold Him,
JOB.34.29	That is, in regard to both nation and man?—
JOB.34.30	So that godless men would not rule
JOB.34.30	Nor be snares of the people.
JOB.34.31	“For has anyone said to God,
JOB.34.31	‘I have borne 
JOB.34.31	I will not offend 
JOB.34.32	Teach me what I do not see;
JOB.34.32	If I have done iniquity,
JOB.34.32	I will not do it again’?
JOB.34.33	Shall He recompense on your terms, because you have rejected 
JOB.34.33	For you must choose, and not I;
JOB.34.33	Therefore declare what you know.
JOB.34.34	Men of understanding will say to me,
JOB.34.34	And a wise man who hears me,
JOB.34.35	‘Job speaks without knowledge,
JOB.34.35	And his words are without wisdom.
JOB.34.36	Job ought to be tried to the limit,
JOB.34.36	Because he answers like wicked men.
JOB.34.37	For he adds rebellion to his sin;
JOB.34.37	He claps his hands among us,
JOB.34.37	And multiplies his words against God.’ ”
JOB.35.1	Then Elihu continued and said,
JOB.35.2	“Do you think this is according to justice?
JOB.35.2	Do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s’?
JOB.35.3	For you say, ‘What advantage will it be to You?
JOB.35.3	What profit will I have, more than if I had sinned?’
JOB.35.4	I will answer you,
JOB.35.4	And your friends with you.
JOB.35.5	Look at the heavens and see;
JOB.35.5	And behold the clouds—they are higher than you.
JOB.35.6	If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against Him?
JOB.35.6	And if your transgressions are many, what do you do to Him?
JOB.35.7	If you are righteous, what do you give to Him,
JOB.35.7	Or what does He receive from your hand?
JOB.35.8	Your wickedness is for a man like yourself,
JOB.35.8	And your righteousness is for a son of man.
JOB.35.9	“Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;
JOB.35.9	They cry for help because of the arm of the mighty.
JOB.35.10	But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker,
JOB.35.10	Who gives songs in the night,
JOB.35.11	Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth
JOB.35.11	And makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?’
JOB.35.12	There they cry out, but He does not answer
JOB.35.12	Because of the pride of evil men.
JOB.35.13	Surely God will not listen to an empty 
JOB.35.13	Nor will the Almighty regard it.
JOB.35.14	How much less when you say you do not behold Him,
JOB.35.14	The case is before Him, and you must wait for Him!
JOB.35.15	And now, because He has not visited 
JOB.35.15	Nor has He acknowledged transgression well,
JOB.35.16	So Job opens his mouth emptily;
JOB.35.16	He multiplies words without knowledge.”
JOB.36.1	Then Elihu continued and said,
JOB.36.2	“Wait for me a little, and I will show you
JOB.36.2	That there is yet more to be said in God’s behalf.
JOB.36.3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar,
JOB.36.3	And I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
JOB.36.4	For truly my words are not false;
JOB.36.4	One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
JOB.36.5	Behold, God is mighty but does not despise 
JOB.36.6	He does not keep the wicked alive,
JOB.36.6	But gives justice to the afflicted.
JOB.36.7	He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous;
JOB.36.7	But with kings on the throne
JOB.36.7	He has seated them forever, and they are exalted.
JOB.36.8	And if they are bound in fetters,
JOB.36.8	And are caught in the cords of affliction,
JOB.36.9	Then He declares to them their work
JOB.36.9	And their transgressions, that they have magnified themselves.
JOB.36.10	He opens their ear to instruction,
JOB.36.10	And commands that they return from evil.
JOB.36.11	If they hear and serve 
JOB.36.11	They will end their days in prosperity
JOB.36.11	And their years in pleasures.
JOB.36.12	But if they do not hear, they shall perish by the sword
JOB.36.12	And they will die without knowledge.
JOB.36.13	But the godless in heart lay up anger;
JOB.36.13	They do not cry for help when He binds them.
JOB.36.14	They die in youth,
JOB.36.14	And their life 
JOB.36.15	He delivers the afflicted in their affliction,
JOB.36.15	And opens their ear in 
JOB.36.16	Then indeed, He enticed you from the mouth of distress,
JOB.36.16	Instead of it, a broad place with no constraint;
JOB.36.16	And that which was set on your table was full of fatness.
JOB.36.17	“But you were full of judgment on the wicked;
JOB.36.17	Judgment and justice take hold 
JOB.36.18	And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.
JOB.36.19	Will your riches keep you from distress,
JOB.36.19	Or all the forces of 
JOB.36.20	Do not long for the night,
JOB.36.20	When people vanish in their place.
JOB.36.21	Be careful, do not turn to evil,
JOB.36.21	For you have preferred this to affliction.
JOB.36.22	Behold, God is exalted in His power;
JOB.36.22	Who is a teacher like Him?
JOB.36.23	Who has appointed Him His way,
JOB.36.23	And who has said, ‘You have done wrong’?
JOB.36.24	“Remember that you should exalt His work,
JOB.36.24	Of which men have sung.
JOB.36.25	All men have seen it;
JOB.36.25	Man beholds from afar.
JOB.36.26	Behold, God is exalted, and we do not know 
JOB.36.26	The number of His years is unsearchable.
JOB.36.27	For He draws up the drops of water,
JOB.36.27	They distill rain from the mist,
JOB.36.28	Which the clouds pour down,
JOB.36.28	They drip upon man abundantly.
JOB.36.29	Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds,
JOB.36.29	The thundering of His pavilion?
JOB.36.30	Behold, He spreads His lightning about Him,
JOB.36.30	And He covers the depths of the sea.
JOB.36.31	For by these He judges peoples;
JOB.36.31	He gives food in abundance.
JOB.36.32	He covers 
JOB.36.32	And commands it to strike the mark.
JOB.36.33	Its noise declares His presence;
JOB.36.33	The cattle also, concerning what is coming up.
JOB.37.1	“At this also my heart trembles,
JOB.37.1	And leaps from its place.
JOB.37.2	Listen closely to the thunder of His voice,
JOB.37.2	And the rumbling that goes out from His mouth.
JOB.37.3	Under the whole heaven He lets it loose,
JOB.37.3	And His lightning to the ends of the earth.
JOB.37.4	After it, a voice roars;
JOB.37.4	He thunders with His majestic voice,
JOB.37.4	And He does not restrain the lightnings when His voice is heard.
JOB.37.5	God thunders with His voice wondrously,
JOB.37.5	Doing great things which we cannot comprehend.
JOB.37.6	For to the snow He says, ‘Fall on the earth,’
JOB.37.6	And to the downpour and the rain, ‘Be strong.’
JOB.37.7	He seals the hand of every man,
JOB.37.7	That all men may know His work.
JOB.37.8	Then the beast goes into its lair
JOB.37.8	And remains in its den.
JOB.37.9	Out of the south comes the storm,
JOB.37.9	And out of the north the cold.
JOB.37.10	From the breath of God ice is made,
JOB.37.10	And the expanse of the waters is frozen.
JOB.37.11	Also with moisture He loads the thick cloud;
JOB.37.11	He disperses the cloud of His lightning.
JOB.37.12	It changes direction, turning around by His guidance,
JOB.37.12	That it may do whatever He commands it
JOB.37.12	On the face of the inhabited earth.
JOB.37.13	Whether for correction, or for His world,
JOB.37.13	Or for lovingkindness, He causes it to happen.
JOB.37.14	“Listen to this, O Job,
JOB.37.14	Stand and consider the wonders of God.
JOB.37.15	Do you know how God establishes them,
JOB.37.15	And makes the lightning of His cloud to shine?
JOB.37.16	Do you know about the layers of the thick clouds,
JOB.37.16	The wonders of one perfect in knowledge,
JOB.37.17	You whose garments are hot,
JOB.37.17	When the land is still because of the south wind?
JOB.37.18	Can you, with Him, spread out the skies,
JOB.37.18	Strong as a molten mirror?
JOB.37.19	Teach us what we shall say to Him;
JOB.37.19	We cannot arrange 
JOB.37.20	Shall it be told Him that I would speak?
JOB.37.20	Or should a man say that he would be swallowed up?
JOB.37.21	“Now men do not see the light which is bright in the skies;
JOB.37.21	But the wind has passed and cleared them.
JOB.37.22	Out of the north comes golden 
JOB.37.22	Around God is awesome majesty.
JOB.37.23	The Almighty—we cannot find Him;
JOB.37.23	He is exalted in power
JOB.37.23	And He will not do violence to justice and abundant righteousness.
JOB.37.24	Therefore men fear Him;
JOB.37.24	He does not regard any who are wise of heart.”
JOB.38.1	Then the L
JOB.38.2	“Who is this that darkens counsel
JOB.38.2	By words without knowledge?
JOB.38.3	Now gird up your loins like a man,
JOB.38.3	And I will ask you, and you instruct Me!
JOB.38.4	Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
JOB.38.4	Tell 
JOB.38.5	Who set its measurements? Since you know.
JOB.38.5	Or who stretched the line on it?
JOB.38.6	On what were its bases sunk?
JOB.38.6	Or who laid its cornerstone,
JOB.38.7	When the morning stars sang together
JOB.38.7	And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
JOB.38.8	“Or 
JOB.38.8	When, bursting forth, it went out from the womb;
JOB.38.9	When I made a cloud its garment
JOB.38.9	And thick darkness its swaddling band,
JOB.38.10	And I placed boundaries on it
JOB.38.10	And set a bolt and doors,
JOB.38.11	And I said, ‘Thus far you shall come, but no farther;
JOB.38.11	And here shall your proud waves stop’?
JOB.38.12	“Have you ever in your life commanded the morning,
JOB.38.13	That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,
JOB.38.13	And the wicked be shaken out of it?
JOB.38.14	It is changed like clay 
JOB.38.14	And they stand forth like a garment.
JOB.38.15	From the wicked their light is withheld,
JOB.38.15	And the uplifted arm is broken.
JOB.38.16	“Have you entered into the springs of the sea
JOB.38.16	Or walked in the recesses of the deep?
JOB.38.17	Have the gates of death been revealed to you,
JOB.38.17	Or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?
JOB.38.18	Have you understood the expanse of the earth?
JOB.38.18	Tell 
JOB.38.19	“Where is the way to the dwelling of light?
JOB.38.19	And darkness, where is its place,
JOB.38.20	That you may take it to its territory
JOB.38.20	And that you may discern the paths to its home?
JOB.38.21	You know, for you were born then,
JOB.38.21	And the number of your days is great!
JOB.38.22	Have you entered the storehouses of the snow,
JOB.38.22	Or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,
JOB.38.23	Which I have reserved for the time of distress,
JOB.38.23	For the day of war and battle?
JOB.38.24	Where is the way that the light is divided,
JOB.38.25	“Who has cleft a channel for the flood,
JOB.38.25	Or a way for the thunderbolt,
JOB.38.26	To bring rain on a land without people,
JOB.38.27	To satisfy the waste and desolate land
JOB.38.27	And to make the seeds of grass to sprout?
JOB.38.28	Has the rain a father?
JOB.38.28	Or who has begotten the drops of dew?
JOB.38.29	From whose womb has come the ice?
JOB.38.29	And the frost of heaven, who has given it birth?
JOB.38.30	Water becomes hard like stone,
JOB.38.30	And the surface of the deep is imprisoned.
JOB.38.31	“Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades,
JOB.38.31	Or loose the cords of Orion?
JOB.38.32	Can you lead forth a constellation in its season,
JOB.38.32	And guide the Bear with her satellites?
JOB.38.33	Do you know the ordinances of the heavens,
JOB.38.33	Or fix their rule over the earth?
JOB.38.34	“Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,
JOB.38.34	So that an abundance of water will cover you?
JOB.38.35	Can you send forth lightnings that they may go
JOB.38.35	And say to you, ‘Here we are’?
JOB.38.36	Who has put wisdom in the innermost being
JOB.38.36	Or given understanding to the mind?
JOB.38.37	Who can count the clouds by wisdom,
JOB.38.37	Or tip the water jars of the heavens,
JOB.38.38	When the dust hardens into a mass
JOB.38.38	And the clods stick together?
JOB.38.39	“Can you hunt the prey for the lion,
JOB.38.39	Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
JOB.38.40	When they crouch in 
JOB.38.41	Who prepares for the raven its nourishment
JOB.38.41	When its young cry to God
JOB.38.41	And wander about without food?
JOB.39.1	“Do you know the time the mountain goats give birth?
JOB.39.1	Do you observe the calving of the deer?
JOB.39.2	Can you count the months they fulfill,
JOB.39.2	Or do you know the time they give birth?
JOB.39.3	They kneel down, they bring forth their young,
JOB.39.3	They get rid of their labor pains.
JOB.39.4	Their offspring become strong, they grow up in the open field;
JOB.39.4	They leave and do not return to them.

JOB.39.5	And who loosed the bonds of the swift donkey,
JOB.39.6	To whom I gave the wilderness for a home
JOB.39.6	And the salt land for his dwelling place?
JOB.39.7	He scorns the tumult of the city,
JOB.39.7	The shoutings of the driver he does not hear.
JOB.39.8	He explores the mountains for his pasture
JOB.39.8	And searches after every green thing.
JOB.39.9	Will the wild ox consent to serve you,
JOB.39.9	Or will he spend the night at your manger?
JOB.39.10	Can you bind the wild ox in a furrow with ropes,
JOB.39.10	Or will he harrow the valleys after you?
JOB.39.11	Will you trust him because his strength is great
JOB.39.11	And leave your labor to him?

JOB.39.15	And she forgets that a foot may crush them,
JOB.39.15	Or that a wild beast may trample them.
JOB.39.16	She treats her young cruelly, as if 
JOB.39.16	Though her labor be in vain, 
JOB.39.17	Because God has made her forget wisdom,
JOB.39.17	And has not given her a share of understanding.
JOB.39.18	When she lifts herself on high,
JOB.39.18	She laughs at the horse and his rider.
JOB.39.19	“Do you give the horse 
JOB.39.19	Do you clothe his neck with a mane?
JOB.39.20	Do you make him leap like the locust?
JOB.39.20	His majestic snorting is terrible.
JOB.39.21	He paws in the valley, and rejoices in 
JOB.39.21	He goes out to meet the weapons.
JOB.39.22	He laughs at fear and is not dismayed;
JOB.39.22	And he does not turn back from the sword.
JOB.39.23	The quiver rattles against him,
JOB.39.23	The flashing spear and javelin.
JOB.39.24	With shaking and rage he races over the ground,
JOB.39.24	And he does not stand still at the voice of the trumpet.
JOB.39.25	As often as the trumpet 
JOB.39.25	And he scents the battle from afar,
JOB.39.25	And the thunder of the captains and the war cry.
JOB.39.26	“Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars,
JOB.39.26	Stretching his wings toward the south?
JOB.39.27	Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up
JOB.39.27	And makes his nest on high?
JOB.39.28	On the cliff he dwells and lodges,
JOB.39.28	Upon the rocky crag, an inaccessible place.
JOB.39.29	From there he spies out food;
JOB.39.29	His eyes see

JOB.39.30	And where the slain are, there is he.”
JOB.40.1	Then the L
JOB.40.2	“Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty?
JOB.40.2	Let him who reproves God answer it.”
JOB.40.3	Then Job answered the L
JOB.40.4	“Behold, I am insignificant; what can I reply to You?
JOB.40.4	I lay my hand on my mouth.
JOB.40.5	Once I have spoken, and I will not answer;
JOB.40.5	Even twice, and I will add nothing more.”
JOB.40.6	Then the L
JOB.40.7	“Now gird up your loins like a man;
JOB.40.7	I will ask you, and you instruct Me.
JOB.40.8	Will you really annul My judgment?
JOB.40.8	Will you condemn Me that you may be justified?
JOB.40.9	Or do you have an arm like God,
JOB.40.9	And can you thunder with a voice like His?
JOB.40.10	“Adorn yourself with eminence and dignity,
JOB.40.10	And clothe yourself with honor and majesty.
JOB.40.11	Pour out the overflowings of your anger,
JOB.40.11	And look on everyone who is proud, and make him low.
JOB.40.12	Look on everyone who is proud, 
JOB.40.12	And tread down the wicked where they stand.
JOB.40.13	Hide them in the dust together;
JOB.40.13	Bind them in the hidden 
JOB.40.14	Then I will also confess to you,
JOB.40.14	That your own right hand can save you.
JOB.40.15	“Behold now, 
JOB.40.15	He eats grass like an ox.
JOB.40.16	Behold now, his strength in his loins
JOB.40.16	And his power in the muscles of his belly.
JOB.40.17	He bends his tail like a cedar;
JOB.40.17	The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
JOB.40.18	His bones are tubes of bronze;
JOB.40.18	His limbs are like bars of iron.
JOB.40.19	“He is the first of the ways of God;
JOB.40.19	Let his maker bring near his sword.
JOB.40.20	Surely the mountains bring him food,
JOB.40.20	And all the beasts of the field play there.
JOB.40.21	Under the lotus plants he lies down,
JOB.40.21	In the covert of the reeds and the marsh.
JOB.40.22	The lotus plants cover him with shade;
JOB.40.22	The willows of the brook surround him.
JOB.40.23	If a river rages, he is not alarmed;
JOB.40.23	He is confident, though the Jordan rushes to his mouth.
JOB.40.24	Can anyone capture him when he is on watch,
JOB.40.24	With barbs can anyone pierce 
JOB.41.1	“Can you draw out 
JOB.41.1	Or press down his tongue with a cord?
JOB.41.2	Can you put a rope in his nose
JOB.41.2	Or pierce his jaw with a hook?
JOB.41.3	Will he make many supplications to you,
JOB.41.3	Or will he speak to you soft words?
JOB.41.4	Will he make a covenant with you?
JOB.41.4	Will you take him for a servant forever?
JOB.41.5	Will you play with him as with a bird,
JOB.41.5	Or will you bind him for your maidens?
JOB.41.6	Will the traders bargain over him?
JOB.41.6	Will they divide him among the merchants?
JOB.41.7	Can you fill his skin with harpoons,
JOB.41.7	Or his head with fishing spears?
JOB.41.8	Lay your hand on him;
JOB.41.8	Remember the battle; you will not do it again!
JOB.41.9	Behold, your expectation is false;
JOB.41.9	Will you be laid low even at the sight of him?
JOB.41.10	No one is so fierce that he dares to arouse him;
JOB.41.10	Who then is he that can stand before Me?
JOB.41.11	Who has given to Me that I should repay 
JOB.41.12	“I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,
JOB.41.12	Or his mighty strength, or his orderly frame.
JOB.41.13	Who can strip off his outer armor?
JOB.41.13	Who can come within his double mail?
JOB.41.14	Who can open the doors of his face?
JOB.41.14	Around his teeth there is terror.
JOB.41.15	Shut up 
JOB.41.16	One is so near to another
JOB.41.16	That no air can come between them.
JOB.41.17	They are joined one to another;
JOB.41.17	They clasp each other and cannot be separated.
JOB.41.18	His sneezes flash forth light,
JOB.41.18	And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
JOB.41.19	Out of his mouth go burning torches;
JOB.41.19	Sparks of fire leap forth.
JOB.41.20	Out of his nostrils smoke goes forth
JOB.41.20	As 
JOB.41.21	His breath kindles coals,
JOB.41.21	And a flame goes forth from his mouth.
JOB.41.22	In his neck lodges strength,
JOB.41.22	And dismay leaps before him.
JOB.41.23	The folds of his flesh are joined together,
JOB.41.23	Firm on him and immovable.
JOB.41.24	His heart is as hard as a stone,
JOB.41.24	Even as hard as a lower millstone.
JOB.41.25	When he raises himself up, the mighty fear;
JOB.41.25	Because of the crashing they are bewildered.
JOB.41.26	The sword that reaches him cannot avail,
JOB.41.26	Nor the spear, the dart or the javelin.
JOB.41.27	He regards iron as straw,
JOB.41.27	Bronze as rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	The arrow cannot make him flee;
JOB.41.28	Slingstones are turned into stubble for him.
JOB.41.29	Clubs are regarded as stubble;
JOB.41.29	He laughs at the rattling of the javelin.
JOB.41.30	His underparts are 
JOB.41.30	He spreads out 
JOB.41.31	He makes the depths boil like a pot;
JOB.41.31	He makes the sea like a jar of ointment.
JOB.41.32	Behind him he makes a wake to shine;
JOB.41.32	One would think the deep to be gray-haired.
JOB.41.33	Nothing on earth is like him,
JOB.41.33	One made without fear.
JOB.41.34	He looks on everything that is high;
JOB.41.34	He is king over all the sons of pride.”
JOB.42.1	Then Job answered the L
JOB.42.2	“I know that You can do all things,
JOB.42.2	And that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted.
JOB.42.3	‘Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?’
JOB.42.3	Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand,
JOB.42.3	Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
JOB.42.4	‘Hear, now, and I will speak;
JOB.42.4	I will ask You, and You instruct me.’
JOB.42.5	I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear;

JOB.42.6	And I repent in dust and ashes.”
JOB.42.7	It came about after the L
JOB.42.8	Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves, and My servant Job will pray for you. For I will accept him so that I may not do with you

JOB.42.13	He had seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.42.14	He named the first Jemimah, and the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. 
JOB.42.15	In all the land no women were found so fair as Job’s daughters; and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers. 
JOB.42.16	After this, Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons and his grandsons, four generations. 
JOB.42.17	And Job died, an old man and full of days.
PSA.1.1	How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
PSA.1.1	Nor stand in the path of sinners,
PSA.1.1	Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!
PSA.1.2	But his delight is in the law of the L
PSA.1.2	And in His law he meditates day and night.
PSA.1.3	He will be like a tree 
PSA.1.3	Which yields its fruit in its season
PSA.1.3	And its leaf does not wither;
PSA.1.3	And in whatever he does, he prospers.
PSA.1.4	The wicked are not so,

PSA.1.5	Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
PSA.1.5	Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.

PSA.2.2	And the rulers take counsel together
PSA.2.2	Against the L

PSA.2.4	He who

PSA.2.7	“I will surely tell of the decree of the L

PSA.2.10	Now therefore, O kings, show discernment;
PSA.2.10	Take warning, O

PSA.5.3	In the morning I will order 
PSA.5.4	For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness;

PSA.5.5	You hate all who do iniquity.
PSA.5.6	You destroy those who speak falsehood;

PSA.5.9	There is nothing reliable in what they say;

PSA.5.10	By their own devices let them fall!
PSA.5.10	In the multitude of their transgressions thrust them out,

PSA.7.12	If a man does not repent, He will sharpen His sword;
PSA.7.12	He has bent His bow and made it ready.
PSA.7.13	He has also prepared for Himself deadly weapons;
PSA.7.13	He makes His arrows fiery shafts.
PSA.7.14	Behold, he travails with wickedness,
PSA.7.14	And he conceives mischief and brings forth falsehood.
PSA.7.15	He has dug a pit and hollowed it out,

PSA.8.3	The moon and the stars, which You have ordained;
PSA.8.4	What is man that You take thought of him,
PSA.8.4	And the son of man that You care for him?
PSA.8.5	Yet You have made him a little lower than God,
PSA.8.5	And You crown him with glory and majesty!
PSA.8.6	You make him to rule over the works of Your hands;
PSA.8.6	You have put all things under his feet,
PSA.8.7	All sheep and oxen,
PSA.8.7	And also the beasts of the field,
PSA.8.8	The birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea,

PSA.9.13	See my affliction from those who hate me,
PSA.9.13	You who lift me up from the gates of death,
PSA.9.14	That I may tell of all Your praises,
PSA.9.14	That in the gates of the daughter of Zion
PSA.9.14	I may rejoice in Your salvation.
PSA.9.15	The nations have sunk down in the pit which they have made;
PSA.9.15	In the net which they hid, their own foot has been caught.
PSA.9.16	The L
PSA.9.16	He has executed judgment.
PSA.9.16	In the work of his own hands the wicked is snared. Higgaion Selah.
PSA.9.17	The wicked will return to Sheol,

PSA.9.18	Nor the hope of the afflicted perish forever.
PSA.9.19	Arise, O L
PSA.9.19	Let the nations be judged before You.
PSA.9.20	Put them in fear, O L
PSA.9.20	Let the nations know that they are but men. Selah.
PSA.10.1	Why do You stand afar off, O L
PSA.10.1	Why do You hide 
PSA.10.2	In pride the wicked hotly pursue the afflicted;
PSA.10.2	Let them be caught in the plots which they have devised.
PSA.10.3	For the wicked boasts of his heart’s desire,
PSA.10.3	And 
PSA.10.4	The wicked, in the haughtiness of his countenance, does not seek 
PSA.10.4	All his thoughts are, “There is no God.”
PSA.10.5	His ways prosper at all times;
PSA.10.5	Your judgments are on high, out of his sight;
PSA.10.5	As for all his adversaries, he snorts at them.
PSA.10.6	He says to himself, “I will not be moved;
PSA.10.6	Throughout all generations I will not be in adversity.”
PSA.10.7	His mouth is full of curses and deceit and oppression;
PSA.10.7	Under his tongue is mischief and wickedness.
PSA.10.8	He sits in the lurking places of the villages;
PSA.10.8	In the hiding places he kills the innocent;
PSA.10.8	His eyes stealthily watch for the unfortunate.
PSA.10.9	He lurks in a hiding place as a lion in his lair;
PSA.10.9	He lurks to catch the afflicted;
PSA.10.9	He catches the afflicted when he draws him into his net.
PSA.10.10	He crouches, he bows down,
PSA.10.10	And the unfortunate fall 
PSA.10.11	He says to himself, “God has forgotten;
PSA.10.11	He has hidden His face; He will never see it.”
PSA.10.12	Arise, O L
PSA.10.12	Do not forget the afflicted.
PSA.10.13	Why has the wicked spurned God?
PSA.10.13	He has said to himself, “You will not require 
PSA.10.14	You have seen

PSA.17.14	And leave their abundance to their babes.
PSA.17.15	As for me, I shall behold Your face in righteousness;
PSA.17.15	I will be satisfied with Your likeness when I awake.
PSA.18.1	“I love You, O L
PSA.18.2	The L
PSA.18.2	My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge;
PSA.18.2	My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
PSA.18.3	I call upon the L
PSA.18.3	And I am saved from my enemies.
PSA.18.4	The cords of death encompassed me,
PSA.18.4	And the torrents of 
PSA.18.5	The cords of Sheol surrounded me;
PSA.18.5	The snares of death confronted me.
PSA.18.6	In my distress I called upon the L
PSA.18.6	And cried to my God for help;
PSA.18.6	He heard my voice out of His temple,
PSA.18.6	And my cry for help before Him came into His ears.
PSA.18.7	Then the earth shook and quaked;
PSA.18.7	And the foundations of the mountains were trembling
PSA.18.7	And were shaken, because He was angry.
PSA.18.8	Smoke went up out of His nostrils,
PSA.18.8	And fire from His mouth devoured;
PSA.18.8	Coals were kindled by it.
PSA.18.9	He bowed the heavens also, and came down
PSA.18.9	With thick darkness under His feet.
PSA.18.10	He rode upon a cherub and flew;
PSA.18.10	And He sped upon the wings of the wind.
PSA.18.11	He made darkness His hiding place, His canopy around Him,
PSA.18.11	Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
PSA.18.12	From the brightness before Him passed His thick clouds,
PSA.18.12	Hailstones and coals of fire.
PSA.18.13	The L
PSA.18.13	And the Most High uttered His voice,
PSA.18.13	Hailstones and coals of fire.
PSA.18.14	He sent out His arrows, and scattered them,
PSA.18.14	And lightning flashes in abundance, and routed them.
PSA.18.15	Then the channels of water appeared,
PSA.18.15	And the foundations of the world were laid bare
PSA.18.15	At Your rebuke, O L
PSA.18.15	At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
PSA.18.16	He sent from on high, He took me;
PSA.18.16	He drew me out of many waters.
PSA.18.17	He delivered me from my strong enemy,
PSA.18.17	And from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
PSA.18.18	They confronted me in the day of my calamity,
PSA.18.18	But the L
PSA.18.19	He brought me forth also into a broad place;
PSA.18.19	He rescued me, because He delighted in me.
PSA.18.20	The L
PSA.18.20	According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me.
PSA.18.21	For I have kept the ways of the L
PSA.18.21	And have not wickedly departed from my God.
PSA.18.22	For all His ordinances were before me,

PSA.18.25	With the blameless You show Yourself blameless;
PSA.18.26	With the pure You show Yourself pure,
PSA.18.26	And with the crooked You show Yourself

PSA.18.30	As for God, His way is blameless;
PSA.18.30	The word of the L
PSA.18.30	He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.
PSA.18.31	For who is God, but the L
PSA.18.31	And who is a rock, except our God,
PSA.18.32	The God who girds me with strength
PSA.18.32	And makes my way blameless?
PSA.18.33	He makes my feet like hinds’ 
PSA.18.33	And sets me upon my high places.
PSA.18.34	He trains my hands for battle,
PSA.18.34	So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
PSA.18.35	You have also given me the shield of Your salvation,
PSA.18.35	And Your right hand upholds me;
PSA.18.35	And Your gentleness makes me great.
PSA.18.36	You enlarge my steps under me,
PSA.18.36	And my feet have not slipped.
PSA.18.37	I pursued my enemies and overtook them,
PSA.18.37	And I did not turn back until they were consumed.
PSA.18.38	I shattered them, so that they were not able to rise;
PSA.18.38	They fell under my feet.
PSA.18.39	For You have girded me with strength for battle;
PSA.18.39	You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
PSA.18.40	You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,
PSA.18.40	And I 
PSA.18.41	They cried for help, but there was none to save,
PSA.18.42	Then I beat them fine as the dust before the wind;
PSA.18.42	I emptied them out as the mire of the streets.
PSA.18.43	You have delivered me from the contentions of the people;
PSA.18.43	You have placed me as head of the nations;
PSA.18.43	A people whom I have not known serve me.
PSA.18.44	As soon as they hear, they obey me;
PSA.18.44	Foreigners 
PSA.18.45	Foreigners fade away,
PSA.18.45	And come trembling out of their fortresses.
PSA.18.46	The L
PSA.18.46	And exalted be the God of my salvation,
PSA.18.47	The God who executes vengeance for me,
PSA.18.47	And subdues peoples under me.
PSA.18.48	He delivers me from my enemies;
PSA.18.48	Surely You lift me above those who rise up against me;

PSA.22.1	Far from my deliverance are the words of my groaning.
PSA.22.2	O my God, I cry by day, but You do not answer;

PSA.22.4	They trusted and You delivered them.
PSA.22.5	To You they cried out and were delivered;
PSA.22.5	In You they trusted and were not disappointed.
PSA.22.6	But I am a worm and not a man,
PSA.22.6	A reproach of men and despised by the people.
PSA.22.7	All who see me sneer at me;
PSA.22.7	They

PSA.22.15	My strength is dried up like a potsherd,
PSA.22.15	And my tongue cleaves to my jaws;

PSA.27.11	And lead me in a level path
PSA.27.11	Because of my foes.
PSA.27.12	Do not deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries,

PSA.28.1	My rock, do not be deaf to me,

PSA.28.5	Because they do not regard the works of the L
PSA.28.5	Nor the deeds of His hands,
PSA.28.5	He will tear them down and not build them up.
PSA.28.6	Blessed be the L
PSA.28.6	Because He has heard the voice of my supplication.
PSA.28.7	The L
PSA.28.7	My heart trusts in Him, and I am helped;
PSA.28.7	Therefore my heart exults,
PSA.28.7	And with my song I shall thank Him.

PSA.30.9	Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your faithfulness?
PSA.30.10	“Hear, O L

PSA.30.11	You have turned for me my mourning into dancing;
PSA.30.11	You have loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness,

PSA.31.2	Be to me a rock of strength,
PSA.31.2	A stronghold to save me.
PSA.31.3	For You are my rock and my fortress;
PSA.31.3	For Your name’s sake You will lead me and guide me.
PSA.31.4	You will pull me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me,
PSA.31.4	For You are my strength.
PSA.31.5	Into Your hand I commit my spirit;
PSA.31.5	You have ransomed me, O L
PSA.31.6	I hate those who regard vain idols,
PSA.31.6	But I trust in the L
PSA.31.7	I will rejoice and be glad in Your lovingkindness,
PSA.31.7	Because You have seen my affliction;
PSA.31.7	You have known the troubles of my soul,
PSA.31.8	And You have not given me over into the hand of the enemy;
PSA.31.8	You have set my feet in a large place.
PSA.31.9	Be gracious to me, O L
PSA.31.9	My eye is wasted away from grief, my soul and my body 
PSA.31.10	For my life is spent with sorrow
PSA.31.10	And my years with sighing;
PSA.31.10	My strength has failed because of my iniquity,
PSA.31.10	And my body has wasted away.
PSA.31.11	Because of all my adversaries, I have become a reproach,
PSA.31.11	Especially to my neighbors,
PSA.31.11	And an object of dread to my acquaintances;
PSA.31.11	Those who see me in the street flee from me.
PSA.31.12	I am forgotten as a dead man, out of mind;
PSA.31.12	I am like a broken vessel.
PSA.31.13	For I have heard the slander of many,
PSA.31.13	Terror is on every side;
PSA.31.13	While they took counsel together against me,
PSA.31.13	They schemed to take away my life.
PSA.31.14	But as for me, I trust in You, O L
PSA.31.14	I say, “You are my God.”
PSA.31.15	My times are in Your hand;
PSA.31.15	Deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from those who persecute me.
PSA.31.16	Make Your face to shine upon Your servant;
PSA.31.16	Save me in Your lovingkindness.
PSA.31.17	Let me not be put to shame, O L
PSA.31.17	Let the wicked be put to shame, let them be silent in Sheol.
PSA.31.18	Let the lying lips be mute,
PSA.31.18	Which speak arrogantly against the righteous
PSA.31.18	With pride and contempt.
PSA.31.19	How great is Your goodness,
PSA.31.19	Which You have stored up for those who fear You,
PSA.31.19	Which You have wrought for those who take refuge in You,
PSA.31.19	Before the sons of men!
PSA.31.20	You hide them in the secret place of Your presence from the conspiracies of man;
PSA.31.20	You keep them secretly in a shelter from the strife of tongues.
PSA.31.21	Blessed be the L
PSA.31.21	For He has made marvelous His lovingkindness to me in a besieged city.
PSA.31.22	As for me, I said in my alarm,
PSA.31.22	“I am cut off from before Your eyes”;
PSA.31.22	Nevertheless You heard the voice of my supplications
PSA.31.22	When I cried to You.
PSA.31.23	O love the L
PSA.31.23	The L
PSA.31.23	And fully recompenses the proud doer.
PSA.31.24	Be strong and let your heart take courage,

PSA.32.1	Whose sin is covered!
PSA.32.2	How blessed is the man to whom the L
PSA.32.2	And in whose spirit there is no deceit!
PSA.32.3	When I kept silent 
PSA.32.3	Through my groaning all day long.
PSA.32.4	For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me;
PSA.32.4	My vitality was drained away 
PSA.32.5	I acknowledged my sin to You,
PSA.32.5	And my iniquity I did not hide;
PSA.32.5	I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the L
PSA.32.5	And You forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah.
PSA.32.6	Therefore, let everyone who is godly pray to You in a time when You may be found;
PSA.32.6	Surely in a flood of great waters they will not reach him.
PSA.32.7	You are my hiding place; You preserve me from trouble;
PSA.32.7	You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah.
PSA.32.8	I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go;
PSA.32.8	I will counsel you with My eye upon you.
PSA.32.9	Do not be as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding,
PSA.32.9	Whose trappings include bit and bridle to hold them in check,
PSA.32.10	Many are the sorrows of the wicked,
PSA.32.10	But he who trusts in the L
PSA.32.11	Be glad in the L
PSA.32.11	And shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart.
PSA.33.1	Sing for joy in the L
PSA.33.1	Praise is becoming to the upright.
PSA.33.2	Give thanks to the L
PSA.33.2	Sing praises to Him with a harp of ten strings.
PSA.33.3	Sing to Him a new song;
PSA.33.3	Play skillfully with a shout of joy.
PSA.33.4	For the word of the L
PSA.33.4	And all His work is 
PSA.33.5	He loves righteousness and justice;
PSA.33.5	The earth is full of the lovingkindness of the L
PSA.33.6	By the word of the L
PSA.33.6	And by the breath of His mouth all their host.
PSA.33.7	He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap;
PSA.33.7	He lays up the deeps in storehouses.
PSA.33.8	Let all the earth fear the L
PSA.33.8	Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.
PSA.33.9	For He spoke, and it was done;
PSA.33.9	He commanded, and it stood fast.
PSA.33.10	The L
PSA.33.10	He frustrates the plans of the peoples.
PSA.33.11	The counsel of the L
PSA.33.11	The plans of His heart from generation to generation.
PSA.33.12	Blessed is the nation whose God is the L
PSA.33.12	The people whom He has chosen for His own inheritance.
PSA.33.13	The L
PSA.33.13	He sees all the sons of men;
PSA.33.14	From His dwelling place He looks out
PSA.33.14	On all the inhabitants of the earth,
PSA.33.15	He who fashions the hearts of them all,
PSA.33.15	He who understands all their works.
PSA.33.16	The king is not saved by a mighty army;
PSA.33.16	A warrior is not delivered by great strength.
PSA.33.17	A horse is a false hope for victory;
PSA.33.17	Nor does it deliver anyone by its great strength.
PSA.33.18	Behold, the eye of the L
PSA.33.18	On those who hope for His lovingkindness,
PSA.33.19	To deliver their soul from death
PSA.33.19	And to keep them alive in famine.
PSA.33.20	Our soul waits for the L
PSA.33.20	He is our help and our shield.
PSA.33.21	For our heart rejoices in Him,
PSA.33.21	Because we trust in His holy name.
PSA.33.22	Let Your lovingkindness, O L
PSA.33.22	According as we have hoped in You.
PSA.34.1	I will bless the L
PSA.34.1	His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
PSA.34.2	My soul will make its boast in the L
PSA.34.2	The humble will hear it and rejoice.
PSA.34.3	O magnify the L
PSA.34.3	And let us exalt His name together.
PSA.34.4	I sought the L
PSA.34.4	And delivered me from all my fears.
PSA.34.5	They looked to Him and were radiant,
PSA.34.5	And their faces will never be ashamed.
PSA.34.6	This poor man cried, and the L
PSA.34.6	And saved him out of all his troubles.
PSA.34.7	The angel of the L
PSA.34.7	And rescues them.
PSA.34.8	O taste and see that the L
PSA.34.8	How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!
PSA.34.9	O fear the L
PSA.34.9	For to those who fear Him there is no want.
PSA.34.10	The young lions do lack and suffer hunger;
PSA.34.10	But they who seek the L
PSA.34.11	Come, you children, listen to me;
PSA.34.11	I will teach you the fear of the L
PSA.34.12	Who is the man who desires life
PSA.34.12	And loves 
PSA.34.13	Keep your tongue from evil
PSA.34.13	And your lips from speaking deceit.
PSA.34.14	Depart from evil and do good;
PSA.34.14	Seek peace and pursue it.
PSA.34.15	The eyes of the L
PSA.34.15	And His ears are 
PSA.34.16	The face of the L
PSA.34.16	To cut off the memory of them from the earth.
PSA.34.17	And delivers them out of all their troubles.
PSA.34.18	The L
PSA.34.18	And saves those who are 
PSA.34.19	Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
PSA.34.19	But the L
PSA.34.20	He keeps all his bones,
PSA.34.20	Not one of them is broken.
PSA.34.21	Evil shall slay the wicked,
PSA.34.21	And those who hate the righteous will be condemned.
PSA.34.22	The L
PSA.34.22	And none of those who take refuge in Him will be condemned.
PSA.35.1	Contend, O L
PSA.35.1	Fight against those who fight against me.
PSA.35.2	Take hold of 
PSA.35.2	And rise up for my help.
PSA.35.3	Draw also the spear and the battle-axe to meet those who pursue me;
PSA.35.3	Say to my soul, “I am your salvation.”
PSA.35.4	Let those be ashamed and dishonored who seek my life;
PSA.35.4	Let those be turned back and humiliated who devise evil against me.
PSA.35.5	Let them be like chaff before the wind,
PSA.35.5	With the angel of the L
PSA.35.6	Let their way be dark and slippery,
PSA.35.6	With the angel of the L
PSA.35.7	For without cause they hid their net for me;
PSA.35.7	Without cause they dug a pit for my soul.
PSA.35.8	Let destruction come upon him unawares,
PSA.35.8	And let the net which he hid catch himself;
PSA.35.8	Into that very destruction let him fall.
PSA.35.9	And my soul shall rejoice in the L
PSA.35.9	It shall exult in His salvation.
PSA.35.10	All my bones will say, “L
PSA.35.10	Who delivers the afflicted from him who is too strong for him,
PSA.35.10	And the afflicted and the needy from him who robs him?”
PSA.35.11	Malicious witnesses rise up;
PSA.35.11	They ask me of things that I do not know.
PSA.35.12	They repay me evil for good,
PSA.35.13	But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth;
PSA.35.13	I humbled my soul with fasting,
PSA.35.13	And my prayer kept returning to my bosom.
PSA.35.14	I went about as though it were my friend or brother;
PSA.35.14	I bowed down mourning, as one who sorrows for a mother.
PSA.35.15	But at my 
PSA.35.15	The smiters whom I did not know gathered together against me,
PSA.35.15	They slandered me without ceasing.
PSA.35.16	Like godless jesters at a feast,
PSA.35.16	They gnashed at me with their teeth.
PSA.35.17	Lord, how long will You look on?
PSA.35.17	Rescue my soul from their ravages,
PSA.35.17	My only 
PSA.35.18	I will give You thanks in the great congregation;
PSA.35.18	I will praise You among a mighty throng.
PSA.35.19	Do not let those who are wrongfully my enemies rejoice over me;
PSA.35.19	Nor let those who hate me without cause wink maliciously.
PSA.35.20	For they do not speak peace,
PSA.35.20	But they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.
PSA.35.21	They opened their mouth wide against me;
PSA.35.21	They said, “Aha, aha, our eyes have seen it!”
PSA.35.22	You have seen it, O L
PSA.35.22	O Lord, do not be far from me.
PSA.35.23	Stir up Yourself, and awake to my right
PSA.35.23	And to my cause, my God and my Lord.
PSA.35.24	Judge me, O L
PSA.35.24	And do not let them rejoice over me.
PSA.35.25	Do not let them say in their heart, “Aha, our desire!”
PSA.35.25	Do not let them say, “We have swallowed him up!”
PSA.35.26	Let those be ashamed and humiliated altogether who rejoice at my distress;
PSA.35.26	Let those be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves over me.
PSA.35.27	Let them shout for joy and rejoice, who favor my vindication;
PSA.35.27	And let them say continually, “The L
PSA.35.27	Who delights in the prosperity of His servant.”
PSA.35.28	And my tongue shall declare Your righteousness
PSA.36.1	Transgression speaks to the ungodly within his heart;
PSA.36.1	There is no fear of God before his eyes.
PSA.36.2	For it flatters him in his 
PSA.36.2	Concerning the discovery of his iniquity 
PSA.36.3	The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit;
PSA.36.3	He has ceased to be wise 
PSA.36.4	He plans wickedness upon his bed;
PSA.36.4	He sets himself on a path that is not good;
PSA.36.4	He does not despise evil.
PSA.36.5	Your lovingkindness, O L
PSA.36.5	Your faithfulness 
PSA.36.6	Your righteousness is like the mountains of God;
PSA.36.6	Your judgments are 
PSA.36.6	O L
PSA.36.7	How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God!
PSA.36.7	And the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.
PSA.36.8	They drink their fill of the abundance of Your house;
PSA.36.8	And You give them to drink of the river of Your delights.
PSA.36.9	For with You is the fountain of life;
PSA.36.9	In Your light we see light.
PSA.36.10	O continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You,
PSA.36.10	And Your righteousness to the upright in heart.
PSA.36.11	Let not the foot of pride come upon me,
PSA.36.11	And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.
PSA.36.12	There the doers of iniquity have fallen;
PSA.36.12	They have been thrust down and cannot rise.
PSA.37.1	Do not fret because of evildoers,
PSA.37.1	Be not envious toward wrongdoers.
PSA.37.2	For they will wither quickly like the grass
PSA.37.2	And fade like the green herb.
PSA.37.3	Trust in the L
PSA.37.3	Dwell in the land and 
PSA.37.4	Delight yourself in the L
PSA.37.4	And He will give you the desires of your heart.
PSA.37.5	Commit your way to the L
PSA.37.5	Trust also in Him, and He will do it.
PSA.37.6	He will bring forth your righteousness as the light
PSA.37.6	And your judgment as the noonday.
PSA.37.7	Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way,
PSA.37.7	Because of the man who carries out wicked schemes.
PSA.37.8	Cease from anger and forsake wrath;
PSA.37.8	Do not fret; 
PSA.37.9	For evildoers will be cut off,
PSA.37.9	But those who wait for the L
PSA.37.10	Yet a little while and the wicked man will be no more;
PSA.37.10	And you will look carefully for his place and he will not be 
PSA.37.11	But the humble will inherit the land
PSA.37.11	And will delight themselves in abundant prosperity.
PSA.37.12	The wicked plots against the righteous
PSA.37.12	And gnashes at him with his teeth.
PSA.37.13	The Lord laughs at him,
PSA.37.13	For He sees his day is coming.
PSA.37.14	The wicked have drawn the sword and bent their bow
PSA.37.14	To cast down the afflicted and the needy,
PSA.37.14	To slay those who are upright in conduct.
PSA.37.15	Their sword will enter their own heart,
PSA.37.15	And their bows will be broken.
PSA.37.16	Better is the little of the righteous
PSA.37.16	Than the abundance of many wicked.
PSA.37.17	For the arms of the wicked will be broken,
PSA.37.17	But the L
PSA.37.18	The L
PSA.37.18	And their inheritance will be forever.
PSA.37.19	They will not be ashamed in the time of evil,
PSA.37.19	And in the days of famine they will have abundance.
PSA.37.20	But the wicked will perish;
PSA.37.20	And the enemies of the L
PSA.37.20	They vanish—like smoke they vanish away.
PSA.37.21	The wicked borrows and does not pay back,
PSA.37.21	But the righteous is gracious and gives.
PSA.37.22	For those blessed by Him will inherit the land,
PSA.37.22	But those cursed by Him will be cut off.
PSA.37.23	The steps of a man are established by the L
PSA.37.23	And He delights in his way.
PSA.37.24	When he falls, he will not be hurled headlong,
PSA.37.24	Because the L
PSA.37.25	I have been young and now I am old,
PSA.37.25	Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken
PSA.37.25	Or his descendants begging bread.
PSA.37.26	All day long he is gracious and lends,
PSA.37.26	And his descendants are a blessing.
PSA.37.27	Depart from evil and do good,
PSA.37.27	So you will abide forever.
PSA.37.28	For the L
PSA.37.28	And does not forsake His godly ones;
PSA.37.28	They are preserved forever,
PSA.37.28	But the descendants of the wicked will be cut off.
PSA.37.29	The righteous will inherit the land
PSA.37.29	And dwell in it forever.
PSA.37.30	The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom,
PSA.37.30	And his tongue speaks justice.
PSA.37.31	The law of his God is in his heart;
PSA.37.31	His steps do not slip.
PSA.37.32	The wicked spies upon the righteous
PSA.37.32	And seeks to kill him.
PSA.37.33	The L
PSA.37.33	Or let him be condemned when he is judged.
PSA.37.34	Wait for the L
PSA.37.34	And He will exalt you to inherit the land;
PSA.37.34	When the wicked are cut off, you will see it.
PSA.37.35	I have seen a wicked, violent man
PSA.37.35	Spreading himself like a luxuriant tree in its native soil.
PSA.37.36	Then he passed away, and lo, he was no more;
PSA.37.36	I sought for him, but he could not be found.
PSA.37.37	Mark the blameless man, and behold the upright;
PSA.37.37	For the man of peace will have a posterity.
PSA.37.38	But transgressors will be altogether destroyed;
PSA.37.38	The posterity of the wicked will be cut off.
PSA.37.39	But the salvation of the righteous is from the L
PSA.37.39	He is their strength in time of trouble.
PSA.37.40	The L
PSA.37.40	He delivers them from the wicked and saves them,
PSA.37.40	Because they take refuge in Him.
PSA.38.1	O L
PSA.38.1	And chasten me not in Your burning anger.
PSA.38.2	For Your arrows have sunk deep into me,
PSA.38.2	And Your hand has pressed down on me.
PSA.38.3	There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your indignation;
PSA.38.3	There is no health in my bones because of my sin.
PSA.38.4	For my iniquities are gone over my head;
PSA.38.4	As a heavy burden they weigh too much for me.
PSA.38.5	My wounds grow foul 
PSA.38.5	Because of my folly.
PSA.38.6	I am bent over and greatly bowed down;
PSA.38.6	I go mourning all day long.
PSA.38.7	For my loins are filled with burning,
PSA.38.7	And there is no soundness in my flesh.
PSA.38.8	I am benumbed and badly crushed;
PSA.38.8	I groan because of the agitation of my heart.
PSA.38.9	Lord, all my desire is before You;
PSA.38.9	And my sighing is not hidden from You.
PSA.38.10	My heart throbs, my strength fails me;
PSA.38.10	And the light of my eyes, even that has gone from me.
PSA.38.11	My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my plague;
PSA.38.11	And my kinsmen stand afar off.
PSA.38.12	Those who seek my life lay snares 
PSA.38.12	And those who seek to injure me have threatened destruction,
PSA.38.12	And they devise treachery all day long.
PSA.38.13	But I, like a deaf man, do not hear;
PSA.38.13	And 
PSA.38.14	Yes, I am like a man who does not hear,
PSA.38.14	And in whose mouth are no arguments.
PSA.38.15	For I hope in You, O L
PSA.38.15	You will answer, O Lord my God.
PSA.38.16	For I said, “May they not rejoice over me,
PSA.38.17	For I am ready to fall,
PSA.38.17	And my 
PSA.38.18	For I confess my iniquity;
PSA.38.18	I am full of anxiety because of my sin.
PSA.38.19	But my enemies are vigorous 
PSA.38.19	And many are those who hate me wrongfully.
PSA.38.20	And those who repay evil for good,
PSA.38.20	They oppose me, because I follow what is good.
PSA.38.21	Do not forsake me, O L
PSA.38.21	O my God, do not be far from me!
PSA.38.22	Make haste to help me,
PSA.38.22	O Lord, my salvation!
PSA.39.1	I said, “I will guard my ways
PSA.39.1	That I may not sin with my tongue;
PSA.39.1	I will guard my mouth as with a muzzle
PSA.39.1	While the wicked are in my presence.”
PSA.39.2	I was mute and silent,
PSA.39.2	I 
PSA.39.2	And my 
PSA.39.3	My heart was hot within me,
PSA.39.3	While I was musing the fire burned;
PSA.39.4	“L
PSA.39.4	And what is the extent of my days;
PSA.39.4	Let me know how transient I am.
PSA.39.5	Behold, You have made my days 
PSA.39.5	And my lifetime as nothing in Your sight;
PSA.39.5	Surely every man at his best is a mere breath. Selah.
PSA.39.6	Surely every man walks about as 
PSA.39.6	Surely they make an uproar for nothing;
PSA.39.6	He amasses 
PSA.39.7	“And now, Lord, for what do I wait?
PSA.39.7	My hope is in You.
PSA.39.8	Deliver me from all my transgressions;
PSA.39.8	Make me not the reproach of the foolish.
PSA.39.9	I have become mute, I do not open my mouth,
PSA.39.9	Because it is You who have done 
PSA.39.10	Remove Your plague from me;
PSA.39.10	Because of the opposition of Your hand I am perishing.
PSA.39.11	With reproofs You chasten a man for iniquity;
PSA.39.11	You consume as a moth what is precious to him;
PSA.39.11	Surely every man is a mere breath. Selah.
PSA.39.12	“Hear my prayer, O L
PSA.39.12	Do not be silent at my tears;
PSA.39.12	For I am a stranger with You,
PSA.39.12	A sojourner like all my fathers.
PSA.39.13	Turn Your gaze away from me, that I may 
PSA.39.13	Before I depart and am no more.”
PSA.40.1	I waited 
PSA.40.1	And He inclined to me and heard my cry.
PSA.40.2	He brought me up out of the pit of destruction, out of the miry clay,
PSA.40.2	And He set my feet upon a rock making my footsteps firm.
PSA.40.3	He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God;
PSA.40.3	Many will see and fear
PSA.40.3	And will trust in the L
PSA.40.4	How blessed is the man who has made the L
PSA.40.4	And has not turned to the proud, nor to those who lapse into falsehood.
PSA.40.5	Many, O L
PSA.40.5	And Your thoughts toward us;
PSA.40.5	There is none to compare with You.
PSA.40.5	If I would declare and speak of them,
PSA.40.5	They would be too numerous to count.
PSA.40.6	Sacrifice and meal offering You have not desired;
PSA.40.6	My ears You have 
PSA.40.6	Burnt offering and sin offering You have not required.
PSA.40.7	Then I said, “Behold, I come;
PSA.40.7	In the scroll of the book it is written of me.
PSA.40.8	I delight to do Your will, O my God;
PSA.40.8	Your Law is within my heart.”
PSA.40.9	I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great congregation;
PSA.40.9	Behold, I will not restrain my lips,
PSA.40.9	O L
PSA.40.10	I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart;
PSA.40.10	I have spoken of Your faithfulness and Your salvation;
PSA.40.10	I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth from the great congregation.
PSA.40.11	You, O L
PSA.40.11	Your lovingkindness and Your truth will continually preserve me.
PSA.40.12	For evils beyond number have surrounded me;
PSA.40.12	My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to see;
PSA.40.12	They are more numerous than the hairs of my head,
PSA.40.12	And my heart has failed me.
PSA.40.13	Be pleased, O L
PSA.40.13	Make haste, O L
PSA.40.14	Let those be ashamed and humiliated together
PSA.40.14	Who seek my 
PSA.40.14	Let those be turned back and dishonored
PSA.40.14	Who delight 
PSA.40.15	Let those be appalled because of their shame
PSA.40.15	Who say to me, “Aha, aha!”
PSA.40.16	Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You;
PSA.40.16	Let those who love Your salvation say continually,
PSA.40.16	“The L
PSA.40.17	Since I am afflicted and needy,
PSA.40.17	Let the Lord be mindful of me.
PSA.40.17	You are my help and my deliverer;
PSA.40.17	Do not delay, O my God.
PSA.41.1	How blessed is he who considers the helpless;
PSA.41.1	The L
PSA.41.2	The L
PSA.41.2	And he shall be called blessed upon the earth;
PSA.41.2	And do not give him over to the desire of his enemies.
PSA.41.3	The L
PSA.41.3	In his illness, You 
PSA.41.4	As for me, I said, “O L
PSA.41.4	Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You.”
PSA.41.5	My enemies speak evil against me,
PSA.41.5	“When will he die, and his name perish?”
PSA.41.6	And when he comes to see 
PSA.41.6	His heart gathers wickedness to itself;
PSA.41.6	When he goes outside, he tells it.
PSA.41.7	All who hate me whisper together against me;
PSA.41.7	Against me they devise my hurt, 
PSA.41.8	“A wicked thing is poured out upon him,
PSA.41.8	That when he lies down, he will not rise up again.”
PSA.41.9	Even my close friend in whom I trusted,
PSA.41.9	Who ate my bread,
PSA.41.9	Has lifted up his heel against me.
PSA.41.10	But You, O L
PSA.41.10	That I may repay them.
PSA.41.11	By this I know that You are pleased with me,
PSA.41.11	Because my enemy does not shout in triumph over me.
PSA.41.12	As for me, You uphold me in my integrity,
PSA.41.12	And You set me in Your presence forever.
PSA.41.13	Blessed be the L
PSA.41.13	From everlasting to everlasting.
PSA.41.13	Amen and Amen.
PSA.42.1	As the deer 
PSA.42.1	So my soul pants for You, O God.
PSA.42.2	My soul thirsts for God, for the living God;
PSA.42.2	When shall I come and appear before God?
PSA.42.3	My tears have been my food day and night,
PSA.42.3	While 
PSA.42.4	These things I remember and I pour out my soul within me.
PSA.42.4	For I used to go along with the throng 
PSA.42.4	With the voice of joy and thanksgiving, a multitude keeping festival.
PSA.42.5	Why are you in despair, O my soul?
PSA.42.5	And 
PSA.42.5	Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him
PSA.42.6	O my God, my soul is in despair within me;
PSA.42.6	Therefore I remember You from the land of the Jordan
PSA.42.6	And the peaks of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
PSA.42.7	Deep calls to deep at the sound of Your waterfalls;
PSA.42.7	All Your breakers and Your waves have rolled over me.
PSA.42.8	The L
PSA.42.8	And His song will be with me in the night,
PSA.42.8	A prayer to the God of my life.
PSA.42.9	I will say to God my rock, “Why have You forgotten me?
PSA.42.9	Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”
PSA.42.10	As a shattering of my bones, my adversaries revile me,
PSA.42.10	While they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”
PSA.42.11	Why are you in despair, O my soul?
PSA.42.11	And why have you become disturbed within me?
PSA.42.11	Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him,
PSA.42.11	The help of my countenance and my God.
PSA.43.1	Vindicate me, O God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation;
PSA.43.1	O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man!
PSA.43.2	For You are the God of my strength; why have You rejected me?
PSA.43.2	Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
PSA.43.3	O send out Your light and Your truth, let them lead me;
PSA.43.3	Let them bring me to Your holy hill
PSA.43.3	And to Your dwelling places.
PSA.43.4	Then I will go to the altar of God,
PSA.43.4	To God my exceeding joy;
PSA.43.4	And upon the lyre I shall praise You, O God, my God.
PSA.43.5	Why are you in despair, O my soul?
PSA.43.5	And why are you disturbed within me?
PSA.43.5	Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him,
PSA.43.5	The help of my countenance and my God.
PSA.44.1	O God, we have heard with our ears,
PSA.44.1	Our fathers have told us
PSA.44.1	The work that You did in their days,
PSA.44.1	In the days of old.
PSA.44.2	You with Your own hand drove out the nations;
PSA.44.2	Then You planted them;
PSA.44.2	You afflicted the peoples,
PSA.44.2	Then You spread them abroad.
PSA.44.3	For by their own sword they did not possess the land,
PSA.44.3	And their own arm did not save them,
PSA.44.3	But Your right hand and Your arm and the light of Your presence,
PSA.44.3	For You favored them.
PSA.44.4	You are my King, O God;
PSA.44.4	Command victories for Jacob.
PSA.44.5	Through You we will push back our adversaries;
PSA.44.5	Through Your name we will trample down those who rise up against us.
PSA.44.6	For I will not trust in my bow,
PSA.44.6	Nor will my sword save me.
PSA.44.7	But You have saved us from our adversaries,
PSA.44.7	And You have put to shame those who hate us.
PSA.44.8	In God we have boasted all day long,
PSA.44.8	And we will give thanks to Your name forever. Selah.
PSA.44.9	Yet You have rejected 
PSA.44.9	And do not go out with our armies.
PSA.44.10	You cause us to turn back from the adversary;
PSA.44.10	And those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves.
PSA.44.11	You give us as sheep to be eaten
PSA.44.11	And have scattered us among the nations.
PSA.44.12	You sell Your people cheaply,
PSA.44.12	And have not 
PSA.44.13	You make us a reproach to our neighbors,
PSA.44.13	A scoffing and a derision to those around us.
PSA.44.14	You make us a byword among the nations,
PSA.44.14	A laughingstock among the peoples.
PSA.44.15	All day long my dishonor is before me
PSA.44.15	And my humiliation has overwhelmed me,
PSA.44.16	Because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles,
PSA.44.16	Because of the presence of the enemy and the avenger.
PSA.44.17	All this has come upon us, but we have not forgotten You,
PSA.44.17	And we have not dealt falsely with Your covenant.
PSA.44.18	Our heart has not turned back,
PSA.44.18	And our steps have not deviated from Your way,
PSA.44.19	Yet You have crushed us in a place of jackals
PSA.44.19	And covered us with the shadow of death.
PSA.44.20	If we had forgotten the name of our God
PSA.44.20	Or extended our hands to a strange god,
PSA.44.21	Would not God find this out?
PSA.44.21	For He knows the secrets of the heart.
PSA.44.22	But for Your sake we are killed all day long;
PSA.44.22	We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
PSA.44.23	Arouse Yourself, why do You sleep, O Lord?
PSA.44.23	Awake, do not reject us forever.
PSA.44.24	Why do You hide Your face
PSA.44.25	For our soul has sunk down into the dust;
PSA.44.25	Our body cleaves to the earth.
PSA.44.26	Rise up, be our help,
PSA.44.26	And redeem us for the sake of Your lovingkindness.
PSA.45.1	My heart 
PSA.45.1	I address my verses to the King;
PSA.45.1	My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
PSA.45.2	You are fairer than the sons of men;
PSA.45.2	Grace is poured upon Your lips;
PSA.45.2	Therefore God has blessed You forever.
PSA.45.3	Gird Your sword on 
PSA.45.4	And in Your majesty ride on victoriously,
PSA.45.4	For the cause of truth and meekness 
PSA.45.4	Let Your right hand teach You awesome things.
PSA.45.5	Your arrows are sharp;
PSA.45.5	The peoples fall under You;
PSA.45.6	Your throne, O God, is forever and ever;
PSA.45.6	A scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.
PSA.45.7	You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;
PSA.45.7	Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You
PSA.45.7	With the oil of joy above Your fellows.
PSA.45.8	All Your garments are 
PSA.45.8	Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made You glad.
PSA.45.9	Kings’ daughters are among Your noble ladies;
PSA.45.9	At Your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir.
PSA.45.10	Listen, O daughter, give attention and incline your ear:
PSA.45.10	Forget your people and your father’s house;
PSA.45.11	Then the King will desire your beauty.
PSA.45.11	Because He is your Lord, bow down to Him.
PSA.45.12	The daughter of Tyre 
PSA.45.12	The rich among the people will seek your favor.
PSA.45.13	The King’s daughter is all glorious within;
PSA.45.13	Her clothing is interwoven with gold.
PSA.45.14	She will be led to the King in embroidered work;
PSA.45.14	The virgins, her companions who follow her,
PSA.45.14	Will be brought to You.
PSA.45.15	They will be led forth with gladness and rejoicing;
PSA.45.15	They will enter into the King’s palace.
PSA.45.16	In place of your fathers will be your sons;
PSA.45.16	You shall make them princes in all the earth.
PSA.45.17	I will cause Your name to be remembered in all generations;
PSA.45.17	Therefore the peoples will give You thanks forever and ever.
PSA.46.1	God is our refuge and strength,
PSA.46.2	Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change
PSA.46.2	And though the mountains slip into the heart of the sea;
PSA.46.3	Though its waters roar 
PSA.46.3	Though the mountains quake at its swelling pride. Selah.
PSA.46.4	There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,
PSA.46.4	The holy dwelling places of the Most High.
PSA.46.5	God is in the midst of her, she will not be moved;
PSA.46.5	God will help her when morning dawns.
PSA.46.6	The nations made an uproar, the kingdoms tottered;
PSA.46.6	He raised His voice, the earth melted.
PSA.46.7	The L
PSA.46.7	The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah.
PSA.46.8	Come, behold the works of the L
PSA.46.8	Who has wrought desolations in the earth.
PSA.46.9	He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth;
PSA.46.9	He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two;
PSA.46.9	He burns the chariots with fire.
PSA.46.10	“Cease 
PSA.46.10	I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.”
PSA.46.11	The L
PSA.46.11	The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah.
PSA.47.1	O clap your hands, all peoples;
PSA.47.1	Shout to God with the voice of joy.
PSA.47.2	For the L
PSA.47.2	A great King over all the earth.
PSA.47.3	He subdues peoples under us
PSA.47.3	And nations under our feet.
PSA.47.4	He chooses our inheritance for us,
PSA.47.4	The glory of Jacob whom He loves. Selah.
PSA.47.5	God has ascended with a shout,
PSA.47.5	The L
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to God, sing praises;
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to our King, sing praises.
PSA.47.7	For God is the King of all the earth;
PSA.47.7	Sing praises with a skillful psalm.
PSA.47.8	God reigns over the nations,
PSA.47.8	God sits on His holy throne.
PSA.47.9	The princes of the people have assembled themselves 
PSA.47.9	For the shields of the earth belong to God;
PSA.47.9	He is highly exalted.
PSA.48.1	Great is the L
PSA.48.1	In the city of our God, His holy mountain.
PSA.48.2	Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth,
PSA.48.2	Is Mount Zion 
PSA.48.2	The city of the great King.
PSA.48.3	God, in her palaces,
PSA.48.3	Has made Himself known as a stronghold.
PSA.48.4	For, lo, the kings assembled themselves,
PSA.48.4	They passed by together.
PSA.48.5	They saw 
PSA.48.5	They were terrified, they fled in alarm.
PSA.48.6	Panic seized them there,
PSA.48.6	Anguish, as of a woman in childbirth.
PSA.48.7	With the east wind
PSA.48.7	You break the ships of Tarshish.
PSA.48.8	As we have heard, so have we seen
PSA.48.8	In the city of the L
PSA.48.8	God will establish her forever. Selah.
PSA.48.9	We have thought on Your lovingkindness, O God,
PSA.48.9	In the midst of Your temple.
PSA.48.10	As is Your name, O God,
PSA.48.10	So is Your praise to the ends of the earth;
PSA.48.10	Your right hand is full of righteousness.
PSA.48.11	Let Mount Zion be glad,
PSA.48.11	Let the daughters of Judah rejoice
PSA.48.11	Because of Your judgments.
PSA.48.12	Walk about Zion and go around her;
PSA.48.12	Count her towers;
PSA.48.13	Consider her ramparts;
PSA.48.13	Go through her palaces,
PSA.48.13	That you may tell 
PSA.48.14	For such is God,
PSA.48.14	Our God forever and ever;
PSA.48.14	He will guide us 
PSA.49.1	Hear this, all peoples;
PSA.49.1	Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,
PSA.49.2	Both low and high,
PSA.49.2	Rich and poor together.
PSA.49.3	My mouth will speak wisdom,
PSA.49.3	And the meditation of my heart 
PSA.49.4	I will incline my ear to a proverb;
PSA.49.4	I will express my riddle on the harp.
PSA.49.5	Why should I fear in days of adversity,
PSA.49.5	When the iniquity of my foes surrounds me,
PSA.49.6	Even those who trust in their wealth
PSA.49.6	And boast in the abundance of their riches?
PSA.49.7	No man can by any means redeem 
PSA.49.7	Or give to God a ransom for him—
PSA.49.8	For the redemption of his soul is costly,
PSA.49.8	And he should cease 
PSA.49.9	That he should live on eternally,
PSA.49.9	That he should not 
PSA.49.10	For he sees 
PSA.49.10	The stupid and the senseless alike perish
PSA.49.10	And leave their wealth to others.
PSA.49.11	Their 
PSA.49.11	They have called their lands after their own names.
PSA.49.12	But man in 
PSA.49.12	He is like the beasts that perish.
PSA.49.13	This is the way of those who are foolish,
PSA.49.13	And of those after them who approve their words. Selah.
PSA.49.14	As sheep they are appointed for Sheol;
PSA.49.14	Death shall be their shepherd;
PSA.49.14	And the upright shall rule over them in the morning,
PSA.49.14	And their form shall be for Sheol to consume
PSA.49.14	So that they have no habitation.
PSA.49.15	But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol,
PSA.49.15	For He will receive me. Selah.
PSA.49.16	Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich,
PSA.49.16	When the 
PSA.49.17	For when he dies he will carry nothing away;
PSA.49.17	His 
PSA.49.18	Though while he lives he congratulates himself—
PSA.49.18	And though 
PSA.49.19	He shall go to the generation of his fathers;
PSA.49.19	They will never see the light.
PSA.49.20	Man in 
PSA.49.20	Is like the beasts that perish.
PSA.50.1	The Mighty One, God, the L
PSA.50.1	And summoned the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.
PSA.50.2	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
PSA.50.2	God has shone forth.
PSA.50.3	May our God come and not keep silence;
PSA.50.3	Fire devours before Him,
PSA.50.3	And it is very tempestuous around Him.
PSA.50.4	He summons the heavens above,
PSA.50.4	And the earth, to judge His people:
PSA.50.5	“Gather My godly ones to Me,
PSA.50.5	Those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.”
PSA.50.6	And the heavens declare His righteousness,
PSA.50.6	For God Himself is judge. Selah.
PSA.50.7	“Hear, O My people, and I will speak;
PSA.50.7	O Israel, I will testify against you;
PSA.50.7	I am God, your God.
PSA.50.8	I do not reprove you for your sacrifices,
PSA.50.8	And your burnt offerings are continually before Me.
PSA.50.9	I shall take no young bull out of your house
PSA.50.9	Nor male goats out of your folds.
PSA.50.10	For every beast of the forest is Mine,
PSA.50.10	The cattle on a thousand hills.
PSA.50.11	I know every bird of the mountains,
PSA.50.11	And everything that moves in the field is 
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry I would not tell you,
PSA.50.12	For the world is Mine, and all it contains.
PSA.50.13	Shall I eat the flesh of bulls
PSA.50.13	Or drink the blood of male goats?
PSA.50.14	Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving
PSA.50.14	And pay your vows to the Most High;
PSA.50.15	Call upon Me in the day of trouble;
PSA.50.15	I shall rescue you, and you will honor Me.”
PSA.50.16	But to the wicked God says,
PSA.50.16	“What right have you to tell of My statutes
PSA.50.16	And to take My covenant in your mouth?
PSA.50.17	For you hate discipline,
PSA.50.17	And you cast My words behind you.
PSA.50.18	When you see a thief, you are pleased with him,
PSA.50.18	And you associate with adulterers.
PSA.50.19	You let your mouth loose in evil
PSA.50.19	And your tongue frames deceit.
PSA.50.20	You sit and speak against your brother;
PSA.50.20	You slander your own mother’s son.
PSA.50.21	These things you have done and I kept silence;
PSA.50.21	You thought that I was just like you;
PSA.50.21	I will reprove you and state 
PSA.50.22	“Now consider this, you who forget God,
PSA.50.22	Or I will tear 
PSA.50.23	He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me;
PSA.50.23	And to him who orders 
PSA.50.23	I shall show the salvation of God.”
PSA.51.1	Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness;
PSA.51.1	According to the greatness of Your compassion blot out my transgressions.
PSA.51.2	Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity
PSA.51.2	And cleanse me from my sin.
PSA.51.3	For I know my transgressions,
PSA.51.3	And my sin is ever before me.
PSA.51.4	Against You, You only, I have sinned
PSA.51.4	And done what is evil in Your sight,
PSA.51.4	So that You 
PSA.51.4	And blameless when You judge.
PSA.51.5	Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,
PSA.51.5	And in sin my mother conceived me.
PSA.51.6	Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being,
PSA.51.6	And in the hidden part You will make me know wisdom.
PSA.51.7	Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;
PSA.51.7	Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Make me to hear joy and gladness,
PSA.51.8	Let the bones which You have broken rejoice.
PSA.51.9	Hide Your face from my sins
PSA.51.9	And blot out all my iniquities.
PSA.51.10	Create in me a clean heart, O God,
PSA.51.10	And renew a steadfast spirit within me.
PSA.51.11	Do not cast me away from Your presence
PSA.51.11	And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.
PSA.51.12	Restore to me the joy of Your salvation
PSA.51.12	And sustain me with a willing spirit.
PSA.51.13	And sinners will 
PSA.51.14	Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation;
PSA.51.15	O Lord, open my lips,
PSA.51.15	That my mouth may declare Your praise.
PSA.51.16	For You do not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would give it;
PSA.51.16	You are not pleased with burnt offering.
PSA.51.17	The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;
PSA.51.17	A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.
PSA.51.18	By Your favor do good to Zion;
PSA.51.18	Build the walls of Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices,
PSA.51.19	In burnt offering and whole burnt offering;
PSA.51.19	Then young bulls will be offered on Your altar.
PSA.52.1	Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man?
PSA.52.1	The lovingkindness of God 
PSA.52.2	Your tongue devises destruction,
PSA.52.2	Like a sharp razor, O worker of deceit.
PSA.52.3	You love evil more than good,
PSA.52.3	Falsehood more than speaking what is right. Selah.
PSA.52.4	You love all words that devour,
PSA.52.4	O deceitful tongue.
PSA.52.5	But God will break you down forever;
PSA.52.5	He will snatch you up and tear you away from 
PSA.52.5	And uproot you from the land of the living. Selah.
PSA.52.6	The righteous will see and fear,
PSA.52.6	And will laugh at him, 
PSA.52.7	“Behold, the man who would not make God his refuge,
PSA.52.7	But trusted in the abundance of his riches
PSA.52.8	But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God;
PSA.52.8	I trust in the lovingkindness of God forever and ever.
PSA.52.9	I will give You thanks forever, because You have done 
PSA.52.9	And I will wait on Your name, for 
PSA.53.1	The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God,”
PSA.53.1	They are corrupt, and have committed abominable injustice;
PSA.53.1	There is no one who does good.
PSA.53.2	God has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men
PSA.53.2	To see if there is anyone who understands,
PSA.53.2	Who seeks after God.
PSA.53.3	Every one of them has turned aside; together they have become corrupt;
PSA.53.3	There is no one who does good, not even one.
PSA.53.4	Have the workers of wickedness no knowledge,
PSA.53.4	Who eat up My people 
PSA.53.4	And have not called upon God?
PSA.53.5	There they were in great fear 
PSA.53.5	For God scattered the bones of him who encamped against you;
PSA.53.5	You put 
PSA.53.6	Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!
PSA.53.6	When God restores His captive people,
PSA.53.6	Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
PSA.54.1	Save me, O God, by Your name,
PSA.54.1	And 
PSA.54.2	Hear my prayer, O God;
PSA.54.2	Give ear to the words of my mouth.
PSA.54.3	For strangers have risen against me
PSA.54.3	And violent men have sought my life;
PSA.54.3	They have not set God before them. Selah.
PSA.54.4	Behold, God is my helper;
PSA.54.4	The Lord is the sustainer of my soul.
PSA.54.5	Destroy them in Your faithfulness.
PSA.54.6	Willingly I will sacrifice to You;
PSA.54.6	I will give thanks to Your name, O L
PSA.54.7	For He has delivered me from all trouble,
PSA.54.7	And my eye has looked 
PSA.55.1	Give ear to my prayer, O God;
PSA.55.1	And do not hide Yourself from my supplication.
PSA.55.2	Give heed to me and answer me;
PSA.55.2	I am restless in my complaint and 
PSA.55.3	Because of the voice of the enemy,
PSA.55.3	Because of the pressure of the wicked;
PSA.55.3	For they bring down trouble upon me
PSA.55.3	And in anger they bear a grudge against me.
PSA.55.4	My heart is in anguish within me,
PSA.55.4	And the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
PSA.55.5	Fear and trembling come upon me,
PSA.55.5	And horror has overwhelmed me.
PSA.55.6	I said, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove!
PSA.55.6	I would fly away and 
PSA.55.7	Behold, I would wander far away,
PSA.55.7	I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah.
PSA.55.8	I would hasten to my place of refuge
PSA.55.8	From the stormy wind 
PSA.55.9	Confuse, O Lord, divide their tongues,
PSA.55.9	For I have seen violence and strife in the city.
PSA.55.10	Day and night they go around her upon her walls,
PSA.55.10	And iniquity and mischief are in her midst.
PSA.55.11	Destruction is in her midst;
PSA.55.11	Oppression and deceit do not depart from her streets.
PSA.55.12	For it is not an enemy who reproaches me,
PSA.55.12	Then I could bear 
PSA.55.12	Nor is it one who hates me who has exalted himself against me,
PSA.55.12	Then I could hide myself from him.
PSA.55.13	But it is you, a man my equal,
PSA.55.13	My companion and my familiar friend;
PSA.55.14	We who had sweet 
PSA.55.14	Walked in the house of God in the throng.
PSA.55.15	Let death come deceitfully upon them;
PSA.55.15	Let them go down alive to Sheol,
PSA.55.15	For evil is in their dwelling, in their midst.
PSA.55.16	As for me, I shall call upon God,
PSA.55.16	And the L
PSA.55.17	Evening and morning and at noon, I will complain and murmur,
PSA.55.17	And He will hear my voice.
PSA.55.18	He will redeem my soul in peace from the battle 
PSA.55.18	For they are many 
PSA.55.19	God will hear and answer them—
PSA.55.19	Even the one who sits enthroned from of old— Selah.
PSA.55.19	With whom there is no change,
PSA.55.19	And who do not fear God.
PSA.55.20	He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him;
PSA.55.20	He has 
PSA.55.21	His speech was smoother than butter,
PSA.55.21	But his heart was war;
PSA.55.21	His words were softer than oil,
PSA.55.21	Yet they were drawn swords.
PSA.55.22	Cast your burden upon the L
PSA.55.22	He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.
PSA.55.23	But You, O God, will bring them down to the pit of destruction;
PSA.55.23	Men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days.
PSA.55.23	But I will trust in You.
PSA.56.1	Be gracious to me, O God, for man has trampled upon me;
PSA.56.1	Fighting all day long he oppresses me.
PSA.56.2	My foes have trampled upon me all day long,
PSA.56.2	For they are many who fight proudly against me.
PSA.56.3	When I am afraid,
PSA.56.3	I will put my trust in You.
PSA.56.4	In God, whose word I praise,
PSA.56.4	In God I have put my trust;
PSA.56.4	I shall not be afraid.
PSA.56.4	What can 
PSA.56.5	All day long they 
PSA.56.5	All their thoughts are against me for evil.
PSA.56.6	They 
PSA.56.6	They watch my steps,
PSA.56.6	As they have waited 
PSA.56.7	Because of wickedness, cast them forth,
PSA.56.7	In anger put down the peoples, O God!
PSA.56.8	You have taken account of my wanderings;
PSA.56.8	Put my tears in Your bottle.
PSA.56.8	Are 
PSA.56.9	Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call;
PSA.56.9	This I know, 
PSA.56.10	In God, 
PSA.56.10	In the L
PSA.56.11	In God I have put my 
PSA.56.11	What can man do to me?
PSA.56.12	Your vows are 
PSA.56.12	I will render thank offerings to You.
PSA.56.13	For You have delivered my soul from death,
PSA.56.13	Indeed my feet from stumbling,
PSA.56.13	So that I may walk before God
PSA.56.13	In the light of the living.
PSA.57.1	Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me,
PSA.57.1	For my soul takes refuge in You;
PSA.57.1	And in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge
PSA.57.1	Until destruction passes by.
PSA.57.2	I will cry to God Most High,
PSA.57.2	To God who accomplishes 
PSA.57.3	He will send from heaven and save me;
PSA.57.3	He reproaches him who tramples upon me. Selah.
PSA.57.3	God will send forth His lovingkindness and His truth.
PSA.57.4	My soul is among lions;
PSA.57.4	I must lie among those who breathe forth fire,
PSA.57.4	And their tongue a sharp sword.
PSA.57.5	Be exalted above the heavens, O God;
PSA.57.6	They have 
PSA.57.6	My soul is bowed down;
PSA.57.6	They dug a pit before me;
PSA.57.6	They 
PSA.57.7	My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast;
PSA.57.7	I will sing, yes, I will sing praises!
PSA.57.8	Awake, my glory!
PSA.57.8	Awake, harp and lyre!
PSA.57.8	I will awaken the dawn.
PSA.57.9	I will give thanks to You, O Lord, among the peoples;
PSA.57.9	I will sing praises to You among the nations.
PSA.57.10	For Your lovingkindness is great to the heavens
PSA.57.10	And Your truth to the clouds.
PSA.57.11	Be exalted above the heavens, O God;
PSA.58.1	Do you indeed speak righteousness, O 
PSA.58.1	Do you judge 
PSA.58.2	No, in heart you work unrighteousness;
PSA.58.2	On earth you weigh out the violence of your hands.
PSA.58.3	The wicked are estranged from the womb;
PSA.58.3	These who speak lies go astray from birth.
PSA.58.4	They have venom like the venom of a serpent;
PSA.58.4	Like a deaf cobra that stops up its ear,
PSA.58.5	So that it does not hear the voice of charmers,
PSA.58.6	O God, shatter their teeth in their mouth;
PSA.58.6	Break out the fangs of the young lions, O L
PSA.58.7	Let them flow away like water that runs off;
PSA.58.9	Before your pots can feel 
PSA.58.9	He will sweep them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.
PSA.58.10	The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance;
PSA.58.10	He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
PSA.58.11	And men will say, “Surely there is a reward for the righteous;
PSA.58.11	Surely there is a God who judges on earth!”
PSA.59.1	Deliver me from my enemies, O my God;
PSA.59.1	Set me 
PSA.59.2	Deliver me from those who do iniquity
PSA.59.2	And save me from men of bloodshed.
PSA.59.3	For behold, they have set an ambush for my life;
PSA.59.3	Fierce men 
PSA.59.3	Not for my transgression nor for my sin, O L
PSA.59.4	For no guilt of 
PSA.59.4	Arouse Yourself to help me, and see!
PSA.59.5	You, O L
PSA.59.5	Awake to punish all the nations;
PSA.59.5	Do not be gracious to any 
PSA.59.6	They return at evening, they howl like a dog,
PSA.59.6	And go around the city.
PSA.59.7	Behold, they belch forth with their mouth;
PSA.59.7	Swords are in their lips,
PSA.59.7	For, 
PSA.59.8	But You, O L
PSA.59.8	You scoff at all the nations.
PSA.59.9	For God is my stronghold.
PSA.59.10	My God in His lovingkindness will meet me;
PSA.59.10	God will let me look 
PSA.59.11	Do not slay them, or my people will forget;
PSA.59.11	Scatter them by Your power, and bring them down,
PSA.59.11	O Lord, our shield.
PSA.59.12	Let them even be caught in their pride,
PSA.59.12	And on account of curses and lies which they utter.
PSA.59.13	That 
PSA.59.13	To the ends of the earth. Selah.
PSA.59.14	They return at evening, they howl like a dog,
PSA.59.14	And go around the city.
PSA.59.15	They wander about 
PSA.59.15	And growl if they are not satisfied.
PSA.59.16	But as for me, I shall sing of Your strength;
PSA.59.16	Yes, I shall joyfully sing of Your lovingkindness in the morning,
PSA.59.16	For You have been my stronghold
PSA.59.16	And a refuge in the day of my distress.
PSA.59.17	O my strength, I will sing praises to You;
PSA.59.17	For God is my stronghold, the God who shows me lovingkindness.
PSA.60.1	O God, You have rejected us. You have broken us;
PSA.60.1	You have been angry; O, restore us.
PSA.60.2	You have made the land quake, You have split it open;
PSA.60.2	Heal its breaches, for it totters.
PSA.60.3	You have made Your people experience hardship;
PSA.60.3	You have given us wine to drink that makes us stagger.
PSA.60.4	You have given a banner to those who fear You,
PSA.60.4	That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
PSA.60.5	That Your beloved may be delivered,
PSA.60.5	Save with Your right hand, and answer us!
PSA.60.6	God has spoken in His 
PSA.60.6	“I will exult, I will portion out Shechem and measure out the valley of Succoth.
PSA.60.7	Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine;
PSA.60.7	Ephraim also is the helmet of My head;
PSA.60.7	Judah is My 
PSA.60.8	Moab is My washbowl;
PSA.60.8	Over Edom I shall throw My shoe;
PSA.60.8	Shout loud, O Philistia, because of Me!”
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me into the besieged city?
PSA.60.9	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.60.10	Have not You Yourself, O God, rejected us?
PSA.60.10	And will You not go forth with our armies, O God?
PSA.60.11	O give us help against the adversary,
PSA.60.11	For deliverance by man is in vain.
PSA.60.12	Through God we shall do valiantly,
PSA.60.12	And it is He who will tread down our adversaries.
PSA.61.1	Hear my cry, O God;
PSA.61.1	Give heed to my prayer.
PSA.61.2	From the end of the earth I call to You when my heart is faint;
PSA.61.2	Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
PSA.61.3	For You have been a refuge for me,
PSA.61.3	A tower of strength against the enemy.
PSA.61.4	Let me dwell in Your tent forever;
PSA.61.4	Let me take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah.
PSA.61.5	For You have heard my vows, O God;
PSA.61.5	You have given 
PSA.61.6	You will prolong the king’s life;
PSA.61.6	His years will be as many generations.
PSA.61.7	He will abide before God forever;
PSA.61.7	Appoint lovingkindness and truth that they may preserve him.
PSA.61.8	So I will sing praise to Your name forever,
PSA.61.8	That I may pay my vows day by day.
PSA.62.1	My soul 
PSA.62.1	From Him is my salvation.
PSA.62.2	He only is my rock and my salvation,
PSA.62.2	My stronghold; I shall not be greatly shaken.
PSA.62.3	How long will you assail a man,
PSA.62.3	That you may murder 
PSA.62.3	Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
PSA.62.4	They have counseled only to thrust him down from his high position;
PSA.62.4	They delight in falsehood;
PSA.62.4	They bless with their mouth,
PSA.62.4	But inwardly they curse. Selah.
PSA.62.5	My soul, wait in silence for God only,
PSA.62.5	For my hope is from Him.
PSA.62.6	He only is my rock and my salvation,
PSA.62.6	My stronghold; I shall not be shaken.
PSA.62.7	On God my salvation and my glory 
PSA.62.7	The rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.
PSA.62.8	Trust in Him at all times, O people;
PSA.62.8	Pour out your heart before Him;
PSA.62.8	God is a refuge for us. Selah.
PSA.62.9	Men of low degree are only vanity and men of rank are a lie;
PSA.62.9	In the balances they go up;
PSA.62.9	They are together lighter than breath.
PSA.62.10	Do not trust in oppression
PSA.62.10	And do not vainly hope in robbery;
PSA.62.10	If riches increase, do not set 
PSA.62.11	That power belongs to God;
PSA.62.12	And lovingkindness is Yours, O Lord,
PSA.62.12	For You recompense a man according to his work.
PSA.63.1	O God, You are my God; I shall seek You 
PSA.63.1	My soul thirsts for You, my flesh yearns for You,
PSA.63.1	In a dry and weary land where there is no water.
PSA.63.2	Thus I have seen You in the sanctuary,
PSA.63.2	To see Your power and Your glory.
PSA.63.3	Because Your lovingkindness is better than life,
PSA.63.3	My lips will praise You.
PSA.63.4	So I will bless You as long as I live;
PSA.63.4	I will lift up my hands in Your name.
PSA.63.5	My soul is satisfied as with 
PSA.63.5	And my mouth offers praises with joyful lips.
PSA.63.6	When I remember You on my bed,
PSA.63.6	I meditate on You in the night watches,
PSA.63.7	For You have been my help,
PSA.63.7	And in the shadow of Your wings I sing for joy.
PSA.63.8	My soul clings to You;
PSA.63.8	Your right hand upholds me.
PSA.63.9	But those who seek my life to destroy it,
PSA.63.9	Will go into the depths of the earth.
PSA.63.10	They will be delivered over to the power of the sword;
PSA.63.10	They will be a prey for foxes.
PSA.63.11	But the king will rejoice in God;
PSA.63.11	Everyone who swears by Him will glory,
PSA.63.11	For the mouths of those who speak lies will be stopped.
PSA.64.1	Hear my voice, O God, in my 
PSA.64.1	Preserve my life from dread of the enemy.
PSA.64.2	Hide me from the secret counsel of evildoers,
PSA.64.2	From the tumult of those who do iniquity,
PSA.64.3	Who have sharpened their tongue like a sword.
PSA.64.3	They aimed bitter speech 
PSA.64.4	To shoot from concealment at the blameless;
PSA.64.4	Suddenly they shoot at him, and do not fear.
PSA.64.5	They hold fast to themselves an evil purpose;
PSA.64.5	They talk of laying snares secretly;
PSA.64.5	They say, “Who can see them?”
PSA.64.6	They 
PSA.64.6	“We are ready with a well-conceived plot”;
PSA.64.6	For the inward thought and the heart of a man are 
PSA.64.7	But God will shoot at them with an arrow;
PSA.64.7	Suddenly they will be wounded.
PSA.64.8	So they will make him stumble;
PSA.64.8	Their own tongue is against them;
PSA.64.8	All who see them will shake the head.
PSA.64.9	Then all men will fear,
PSA.64.9	And they will declare the work of God,
PSA.64.9	And will consider what He has done.
PSA.64.10	The righteous man will be glad in the L
PSA.64.10	And all the upright in heart will glory.
PSA.65.1	There will be silence before You, 
PSA.65.1	And to You the vow will be performed.
PSA.65.2	O You who hear prayer,
PSA.65.2	To You all men come.
PSA.65.3	Iniquities prevail against me;
PSA.65.3	As for our transgressions, You forgive them.
PSA.65.4	How blessed is the one whom You choose and bring near 
PSA.65.4	To dwell in Your courts.
PSA.65.4	We will be satisfied with the goodness of Your house,
PSA.65.4	Your holy temple.
PSA.65.5	By awesome 
PSA.65.5	You who are the trust of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest sea;
PSA.65.6	Who establishes the mountains by His strength,
PSA.65.6	Being girded with might;
PSA.65.7	Who stills the roaring of the seas,
PSA.65.7	The roaring of their waves,
PSA.65.7	And the tumult of the peoples.
PSA.65.8	They who dwell in the ends 
PSA.65.8	You make the dawn and the sunset shout for joy.
PSA.65.9	You visit the earth and cause it to overflow;
PSA.65.9	You greatly enrich it;
PSA.65.9	The stream of God is full of water;
PSA.65.9	You prepare their grain, for thus You prepare the earth.
PSA.65.10	You water its furrows abundantly,
PSA.65.10	You settle its ridges,
PSA.65.10	You soften it with showers,
PSA.65.10	You bless its growth.
PSA.65.11	You have crowned the year with Your bounty,
PSA.65.11	And Your paths drip 
PSA.65.12	The pastures of the wilderness drip,
PSA.65.12	And the hills gird themselves with rejoicing.
PSA.65.13	The meadows are clothed with flocks
PSA.65.13	And the valleys are covered with grain;
PSA.65.13	They shout for joy, yes, they sing.
PSA.66.1	Shout joyfully to God, all the earth;
PSA.66.2	Sing the glory of His name;
PSA.66.2	Make His praise glorious.
PSA.66.3	Say to God, “How awesome are Your works!
PSA.66.3	Because of the greatness of Your power Your enemies will give feigned obedience to You.
PSA.66.4	All the earth will worship You,
PSA.66.4	And will sing praises to You;
PSA.66.4	They will sing praises to Your name.” Selah.
PSA.66.5	Come and see the works of God,
PSA.66.6	He turned the sea into dry land;
PSA.66.6	They passed through the river on foot;
PSA.66.6	There let us rejoice in Him!
PSA.66.7	He rules by His might forever;
PSA.66.7	His eyes keep watch on the nations;
PSA.66.7	Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
PSA.66.8	Bless our God, O peoples,
PSA.66.8	And sound His praise abroad,
PSA.66.9	Who keeps us in life
PSA.66.9	And does not allow our feet to slip.
PSA.66.10	For You have tried us, O God;
PSA.66.10	You have refined us as silver is refined.
PSA.66.11	You brought us into the net;
PSA.66.11	You laid an oppressive burden upon our loins.
PSA.66.12	You made men ride over our heads;
PSA.66.12	We went through fire and through water,
PSA.66.12	Yet You brought us out into 
PSA.66.13	I shall come into Your house with burnt offerings;
PSA.66.13	I shall pay You my vows,
PSA.66.14	Which my lips uttered
PSA.66.14	And my mouth spoke when I was in distress.
PSA.66.15	I shall offer to You burnt offerings of fat beasts,
PSA.66.15	With the smoke of rams;
PSA.66.15	I shall make 
PSA.66.16	Come 
PSA.66.16	And I will tell of what He has done for my soul.
PSA.66.17	I cried to Him with my mouth,
PSA.66.17	And He was extolled with my tongue.
PSA.66.18	If I 
PSA.66.18	The Lord will not hear;
PSA.66.19	But certainly God has heard;
PSA.66.19	He has given heed to the voice of my prayer.
PSA.66.20	Blessed be God,
PSA.66.20	Who has not turned away my prayer
PSA.66.20	Nor His lovingkindness from me.
PSA.67.1	God be gracious to us and bless us,
PSA.67.2	That Your way may be known on the earth,
PSA.67.2	Your salvation among all nations.
PSA.67.3	Let the peoples praise You, O God;
PSA.67.3	Let all the peoples praise You.
PSA.67.4	Let the nations be glad and sing for joy;
PSA.67.4	For You will judge the peoples with uprightness
PSA.67.4	And guide the nations on the earth. Selah.
PSA.67.5	Let the peoples praise You, O God;
PSA.67.5	Let all the peoples praise You.
PSA.67.6	The earth has yielded its produce;
PSA.67.6	God, our God, blesses us.
PSA.67.7	God blesses us,
PSA.68.1	Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered,
PSA.68.1	And let those who hate Him flee before Him.
PSA.68.2	As smoke is driven away, 
PSA.68.2	As wax melts before the fire,
PSA.68.3	But let the righteous be glad; let them exult before God;
PSA.68.3	Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.
PSA.68.4	Sing to God, sing praises to His name;
PSA.68.4	Lift up 
PSA.68.4	Whose name is the L
PSA.68.5	A father of the fatherless and a judge 
PSA.68.5	Is God in His holy habitation.
PSA.68.6	God makes a home for the lonely;
PSA.68.6	He leads out the prisoners into prosperity,
PSA.68.6	Only the rebellious dwell in a parched land.
PSA.68.7	O God, when You went forth before Your people,
PSA.68.7	When You marched through the wilderness, Selah.
PSA.68.8	The earth quaked;
PSA.68.8	The heavens also dropped 
PSA.68.8	Sinai itself 
PSA.68.9	You shed abroad a plentiful rain, O God;
PSA.68.9	You confirmed Your inheritance when it was parched.
PSA.68.10	Your creatures settled in it;
PSA.68.10	You provided in Your goodness for the poor, O God.
PSA.68.11	The Lord gives the command;
PSA.68.11	The women who proclaim the 
PSA.68.12	“Kings of armies flee, they flee,
PSA.68.12	And she who remains at home will divide the spoil!”
PSA.68.13	And its pinions with glistening gold.
PSA.68.14	When the Almighty scattered the kings there,
PSA.68.14	It was snowing in Zalmon.
PSA.68.15	A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan;
PSA.68.15	A mountain 
PSA.68.16	Why do you look with envy, O mountains with 
PSA.68.16	At the mountain which God has desired for His abode?
PSA.68.16	Surely the L
PSA.68.17	The chariots of God are 
PSA.68.17	The Lord is among them 
PSA.68.18	You have ascended on high, You have led captive 
PSA.68.18	You have received gifts among men,
PSA.68.18	Even 
PSA.68.19	Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burden,
PSA.68.19	The God 
PSA.68.20	God is to us a God of deliverances;
PSA.68.20	And to G
PSA.68.21	Surely God will shatter the head of His enemies,
PSA.68.21	The hairy crown of him who goes on in his guilty deeds.
PSA.68.22	The Lord said, “I will bring 
PSA.68.22	I will bring 
PSA.68.23	That your foot may shatter 
PSA.68.23	The tongue of your dogs 
PSA.68.24	They have seen Your procession, O God,
PSA.68.24	The procession of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
PSA.68.25	The singers went on, the musicians after 
PSA.68.25	In the midst of the maidens beating tambourines.
PSA.68.26	Bless God in the congregations,
PSA.68.27	There is Benjamin, the youngest, ruling them,
PSA.68.27	The princes of Judah 
PSA.68.27	The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.
PSA.68.28	Your God has commanded your strength;
PSA.68.28	Show Yourself strong, O God, who have acted on our behalf.
PSA.68.29	Because of Your temple at Jerusalem
PSA.68.29	Kings will bring gifts to You.
PSA.68.30	Rebuke the beasts in the reeds,
PSA.68.30	The herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples,
PSA.68.30	Trampling under foot the pieces of silver;
PSA.68.30	He has scattered the peoples who delight in war.
PSA.68.31	Envoys will come out of Egypt;
PSA.68.31	Ethiopia will quickly stretch out her hands to God.
PSA.68.32	Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth,
PSA.68.32	Sing praises to the Lord, Selah.
PSA.68.33	To Him who rides upon the highest heavens, which are from ancient times;
PSA.68.33	Behold, He speaks forth with His voice, a mighty voice.
PSA.68.34	Ascribe strength to God;
PSA.68.34	His majesty is over Israel
PSA.68.34	And His strength is in the skies.
PSA.68.35	O God, 
PSA.68.35	The God of Israel Himself gives strength and power to the people.
PSA.68.35	Blessed be God!
PSA.69.1	Save me, O God,
PSA.69.1	For the waters have threatened my life.
PSA.69.2	I have sunk in deep mire, and there is no foothold;
PSA.69.2	I have come into deep waters, and a flood overflows me.
PSA.69.3	I am weary with my crying; my throat is parched;
PSA.69.3	My eyes fail while I wait for my God.
PSA.69.4	Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head;
PSA.69.4	Those who would destroy me are powerful, being wrongfully my enemies;
PSA.69.4	What I did not steal, I then have to restore.
PSA.69.5	O God, it is You who knows my folly,
PSA.69.5	And my wrongs are not hidden from You.
PSA.69.6	May those who wait for You not be ashamed through me, O Lord G
PSA.69.6	May those who seek You not be dishonored through me, O God of Israel,
PSA.69.7	Because for Your sake I have borne reproach;
PSA.69.7	Dishonor has covered my face.
PSA.69.8	I have become estranged from my brothers
PSA.69.8	And an alien to my mother’s sons.
PSA.69.9	For zeal for Your house has consumed me,
PSA.69.9	And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me.
PSA.69.10	When I wept in my soul with fasting,
PSA.69.10	It became my reproach.
PSA.69.11	When I made sackcloth my clothing,
PSA.69.11	I became a byword to them.
PSA.69.12	Those who sit in the gate talk about me,
PSA.69.12	And I 
PSA.69.13	But as for me, my prayer is to You, O L
PSA.69.13	O God, in the greatness of Your lovingkindness,
PSA.69.13	Answer me with Your saving truth.
PSA.69.14	Deliver me from the mire and do not let me sink;
PSA.69.14	May I be delivered from my foes and from the deep waters.
PSA.69.15	May the flood of water not overflow me
PSA.69.15	Nor the deep swallow me up,
PSA.69.15	Nor the pit shut its mouth on me.
PSA.69.16	Answer me, O L
PSA.69.16	According to the greatness of Your compassion, turn to me,
PSA.69.17	And do not hide Your face from Your servant,
PSA.69.17	For I am in distress; answer me quickly.
PSA.69.18	Oh draw near to my soul 
PSA.69.18	Ransom me because of my enemies!
PSA.69.19	You know my reproach and my shame and my dishonor;
PSA.69.19	All my adversaries are 
PSA.69.20	Reproach has broken my heart and I am so sick.
PSA.69.20	And I looked for sympathy, but there was none,
PSA.69.20	And for comforters, but I found none.
PSA.69.21	They also gave me 
PSA.69.21	And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
PSA.69.22	May their table before them become a snare;
PSA.69.22	And when they are in peace, 
PSA.69.23	May their eyes grow dim so that they cannot see,
PSA.69.23	And make their loins shake continually.
PSA.69.24	Pour out Your indignation on them,
PSA.69.24	And may Your burning anger overtake them.
PSA.69.25	May their camp be desolate;
PSA.69.25	May none dwell in their tents.
PSA.69.26	For they have persecuted him whom You Yourself have smitten,
PSA.69.26	And they tell of the pain of those whom You have wounded.
PSA.69.27	Add iniquity to their iniquity,
PSA.69.27	And may they not come into Your righteousness.
PSA.69.28	May they be blotted out of the book of life
PSA.69.28	And may they not be recorded with the righteous.
PSA.69.29	But I am afflicted and in pain;
PSA.69.29	May Your salvation, O God, set me 
PSA.69.30	I will praise the name of God with song
PSA.69.30	And magnify Him with thanksgiving.
PSA.69.31	And it will please the L
PSA.69.32	The humble have seen 
PSA.69.32	You who seek God, let your heart revive.
PSA.69.33	For the L
PSA.69.33	And does not despise His 
PSA.69.34	Let heaven and earth praise Him,
PSA.69.34	The seas and everything that moves in them.
PSA.69.35	For God will save Zion and build the cities of Judah,
PSA.69.35	That they may dwell there and possess it.
PSA.69.36	The descendants of His servants will inherit it,
PSA.69.36	And those who love His name will dwell in it.
PSA.70.1	O God, 
PSA.70.1	O L
PSA.70.2	Let those be ashamed and humiliated
PSA.70.2	Who seek my life;
PSA.70.2	Let those be turned back and dishonored
PSA.70.2	Who delight in my hurt.
PSA.70.3	Let those be turned back because of their shame
PSA.70.3	Who say, “Aha, aha!”
PSA.70.4	Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You;
PSA.70.4	And let those who love Your salvation say continually,
PSA.70.4	“Let God be magnified.”
PSA.70.5	But I am afflicted and needy;
PSA.70.5	Hasten to me, O God!
PSA.70.5	You are my help and my deliverer;
PSA.70.5	O L
PSA.71.1	In You, O L
PSA.71.1	Let me never be ashamed.
PSA.71.2	In Your righteousness deliver me and rescue me;
PSA.71.2	Incline Your ear to me and save me.
PSA.71.3	Be to me a rock of habitation to which I may continually come;
PSA.71.3	You have given commandment to save me,
PSA.71.3	For You are my rock and my fortress.
PSA.71.4	Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked,
PSA.71.4	Out of the grasp of the wrongdoer and ruthless man,
PSA.71.5	For You are my hope;
PSA.71.5	O Lord G
PSA.71.6	By You I have been sustained from 
PSA.71.6	You are He who took me from my mother’s womb;
PSA.71.6	My praise is continually of You.
PSA.71.7	I have become a marvel to many,
PSA.71.7	For You are my strong refuge.
PSA.71.8	My mouth is filled with Your praise
PSA.71.8	And with Your glory all day long.
PSA.71.9	Do not cast me off in the time of old age;
PSA.71.9	Do not forsake me when my strength fails.
PSA.71.10	For my enemies have spoken against me;
PSA.71.10	And those who watch for my life have consulted together,
PSA.71.11	Saying, “God has forsaken him;
PSA.71.11	Pursue and seize him, for there is no one to deliver.”
PSA.71.12	O God, do not be far from me;
PSA.71.12	O my God, hasten to my help!
PSA.71.13	Let those who are adversaries of my soul be ashamed 
PSA.71.13	Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor, who seek to injure me.
PSA.71.14	But as for me, I will hope continually,
PSA.71.14	And will praise You yet more and more.
PSA.71.15	My mouth shall tell of Your righteousness
PSA.71.15	For I do not know the sum 
PSA.71.16	I will come with the mighty deeds of the Lord G
PSA.71.16	I will make mention of Your righteousness, Yours alone.
PSA.71.17	O God, You have taught me from my youth,
PSA.71.17	And I still declare Your wondrous deeds.
PSA.71.18	And even when 
PSA.71.18	Until I declare Your strength to 
PSA.71.18	Your power to all who are to come.
PSA.71.19	For Your righteousness, O God, 
PSA.71.19	You who have done great things;
PSA.71.19	O God, who is like You?
PSA.71.20	You who have shown 
PSA.71.20	Will revive me again,
PSA.71.20	And will bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
PSA.71.21	May You increase my greatness
PSA.71.21	And turn 
PSA.71.22	I will also praise You with a harp,
PSA.71.22	To You I will sing praises with the lyre,
PSA.71.22	O Holy One of Israel.
PSA.71.23	My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to You;
PSA.71.23	And my soul, which You have redeemed.
PSA.71.24	My tongue also will utter Your righteousness all day long;
PSA.71.24	For they are ashamed, for they are humiliated who seek my hurt.
PSA.72.1	Give the king Your judgments, O God,
PSA.72.1	And Your righteousness to the king’s son.
PSA.72.2	May he judge Your people with righteousness
PSA.72.2	And 
PSA.72.3	Let the mountains bring peace to the people,
PSA.72.3	And the hills, in righteousness.
PSA.72.4	May he vindicate the afflicted of the people,
PSA.72.4	Save the children of the needy
PSA.72.4	And crush the oppressor.
PSA.72.5	Let them fear You while the sun 
PSA.72.5	And as long as the moon, throughout all generations.
PSA.72.6	May he come down like rain upon the mown grass,
PSA.72.6	Like showers that water the earth.
PSA.72.7	In his days may the righteous flourish,
PSA.72.7	And abundance of peace till the moon is no more.
PSA.72.8	May he also rule from sea to sea
PSA.72.8	And from the River to the ends of the earth.
PSA.72.9	Let the nomads of the desert bow before him,
PSA.72.9	And his enemies lick the dust.
PSA.72.10	Let the kings of Tarshish and of the islands bring presents;
PSA.72.10	The kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.
PSA.72.11	And let all kings bow down before him,
PSA.72.11	All nations serve him.
PSA.72.12	For he will deliver the needy when he cries for help,
PSA.72.12	The afflicted also, and him who has no helper.
PSA.72.13	He will have compassion on the poor and needy,
PSA.72.13	And the lives of the needy he will save.
PSA.72.14	He will rescue their life from oppression and violence,
PSA.72.14	And their blood will be precious in his sight;
PSA.72.15	So may he live, and may the gold of Sheba be given to him;
PSA.72.15	And let them pray for him continually;
PSA.72.15	Let them bless him all day long.
PSA.72.16	May there be abundance of grain in the earth on top of the mountains;
PSA.72.16	Its fruit will wave like 
PSA.72.16	And may those from the city flourish like vegetation of the earth.
PSA.72.17	May his name endure forever;
PSA.72.17	May his name increase as long as the sun 
PSA.72.17	And let 
PSA.72.17	Let all nations call him blessed.
PSA.72.18	Blessed be the L
PSA.72.18	Who alone works wonders.
PSA.72.19	And blessed be His glorious name forever;
PSA.72.19	And may the whole earth be filled with His glory.
PSA.72.19	Amen, and Amen.
PSA.72.20	The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
PSA.73.1	Surely God is good to Israel,
PSA.73.1	To those who are pure in heart!
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my feet came close to stumbling,
PSA.73.2	My steps had almost slipped.
PSA.73.3	For I was envious of the arrogant
PSA.73.4	For there are no pains in their death,
PSA.73.4	And their body is fat.
PSA.73.5	They are not in trouble 
PSA.73.5	Nor are they plagued like mankind.
PSA.73.6	Therefore pride is their necklace;
PSA.73.6	The garment of violence covers them.
PSA.73.7	Their eye bulges from fatness;
PSA.73.7	The imaginations of 
PSA.73.8	They mock and wickedly speak of oppression;
PSA.73.8	They speak from on high.
PSA.73.9	They have set their mouth against the heavens,
PSA.73.9	And their tongue parades through the earth.
PSA.73.10	Therefore his people return to this place,
PSA.73.10	And waters of abundance are drunk by them.
PSA.73.11	They say, “How does God know?
PSA.73.11	And is there knowledge with the Most High?”
PSA.73.12	Behold, these are the wicked;
PSA.73.12	And always at ease, they have increased 
PSA.73.13	Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure
PSA.73.13	And washed my hands in innocence;
PSA.73.14	For I have been stricken all day long
PSA.73.14	And chastened every morning.
PSA.73.15	If I had said, “I will speak thus,”
PSA.73.15	Behold, I would have betrayed the generation of Your children.
PSA.73.16	When I pondered to understand this,
PSA.73.16	It was troublesome in my sight
PSA.73.17	Until I came into the sanctuary of God;
PSA.73.18	Surely You set them in slippery places;
PSA.73.18	You cast them down to destruction.
PSA.73.19	How they are destroyed in a moment!
PSA.73.19	They are utterly swept away by sudden terrors!
PSA.73.20	Like a dream when one awakes,
PSA.73.20	O Lord, when aroused, You will despise their form.
PSA.73.21	When my heart was embittered
PSA.73.21	And I was pierced within,
PSA.73.22	Then I was senseless and ignorant;
PSA.73.22	I was 
PSA.73.23	Nevertheless I am continually with You;
PSA.73.23	You have taken hold of my right hand.
PSA.73.24	With Your counsel You will guide me,
PSA.73.24	And afterward receive me to glory.
PSA.73.25	Whom have I in heaven 
PSA.73.25	And besides You, I desire nothing on earth.
PSA.73.26	My flesh and my heart may fail,
PSA.73.26	But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
PSA.73.27	For, behold, those who are far from You will perish;
PSA.73.27	You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to You.
PSA.73.28	But as for me, the nearness of God is my good;
PSA.73.28	I have made the Lord G
PSA.73.28	That I may tell of all Your works.
PSA.74.1	O God, why have You rejected 
PSA.74.1	Why does Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture?
PSA.74.2	Remember Your congregation, which You have purchased of old,
PSA.74.2	Which You have redeemed to be the tribe of Your inheritance;
PSA.74.3	Turn Your footsteps toward the perpetual ruins;
PSA.74.3	The enemy has damaged everything within the sanctuary.
PSA.74.4	Your adversaries have roared in the midst of Your meeting place;
PSA.74.4	They have set up their own standards for signs.
PSA.74.5	It seems as if one had lifted up
PSA.74.6	And now all its carved work
PSA.74.6	They smash with hatchet and hammers.
PSA.74.7	They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground;
PSA.74.7	They have defiled the dwelling place of Your name.
PSA.74.8	They said in their heart, “Let us completely subdue them.”
PSA.74.8	They have burned all the meeting places of God in the land.
PSA.74.9	We do not see our signs;
PSA.74.9	There is no longer any prophet,
PSA.74.9	Nor is there any among us who knows how long.
PSA.74.10	How long, O God, will the adversary revile,
PSA.74.11	Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand?
PSA.74.11	From within Your bosom, destroy 
PSA.74.12	Yet God is my king from of old,
PSA.74.12	Who works deeds of deliverance in the midst of the earth.
PSA.74.13	You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.
PSA.74.14	You crushed the heads of Leviathan;
PSA.74.14	You gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness.
PSA.74.15	You broke open springs and torrents;
PSA.74.15	You dried up ever-flowing streams.
PSA.74.16	Yours is the day, Yours also is the night;
PSA.74.16	You have prepared the light and the sun.
PSA.74.17	You have established all the boundaries of the earth;
PSA.74.17	You have made summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	Remember this, O L
PSA.74.18	And a foolish people has spurned Your name.
PSA.74.19	Do not deliver the soul of Your turtledove to the wild beast;
PSA.74.19	Do not forget the life of Your afflicted forever.
PSA.74.20	Consider the covenant;
PSA.74.20	For the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.
PSA.74.21	Let not the oppressed return dishonored;
PSA.74.21	Let the afflicted and needy praise Your name.
PSA.74.22	Arise, O God, 
PSA.74.22	Remember how the foolish man reproaches You all day long.
PSA.74.23	Do not forget the voice of Your adversaries,
PSA.74.23	The uproar of those who rise against You which ascends continually.
PSA.75.1	We give thanks to You, O God, we give thanks,
PSA.75.1	For Your name is near;
PSA.75.1	Men declare Your wondrous works.
PSA.75.2	“When I select an appointed time,
PSA.75.2	It is I who judge with equity.
PSA.75.3	The earth and all who dwell in it 
PSA.75.3	It is I who have firmly set its pillars. Selah.
PSA.75.4	I said to the boastful, ‘Do not boast,’
PSA.75.4	And to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up the horn;
PSA.75.5	Do not lift up your horn on high,
PSA.75.5	Do not speak with insolent pride.’ ”
PSA.75.6	For not from the east, nor from the west,
PSA.75.6	Nor from the desert 
PSA.75.7	But God is the Judge;
PSA.75.7	He puts down one and exalts another.
PSA.75.8	For a cup is in the hand of the L
PSA.75.8	It is well mixed, and He pours out of this;
PSA.75.8	Surely all the wicked of the earth must drain 
PSA.75.9	But as for me, I will declare 
PSA.75.9	I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
PSA.75.10	And all the horns of the wicked He will cut off,
PSA.76.1	God is known in Judah;
PSA.76.1	His name is great in Israel.
PSA.76.2	His tabernacle is in Salem;
PSA.76.2	His dwelling place also is in Zion.
PSA.76.3	There He broke the flaming arrows,
PSA.76.3	The shield and the sword and the weapons of war. Selah.
PSA.76.4	You are resplendent,
PSA.76.4	More majestic than the mountains of prey.
PSA.76.5	The stouthearted were plundered,
PSA.76.5	They sank into sleep;
PSA.76.5	And none of the warriors could use his hands.
PSA.76.6	At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob,
PSA.76.6	Both rider and horse were cast into a dead sleep.
PSA.76.7	You, even You, are to be feared;
PSA.76.7	And who may stand in Your presence when once You are angry?
PSA.76.8	You caused judgment to be heard from heaven;
PSA.76.8	The earth feared and was still
PSA.76.9	When God arose to judgment,
PSA.76.9	To save all the humble of the earth. Selah.
PSA.76.10	For the wrath of man shall praise You;
PSA.76.10	With a remnant of wrath You will gird Yourself.
PSA.76.11	Make vows to the L
PSA.76.11	Let all who are around Him bring gifts to Him who is to be feared.
PSA.76.12	He will cut off the spirit of princes;
PSA.76.12	He is feared by the kings of the earth.
PSA.77.1	My voice 
PSA.77.1	My voice 
PSA.77.2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord;
PSA.77.2	In the night my hand was stretched out 
PSA.77.2	My soul refused to be comforted.
PSA.77.4	You have held my eyelids 
PSA.77.4	I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
PSA.77.5	I have considered the days of old,
PSA.77.5	The years of long ago.
PSA.77.6	I will remember my song in the night;
PSA.77.6	I will meditate with my heart,
PSA.77.6	And my spirit ponders:
PSA.77.7	Will the Lord reject forever?
PSA.77.7	And will He never be favorable again?
PSA.77.8	Has His lovingkindness ceased forever?
PSA.77.8	Has 
PSA.77.9	Has God forgotten to be gracious,
PSA.77.9	Or has He in anger withdrawn His compassion? Selah.
PSA.77.10	Then I said, “It is my grief,
PSA.77.10	That the right hand of the Most High has changed.”
PSA.77.11	I shall remember the deeds of the L
PSA.77.11	Surely I will remember Your wonders of old.
PSA.77.12	I will meditate on all Your work
PSA.77.12	And muse on Your deeds.
PSA.77.13	Your way, O God, is holy;
PSA.77.13	What god is great like our God?
PSA.77.14	You are the God who works wonders;
PSA.77.14	You have made known Your strength among the peoples.
PSA.77.15	You have by Your power redeemed Your people,
PSA.77.15	The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
PSA.77.16	The waters saw You, O God;
PSA.77.16	The waters saw You, they were in anguish;
PSA.77.16	The deeps also trembled.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured out water;
PSA.77.17	The skies gave forth a sound;
PSA.77.17	Your arrows flashed here and there.
PSA.77.18	The sound of Your thunder was in the whirlwind;
PSA.77.18	The lightnings lit up the world;
PSA.77.18	The earth trembled and shook.
PSA.77.19	Your way was in the sea
PSA.77.19	And Your paths in the mighty waters,
PSA.77.19	And Your footprints may not be known.
PSA.77.20	You led Your people like a flock
PSA.77.20	By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
PSA.78.1	Listen, O my people, to my instruction;
PSA.78.1	Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
PSA.78.2	I will open my mouth in a parable;
PSA.78.2	I will utter dark sayings of old,
PSA.78.3	Which we have heard and known,
PSA.78.3	And our fathers have told us.
PSA.78.4	We will not conceal them from their children,
PSA.78.4	But tell to the generation to come the praises of the L
PSA.78.4	And His strength and His wondrous works that He has done.
PSA.78.5	For He established a testimony in Jacob
PSA.78.5	And appointed a law in Israel,
PSA.78.5	Which He commanded our fathers
PSA.78.5	That they should teach them to their children,
PSA.78.6	That the generation to come might know, 
PSA.78.7	That they should put their confidence in God
PSA.78.7	And not forget the works of God,
PSA.78.7	But keep His commandments,
PSA.78.8	And not be like their fathers,
PSA.78.8	A stubborn and rebellious generation,
PSA.78.8	A generation that did not 
PSA.78.8	And whose spirit was not faithful to God.
PSA.78.9	The sons of Ephraim were archers equipped with bows,
PSA.78.10	They did not keep the covenant of God
PSA.78.10	And refused to walk in His law;
PSA.78.11	They forgot His deeds
PSA.78.11	And His miracles that He had shown them.
PSA.78.12	He wrought wonders before their fathers
PSA.78.12	In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
PSA.78.13	He divided the sea and caused them to pass through,
PSA.78.13	And He made the waters stand up like a heap.
PSA.78.14	Then He led them with the cloud by day
PSA.78.14	And all the night with a light of fire.
PSA.78.15	He split the rocks in the wilderness
PSA.78.15	And gave 
PSA.78.16	He brought forth streams also from the rock
PSA.78.16	And caused waters to run down like rivers.
PSA.78.17	Yet they still continued to sin against Him,
PSA.78.17	To rebel against the Most High in the desert.
PSA.78.18	And in their heart they put God to the test
PSA.78.18	By asking food according to their desire.
PSA.78.19	Then they spoke against God;
PSA.78.19	They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
PSA.78.20	Behold, He struck the rock so that waters gushed out,
PSA.78.20	And streams were overflowing;
PSA.78.20	Can He give bread also?
PSA.78.20	Will He provide meat for His people?”
PSA.78.21	Therefore the L
PSA.78.21	And a fire was kindled against Jacob
PSA.78.21	And anger also mounted against Israel,
PSA.78.22	Because they did not believe in God
PSA.78.22	And did not trust in His salvation.
PSA.78.23	Yet He commanded the clouds above
PSA.78.23	And opened the doors of heaven;
PSA.78.24	He rained down manna upon them to eat
PSA.78.24	And gave them food from heaven.
PSA.78.25	Man did eat the bread of angels;
PSA.78.25	He sent them food in abundance.
PSA.78.26	He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens
PSA.78.26	And by His power He directed the south wind.
PSA.78.27	When He rained meat upon them like the dust,
PSA.78.27	Even winged fowl like the sand of the seas,
PSA.78.28	Then He let 
PSA.78.28	Round about their dwellings.
PSA.78.29	So they ate and were well filled,
PSA.78.29	And their desire He gave to them.
PSA.78.30	Before they had satisfied their desire,
PSA.78.30	While their food was in their mouths,
PSA.78.31	The anger of God rose against them
PSA.78.31	And killed some of their stoutest ones,
PSA.78.31	And subdued the choice men of Israel.
PSA.78.32	In spite of all this they still sinned
PSA.78.32	And did not believe in His wonderful works.
PSA.78.33	So He brought their days to an end in futility
PSA.78.33	And their years in sudden terror.
PSA.78.34	When He killed them, then they sought Him,
PSA.78.34	And returned and searched diligently for God;
PSA.78.35	And they remembered that God was their rock,
PSA.78.35	And the Most High God their Redeemer.
PSA.78.36	But they deceived Him with their mouth
PSA.78.36	And lied to Him with their tongue.
PSA.78.37	For their heart was not steadfast toward Him,
PSA.78.37	Nor were they faithful in His covenant.
PSA.78.38	But He, being compassionate, forgave 
PSA.78.38	And often He restrained His anger
PSA.78.38	And did not arouse all His wrath.
PSA.78.39	Thus He remembered that they were but flesh,
PSA.78.39	A wind that passes and does not return.
PSA.78.40	How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness
PSA.78.40	And grieved Him in the desert!
PSA.78.41	Again and again they 
PSA.78.41	And pained the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They did not remember His power,
PSA.78.42	The day when He redeemed them from the adversary,
PSA.78.43	When He performed His signs in Egypt
PSA.78.43	And His marvels in the field of Zoan,
PSA.78.44	And turned their rivers to blood,
PSA.78.44	And their streams, they could not drink.
PSA.78.45	He sent among them swarms of flies which devoured them,
PSA.78.45	And frogs which destroyed them.
PSA.78.46	He gave also their crops to the grasshopper
PSA.78.46	And the product of their labor to the locust.
PSA.78.47	He destroyed their vines with hailstones
PSA.78.47	And their sycamore trees with frost.
PSA.78.48	He gave over their cattle also to the hailstones
PSA.78.48	And their herds to bolts of lightning.
PSA.78.49	He sent upon them His burning anger,
PSA.78.49	Fury and indignation and trouble,
PSA.78.49	A band of destroying angels.
PSA.78.50	He leveled a path for His anger;
PSA.78.50	He did not spare their soul from death,
PSA.78.50	But gave over their life to the plague,
PSA.78.51	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt,
PSA.78.51	The first 
PSA.78.52	But He led forth His own people like sheep
PSA.78.52	And guided them in the wilderness like a flock;
PSA.78.53	He led them safely, so that they did not fear;
PSA.78.53	But the sea engulfed their enemies.
PSA.78.54	So He brought them to His holy land,
PSA.78.54	To this hill country which His right hand had gained.
PSA.78.55	He also drove out the nations before them
PSA.78.55	And apportioned them for an inheritance by measurement,
PSA.78.55	And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.
PSA.78.56	Yet they 
PSA.78.56	And did not keep His testimonies,
PSA.78.57	But turned back and acted treacherously like their fathers;
PSA.78.57	They turned aside like a treacherous bow.
PSA.78.58	For they provoked Him with their high places
PSA.78.58	And aroused His jealousy with their graven images.
PSA.78.59	When God heard, He was filled with wrath
PSA.78.59	And greatly abhorred Israel;
PSA.78.60	So that He abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh,
PSA.78.60	The tent which He had pitched among men,
PSA.78.61	And gave up His strength to captivity
PSA.78.61	And His glory into the hand of the adversary.
PSA.78.62	He also delivered His people to the sword,
PSA.78.62	And was filled with wrath at His inheritance.
PSA.78.63	Fire devoured His young men,
PSA.78.63	And His virgins had no wedding songs.
PSA.78.64	His priests fell by the sword,
PSA.78.64	And His widows could not weep.
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord awoke as 
PSA.78.65	Like a warrior overcome by wine.
PSA.78.66	He drove His adversaries backward;
PSA.78.66	He put on them an everlasting reproach.
PSA.78.67	He also rejected the tent of Joseph,
PSA.78.67	And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,
PSA.78.68	But chose the tribe of Judah,
PSA.78.68	Mount Zion which He loved.
PSA.78.69	And He built His sanctuary like the heights,
PSA.78.69	Like the earth which He has founded forever.
PSA.78.70	He also chose David His servant
PSA.78.70	And took him from the sheepfolds;
PSA.78.71	From the care of the ewes with suckling lambs He brought him
PSA.78.71	To shepherd Jacob His people,
PSA.78.71	And Israel His inheritance.
PSA.78.72	So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart,
PSA.78.72	And guided them with his skillful hands.
PSA.79.1	O God, the nations have invaded Your inheritance;
PSA.79.1	They have defiled Your holy temple;
PSA.79.1	They have laid Jerusalem in ruins.
PSA.79.2	They have given the dead bodies of Your servants for food to the birds of the heavens,
PSA.79.2	The flesh of Your godly ones to the beasts of the earth.
PSA.79.3	They have poured out their blood like water round about Jerusalem;
PSA.79.3	And there was no one to bury them.
PSA.79.4	We have become a reproach to our neighbors,
PSA.79.4	A scoffing and derision to those around us.
PSA.79.5	How long, O L
PSA.79.5	Will Your jealousy burn like fire?
PSA.79.6	Pour out Your wrath upon the nations which do not know You,
PSA.79.6	And upon the kingdoms which do not call upon Your name.
PSA.79.7	For they have devoured Jacob
PSA.79.7	And laid waste his habitation.
PSA.79.8	Do not remember the iniquities of 
PSA.79.8	Let Your compassion come quickly to meet us,
PSA.79.8	For we are brought very low.
PSA.79.9	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name;
PSA.79.9	And deliver us and forgive our sins for Your name’s sake.
PSA.79.10	Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”
PSA.79.10	Let there be known among the nations in our sight,
PSA.79.10	Vengeance for the blood of Your servants which has been shed.
PSA.79.11	Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You;
PSA.79.11	According to the greatness of Your power preserve those who are doomed to die.
PSA.79.12	And return to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom
PSA.79.12	The reproach with which they have reproached You, O Lord.
PSA.79.13	So we Your people and the sheep of Your pasture
PSA.79.13	Will give thanks to You forever;
PSA.79.13	To all generations we will tell of Your praise.
PSA.80.1	Oh, give ear, Shepherd of Israel,
PSA.80.1	You who lead Joseph like a flock;
PSA.80.1	You who are enthroned 
PSA.80.2	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Your power
PSA.80.2	And come to save us!
PSA.80.3	O God, restore us
PSA.80.3	And cause Your face to shine 
PSA.80.4	O L
PSA.80.4	How long will You be angry with the prayer of Your people?
PSA.80.5	You have fed them with the bread of tears,
PSA.80.5	And You have made them to drink tears in large measure.
PSA.80.6	You make us 
PSA.80.6	And our enemies laugh among themselves.
PSA.80.7	O God 
PSA.80.7	And cause Your face to shine 
PSA.80.8	You removed a vine from Egypt;
PSA.80.8	You drove out the nations and planted it.
PSA.80.9	You cleared 
PSA.80.9	And it took deep root and filled the land.
PSA.80.10	The mountains were covered with its shadow,
PSA.80.10	And the cedars of God with its boughs.
PSA.80.11	It was sending out its branches to the sea
PSA.80.11	And its shoots to the River.
PSA.80.12	Why have You broken down its hedges,
PSA.80.12	So that all who pass 
PSA.80.13	A boar from the forest eats it away
PSA.80.13	And whatever moves in the field feeds on it.
PSA.80.14	O God 
PSA.80.14	Look down from heaven and see, and take care of this vine,
PSA.80.15	Even the shoot which Your right hand has planted,
PSA.80.15	And on the son whom You have strengthened for Yourself.
PSA.80.16	It is burned with fire, it is cut down;
PSA.80.16	They perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.
PSA.80.17	Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand,
PSA.80.17	Upon the son of man whom You made strong for Yourself.
PSA.80.18	Then we shall not turn back from You;
PSA.80.18	Revive us, and we will call upon Your name.
PSA.80.19	O L
PSA.80.19	Cause Your face to shine 
PSA.81.1	Sing for joy to God our strength;
PSA.81.1	Shout joyfully to the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.2	Raise a song, strike the timbrel,
PSA.81.2	The sweet sounding lyre with the harp.
PSA.81.3	Blow the trumpet at the new moon,
PSA.81.3	At the full moon, on our feast day.
PSA.81.4	For it is a statute for Israel,
PSA.81.4	An ordinance of the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	He established it for a testimony in Joseph
PSA.81.5	When he went throughout the land of Egypt.
PSA.81.5	I heard a language that I did not know:
PSA.81.6	“I relieved his shoulder of the burden,
PSA.81.6	His hands were freed from the basket.
PSA.81.7	You called in trouble and I rescued you;
PSA.81.7	I answered you in the hiding place of thunder;
PSA.81.7	I proved you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
PSA.81.8	Hear, O My people, and I will admonish you;
PSA.81.8	O Israel, if you would listen to Me!
PSA.81.9	Let there be no strange god among you;
PSA.81.9	Nor shall you worship any foreign god.
PSA.81.10	I, the L
PSA.81.10	Who brought you up from the land of Egypt;
PSA.81.10	Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.
PSA.81.11	“But My people did not listen to My voice,
PSA.81.11	And Israel did not obey Me.
PSA.81.12	So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart,
PSA.81.12	To walk in their own devices.
PSA.81.13	Oh that My people would listen to Me,
PSA.81.13	That Israel would walk in My ways!
PSA.81.14	I would quickly subdue their enemies
PSA.81.14	And turn My hand against their adversaries.
PSA.81.15	Those who hate the L
PSA.81.15	And their time 
PSA.81.16	But I would feed you with the finest of the wheat,
PSA.81.16	And with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”
PSA.82.1	God takes His stand in His own congregation;
PSA.82.1	He judges in the midst of the rulers.
PSA.82.2	How long will you judge unjustly
PSA.82.2	And show partiality to the wicked? Selah.
PSA.82.3	Vindicate the weak and fatherless;
PSA.82.3	Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.
PSA.82.4	Rescue the weak and needy;
PSA.82.4	Deliver 
PSA.82.5	They do not know nor do they understand;
PSA.82.5	They walk about in darkness;
PSA.82.5	All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
PSA.82.6	I said, “You are gods,
PSA.82.6	And all of you are sons of the Most High.
PSA.82.7	Nevertheless you will die like men
PSA.82.7	And fall like 
PSA.82.8	Arise, O God, judge the earth!
PSA.82.8	For it is You who possesses all the nations.
PSA.83.1	O God, do not remain quiet;
PSA.83.1	Do not be silent and, O God, do not be still.
PSA.83.2	For behold, Your enemies make an uproar,
PSA.83.2	And those who hate You have exalted themselves.
PSA.83.3	They make shrewd plans against Your people,
PSA.83.3	And conspire together against Your treasured ones.
PSA.83.4	They have said, “Come, and let us wipe them out as a nation,
PSA.83.4	That the name of Israel be remembered no more.”
PSA.83.5	For they have conspired together with one mind;
PSA.83.5	Against You they make a covenant:
PSA.83.6	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
PSA.83.6	Moab and the Hagrites;
PSA.83.7	Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
PSA.83.7	Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
PSA.83.8	Assyria also has joined with them;
PSA.83.8	They have become a help to the children of Lot. Selah.
PSA.83.9	Deal with them as with Midian,
PSA.83.9	As with Sisera 
PSA.83.10	Who were destroyed at En-dor,
PSA.83.10	Who became as dung for the ground.
PSA.83.11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb
PSA.83.11	And all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
PSA.83.12	Who said, “Let us possess for ourselves
PSA.83.12	The pastures of God.”
PSA.83.13	O my God, make them like the 
PSA.83.13	Like chaff before the wind.
PSA.83.14	Like fire that burns the forest
PSA.83.14	And like a flame that sets the mountains on fire,
PSA.83.15	So pursue them with Your tempest
PSA.83.15	And terrify them with Your storm.
PSA.83.16	Fill their faces with dishonor,
PSA.83.16	That they may seek Your name, O L
PSA.83.17	Let them be ashamed and dismayed forever,
PSA.83.17	And let them be humiliated and perish,
PSA.83.18	That they may know that You alone, whose name is the L
PSA.83.18	Are the Most High over all the earth.
PSA.84.1	How lovely are Your dwelling places,
PSA.84.1	O L
PSA.84.2	My soul longed and even yearned for the courts of the L
PSA.84.2	My heart and my flesh sing for joy to the living God.
PSA.84.3	The bird also has found a house,
PSA.84.3	And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young,
PSA.84.3	Even Your altars, O L
PSA.84.3	My King and my God.
PSA.84.4	How blessed are those who dwell in Your house!
PSA.84.4	They are ever praising You. Selah.
PSA.84.5	How blessed is the man whose strength is in You,
PSA.84.5	In whose heart are the highways 
PSA.84.6	Passing through the valley of 
PSA.84.6	The early rain also covers it with blessings.
PSA.84.7	They go from strength to strength,
PSA.84.8	O L
PSA.84.8	Give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah.
PSA.84.9	Behold our shield, O God,
PSA.84.9	And look upon the face of Your anointed.
PSA.84.10	For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand 
PSA.84.10	I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God
PSA.84.10	Than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
PSA.84.11	For the L
PSA.84.11	The L
PSA.84.11	No good thing does He withhold from those who walk uprightly.
PSA.84.12	O L
PSA.84.12	How blessed is the man who trusts in You!
PSA.85.1	O L
PSA.85.1	You 
PSA.85.2	You forgave the iniquity of Your people;
PSA.85.2	You covered all their sin. Selah.
PSA.85.3	You withdrew all Your fury;
PSA.85.3	You turned away from Your burning anger.
PSA.85.4	Restore us, O God of our salvation,
PSA.85.4	And cause Your indignation toward us to cease.
PSA.85.5	Will You be angry with us forever?
PSA.85.5	Will You prolong Your anger to all generations?
PSA.85.6	Will You not Yourself revive us again,
PSA.85.6	That Your people may rejoice in You?
PSA.85.7	Show us Your lovingkindness, O L
PSA.85.7	And grant us Your salvation.
PSA.85.8	I will hear what God the L
PSA.85.8	For He will speak peace to His people, to His godly ones;
PSA.85.8	But let them not turn back to folly.
PSA.85.9	Surely His salvation is near to those who 
PSA.85.9	That glory may dwell in our land.
PSA.85.10	Lovingkindness and truth have met together;
PSA.85.10	Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
PSA.85.11	Truth springs from the earth,
PSA.85.11	And righteousness looks down from heaven.
PSA.85.12	Indeed, the L
PSA.85.12	And our land will yield its produce.
PSA.85.13	Righteousness will go before Him
PSA.85.13	And will make His footsteps into a way.
PSA.86.1	Incline Your ear, O L
PSA.86.1	For I am afflicted and needy.
PSA.86.2	Preserve my soul, for I am a godly man;
PSA.86.2	O You my God, save Your servant who trusts in You.
PSA.86.3	Be gracious to me, O Lord,
PSA.86.3	For to You I cry all day long.
PSA.86.4	Make glad the soul of Your servant,
PSA.86.4	For to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
PSA.86.5	For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive,
PSA.86.5	And abundant in lovingkindness to all who call upon You.
PSA.86.6	Give ear, O L
PSA.86.6	And give heed to the voice of my supplications!
PSA.86.7	In the day of my trouble I shall call upon You,
PSA.86.7	For You will answer me.
PSA.86.8	There is no one like You among the gods, O Lord,
PSA.86.8	Nor are there any works like Yours.
PSA.86.9	All nations whom You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord,
PSA.86.9	And they shall glorify Your name.
PSA.86.10	For You are great and do wondrous deeds;
PSA.86.10	You alone are God.
PSA.86.11	Teach me Your way, O L
PSA.86.11	I will walk in Your truth;
PSA.86.11	Unite my heart to fear Your name.
PSA.86.12	I will give thanks to You, O Lord my God, with all my heart,
PSA.86.12	And will glorify Your name forever.
PSA.86.13	For Your lovingkindness toward me is great,
PSA.86.13	And You have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.
PSA.86.14	O God, arrogant men have risen up against me,
PSA.86.14	And a band of violent men have sought my life,
PSA.86.14	And they have not set You before them.
PSA.86.15	But You, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious,
PSA.86.15	Slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness and truth.
PSA.86.16	Turn to me, and be gracious to me;
PSA.86.16	Oh grant Your strength to Your servant,
PSA.86.16	And save the son of Your handmaid.
PSA.86.17	Show me a sign for good,
PSA.86.17	That those who hate me may see 
PSA.86.17	Because You, O L
PSA.87.1	His foundation is in the holy mountains.
PSA.87.2	The L
PSA.87.2	More than all the 
PSA.87.3	Glorious things are spoken of you,
PSA.87.3	O city of God. Selah.
PSA.87.4	“I shall mention 
PSA.87.4	Behold, Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia:
PSA.87.4	‘This one was born there.’ ”
PSA.87.5	But of Zion it shall be said, “This one and that one were born in her”;
PSA.87.5	And the Most High Himself will establish her.
PSA.87.6	The L
PSA.87.6	“This one was born there.” Selah.
PSA.87.7	Then those who sing as well as those who play the flutes 
PSA.87.7	“All my springs 
PSA.88.1	O L
PSA.88.1	I have cried out by day and in the night before You.
PSA.88.2	Let my prayer come before You;
PSA.88.2	Incline Your ear to my cry!
PSA.88.3	For my soul has had enough troubles,
PSA.88.3	And my life has drawn near to Sheol.
PSA.88.4	I am reckoned among those who go down to the pit;
PSA.88.4	I have become like a man without strength,
PSA.88.5	Forsaken among the dead,
PSA.88.5	Like the slain who lie in the grave,
PSA.88.5	Whom You remember no more,
PSA.88.5	And they are cut off from Your hand.
PSA.88.6	You have put me in the lowest pit,
PSA.88.6	In dark places, in the depths.
PSA.88.7	Your wrath has rested upon me,
PSA.88.7	And You have afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah.
PSA.88.8	You have removed my acquaintances far from me;
PSA.88.8	You have made me an 
PSA.88.8	I am shut up and cannot go out.
PSA.88.9	My eye has wasted away because of affliction;
PSA.88.9	I have called upon You every day, O L
PSA.88.9	I have spread out my hands to You.
PSA.88.10	Will You perform wonders for the dead?
PSA.88.10	Will the departed spirits rise 
PSA.88.11	Will Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave,
PSA.88.11	Your faithfulness in Abaddon?
PSA.88.12	Will Your wonders be made known in the darkness?
PSA.88.12	And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
PSA.88.13	But I, O L
PSA.88.13	And in the morning my prayer comes before You.
PSA.88.14	O L
PSA.88.15	I was afflicted and about to die from my youth on;
PSA.88.15	I suffer Your terrors; I am overcome.
PSA.88.16	Your burning anger has passed over me;
PSA.88.16	Your terrors have destroyed me.
PSA.88.17	They have surrounded me like water all day long;
PSA.88.17	They have encompassed me altogether.
PSA.88.18	You have removed lover and friend far from me;
PSA.88.18	My acquaintances are 
PSA.89.1	I will sing of the lovingkindness of the L
PSA.89.1	To all generations I will make known Your faithfulness with my mouth.
PSA.89.2	For I have said, “Lovingkindness will be built up forever;
PSA.89.2	In the heavens You will establish Your faithfulness.”
PSA.89.3	“I have made a covenant with My chosen;
PSA.89.3	I have sworn to David My servant,
PSA.89.4	I will establish your seed forever
PSA.89.4	And build up your throne to all generations.” Selah.
PSA.89.5	The heavens will praise Your wonders, O L
PSA.89.5	Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.
PSA.89.6	For who in the skies is comparable to the L
PSA.89.6	Who among the sons of the mighty is like the L
PSA.89.7	A God greatly feared in the council of the holy ones,
PSA.89.7	And awesome above all those who are around Him?
PSA.89.8	O L
PSA.89.8	Your faithfulness also surrounds You.
PSA.89.9	You rule the swelling of the sea;
PSA.89.9	When its waves rise, You still them.
PSA.89.10	You Yourself crushed Rahab like one who is slain;
PSA.89.10	You scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.
PSA.89.11	The heavens are Yours, the earth also is Yours;
PSA.89.11	The world and 
PSA.89.12	The north and the south, You have created them;
PSA.89.12	Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Your name.
PSA.89.13	You have a strong arm;
PSA.89.13	Your hand is mighty, Your right hand is exalted.
PSA.89.14	Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne;
PSA.89.14	Lovingkindness and truth go before You.
PSA.89.15	How blessed are the people who know the 
PSA.89.15	O L
PSA.89.16	In Your name they rejoice all the day,
PSA.89.16	And by Your righteousness they are exalted.
PSA.89.17	For You are the glory of their strength,
PSA.89.17	And by Your favor our horn is exalted.
PSA.89.18	For our shield belongs to the L
PSA.89.19	Once You spoke in vision to Your godly ones,
PSA.89.19	And said, “I have given help to one who is mighty;
PSA.89.19	I have exalted one chosen from the people.
PSA.89.20	I have found David My servant;
PSA.89.20	With My holy oil I have anointed him,
PSA.89.21	With whom My hand will be established;
PSA.89.21	My arm also will strengthen him.
PSA.89.22	The enemy will not 
PSA.89.22	Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
PSA.89.23	But I shall crush his adversaries before him,
PSA.89.23	And strike those who hate him.
PSA.89.24	My faithfulness and My lovingkindness will be with him,
PSA.89.24	And in My name his horn will be exalted.
PSA.89.25	I shall also set his hand on the sea
PSA.89.25	And his right hand on the rivers.
PSA.89.26	He will cry to Me, ‘You are my Father,
PSA.89.26	My God, and the rock of my salvation.’
PSA.89.27	I also shall make him 
PSA.89.27	The highest of the kings of the earth.
PSA.89.28	My lovingkindness I will keep for him forever,
PSA.89.28	And My covenant shall be confirmed to him.
PSA.89.29	So I will establish his descendants forever
PSA.89.29	And his throne as the days of heaven.
PSA.89.30	“If his sons forsake My law
PSA.89.30	And do not walk in My judgments,
PSA.89.31	If they 
PSA.89.31	And do not keep My commandments,
PSA.89.32	Then I will punish their transgression with the rod
PSA.89.32	And their iniquity with stripes.
PSA.89.33	But I will not break off My lovingkindness from him,
PSA.89.33	Nor deal falsely in My faithfulness.
PSA.89.34	My covenant I will not violate,
PSA.89.34	Nor will I alter the utterance of My lips.
PSA.89.35	I will not lie to David.
PSA.89.36	His descendants shall endure forever
PSA.89.36	And his throne as the sun before Me.
PSA.89.37	It shall be established forever like the moon,
PSA.89.37	And the witness in the sky is faithful.” Selah.
PSA.89.38	But You have cast off and rejected,
PSA.89.38	You have been full of wrath against Your anointed.
PSA.89.39	You have spurned the covenant of Your servant;
PSA.89.39	You have profaned his crown in the dust.
PSA.89.40	You have broken down all his walls;
PSA.89.40	You have brought his strongholds to ruin.
PSA.89.41	All who pass along the way plunder him;
PSA.89.41	He has become a reproach to his neighbors.
PSA.89.42	You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries;
PSA.89.42	You have made all his enemies rejoice.
PSA.89.43	You also turn back the edge of his sword
PSA.89.43	And have not made him stand in battle.
PSA.89.44	You have made his splendor to cease
PSA.89.44	And cast his throne to the ground.
PSA.89.45	You have shortened the days of his youth;
PSA.89.45	You have covered him with shame. Selah.
PSA.89.46	How long, O L
PSA.89.46	Will You hide Yourself forever?
PSA.89.46	Will Your wrath burn like fire?
PSA.89.47	Remember what my span of life is;
PSA.89.47	For what vanity You have created all the sons of men!
PSA.89.48	What man can live and not see death?
PSA.89.48	Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah.
PSA.89.49	Where are Your former lovingkindnesses, O Lord,
PSA.89.49	Which You swore to David in Your faithfulness?
PSA.89.50	Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants;
PSA.89.50	How I bear in my bosom 
PSA.89.51	With which Your enemies have reproached, O L
PSA.89.51	With which they have reproached the footsteps of Your anointed.
PSA.89.52	Blessed be the L
PSA.89.52	Amen and Amen.
PSA.90.1	Lord, You have been our 
PSA.90.2	Before the mountains were born
PSA.90.2	Or You gave birth to the earth and the world,
PSA.90.2	Even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.
PSA.90.3	You turn man back into dust
PSA.90.3	And say, “Return, O children of men.”
PSA.90.4	For a thousand years in Your sight
PSA.90.4	Are like yesterday when it passes by,
PSA.90.4	Or 
PSA.90.5	You have swept them away like a flood, they fall asleep;
PSA.90.5	In the morning they are like grass which sprouts anew.
PSA.90.6	In the morning it flourishes and sprouts anew;
PSA.90.6	Toward evening it fades and withers away.
PSA.90.7	For we have been consumed by Your anger
PSA.90.7	And by Your wrath we have been dismayed.
PSA.90.8	You have placed our iniquities before You,
PSA.90.8	Our secret 
PSA.90.9	For all our days have declined in Your fury;
PSA.90.9	We have finished our years like a sigh.
PSA.90.10	As for the days of our life, they contain seventy years,
PSA.90.10	Or if due to strength, eighty years,
PSA.90.10	Yet their pride is 
PSA.90.10	For soon it is gone and we fly away.
PSA.90.11	Who understands the power of Your anger
PSA.90.11	And Your fury, according to the fear that is due You?
PSA.90.12	So teach us to number our days,
PSA.90.12	That we may present to You a heart of wisdom.
PSA.90.13	Do return, O L
PSA.90.13	And be sorry for Your servants.
PSA.90.14	O satisfy us in the morning with Your lovingkindness,
PSA.90.14	That we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.
PSA.90.15	Make us glad according to the days You have afflicted us,
PSA.90.16	Let Your work appear to Your servants
PSA.90.16	And Your majesty to their children.
PSA.90.17	Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us;
PSA.90.17	And 
PSA.90.17	Yes, confirm the work of our hands.
PSA.91.1	He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High
PSA.91.1	Will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
PSA.91.2	I will say to the L
PSA.91.2	My God, in whom I trust!”
PSA.91.3	For it is He who delivers you from the snare of the trapper
PSA.91.3	And from the deadly pestilence.
PSA.91.4	He will cover you with His pinions,
PSA.91.4	And under His wings you may seek refuge;
PSA.91.4	His faithfulness is a shield and bulwark.
PSA.91.5	You will not be afraid of the terror by night,
PSA.91.5	Or of the arrow that flies by day;
PSA.91.6	Of the pestilence that stalks in darkness,
PSA.91.6	Or of the destruction that lays waste at noon.
PSA.91.7	A thousand may fall at your side
PSA.91.7	And ten thousand at your right hand,
PSA.91.8	You will only look on with your eyes
PSA.91.8	And see the recompense of the wicked.
PSA.91.9	For you have made the L
PSA.91.10	No evil will befall you,
PSA.91.10	Nor will any plague come near your tent.
PSA.91.11	For He will give His angels charge concerning you,
PSA.91.11	To guard you in all your ways.
PSA.91.12	They will bear you up in their hands,
PSA.91.12	That you do not strike your foot against a stone.
PSA.91.13	You will tread upon the lion and cobra,
PSA.91.13	The young lion and the serpent you will trample down.
PSA.91.14	“Because he has loved Me, therefore I will deliver him;
PSA.91.14	I will set him 
PSA.91.15	He will call upon Me, and I will answer him;
PSA.91.15	I will be with him in trouble;
PSA.91.15	I will rescue him and honor him.
PSA.91.16	With a long life I will satisfy him
PSA.91.16	And let him see My salvation.”
PSA.92.1	It is good to give thanks to the L
PSA.92.1	And to sing praises to Your name, O Most High;
PSA.92.2	To declare Your lovingkindness in the morning
PSA.92.2	And Your faithfulness by night,
PSA.92.3	With the ten-stringed lute and with the harp,
PSA.92.3	With resounding music upon the lyre.
PSA.92.4	For You, O L
PSA.92.4	I will sing for joy at the works of Your hands.
PSA.92.5	How great are Your works, O L
PSA.92.5	Your thoughts are very deep.
PSA.92.6	A senseless man has no knowledge,
PSA.92.6	Nor does a stupid man understand this:
PSA.92.7	That when the wicked sprouted up like grass
PSA.92.7	And all who did iniquity flourished,
PSA.92.7	It 
PSA.92.8	But You, O L
PSA.92.9	For, behold, Your enemies, O L
PSA.92.9	For, behold, Your enemies will perish;
PSA.92.9	All who do iniquity will be scattered.
PSA.92.10	But You have exalted my horn like 
PSA.92.10	I have been anointed with fresh oil.
PSA.92.11	And my eye has looked 
PSA.92.11	My ears hear of the evildoers who rise up against me.
PSA.92.12	The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree,
PSA.92.12	He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
PSA.92.13	Planted in the house of the L
PSA.92.13	They will flourish in the courts of our God.
PSA.92.14	They will still yield fruit in old age;

PSA.93.4	More than the sounds of many waters,
PSA.93.4	The L
PSA.93.5	Your testimonies are fully confirmed;
PSA.93.5	Holiness befits Your house,
PSA.93.5	O L
PSA.94.1	O L
PSA.94.1	God of vengeance, shine forth!
PSA.94.2	Rise up, O Judge of the earth,
PSA.94.2	Render recompense to the proud.
PSA.94.3	How long shall the wicked, O L
PSA.94.3	How long shall the wicked exult?
PSA.94.4	They pour forth 
PSA.94.4	All who do wickedness vaunt themselves.
PSA.94.5	They crush Your people, O L
PSA.94.5	And afflict Your heritage.
PSA.94.6	They slay the widow and the stranger
PSA.94.6	And murder the orphans.
PSA.94.7	They have said, “The L
PSA.94.7	Nor does the God of Jacob pay heed.”
PSA.94.8	Pay heed, you senseless among the people;
PSA.94.8	And when will you understand, stupid ones?
PSA.94.9	He who planted the ear, does He not hear?
PSA.94.9	He who formed the eye, does He not see?
PSA.94.10	He who chastens the nations, will He not rebuke,
PSA.94.11	The L
PSA.94.11	That they are a 
PSA.94.12	Blessed is the man whom You chasten, O L
PSA.94.12	And whom You teach out of Your law;
PSA.94.13	That You may grant him relief from the days of adversity,
PSA.94.13	Until a pit is dug for the wicked.
PSA.94.14	For the L
PSA.94.14	Nor will He forsake His inheritance.
PSA.94.15	For judgment will again be righteous,
PSA.94.15	And all the upright in heart will follow it.
PSA.94.16	Who will stand up for me against evildoers?
PSA.94.16	Who will take his stand for me against those who do wickedness?
PSA.94.17	If the L
PSA.94.17	My soul would soon have dwelt in 
PSA.94.18	If I should say, “My foot has slipped,”
PSA.94.18	Your lovingkindness, O L
PSA.94.19	When my anxious thoughts multiply within me,
PSA.94.19	Your consolations delight my soul.
PSA.94.20	Can a throne of destruction be allied with You,
PSA.94.20	One which devises mischief by decree?
PSA.94.21	They band themselves together against the life of the righteous
PSA.94.21	And condemn the innocent to death.
PSA.94.22	But the L

PSA.95.4	In whose hand are the depths of the earth,
PSA.95.4	The peaks of the mountains are His also.
PSA.95.5	The sea is His, for it was He who made it,
PSA.95.5	And His hands formed the dry land.

PSA.95.7	For He is our God,
PSA.95.7	And we are the people of His pasture and the sheep of His hand.
PSA.95.7	Today, if you would hear His voice,
PSA.95.8	Do not harden your hearts, as at 
PSA.95.8	As in the day of 
PSA.95.9	“When your fathers tested Me,
PSA.95.9	They tried Me, though they had seen My work.
PSA.95.10	For forty years I loathed 
PSA.95.10	And said they are a people who err in their heart,
PSA.95.10	And they do not know My ways.

PSA.102.6	I resemble a pelican of the wilderness;
PSA.102.6	I have become like an owl of the waste places.

PSA.102.11	My days are like a lengthened shadow,

PSA.102.14	And feel pity for her dust.
PSA.102.15	So the nations will fear the name of the L
PSA.102.15	And all the kings of the earth Your glory.
PSA.102.16	For the L
PSA.102.16	He has appeared in His glory.
PSA.102.17	He has regarded the prayer of the destitute
PSA.102.17	And has not despised their prayer.
PSA.102.18	This will be written for the generation to come,
PSA.102.18	That a people yet to be created may praise the L
PSA.102.19	For He looked down from His holy height;
PSA.102.19	From heaven the L
PSA.102.20	To hear the groaning of the prisoner,
PSA.102.20	To set free those who were doomed to death,
PSA.102.21	That

PSA.102.22	When the peoples are gathered together,
PSA.102.22	And the kingdoms, to serve the L
PSA.102.23	He has weakened my strength in the way;
PSA.102.23	He has shortened my days.
PSA.102.24	I say, “O my God, do not take me away in the midst of my days,
PSA.102.24	Your years are throughout all generations.
PSA.102.25	Of old You founded the earth,
PSA.102.25	And the heavens are the work of Your hands.
PSA.102.26	Even they will perish, but You endure;
PSA.102.26	And all of them will wear out like a garment;
PSA.102.26	Like clothing You will change them and they will be changed.
PSA.102.27	But You are the same,
PSA.102.27	And Your years will not come to an end.
PSA.102.28	The children of Your servants will continue,
PSA.102.28	And their descendants will be established before You.”

PSA.103.5	Who satisfies your

PSA.103.6	And judgments for all who are oppressed.
PSA.103.7	He made known His ways to Moses,
PSA.103.7	His acts to the sons of Israel.
PSA.103.8	The L
PSA.103.8	Slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness.
PSA.103.9	He will not always strive 
PSA.103.9	Nor will He keep 
PSA.103.10	He has not dealt with us according to our sins,
PSA.103.10	Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
PSA.103.11	For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
PSA.103.11	So great is His lovingkindness toward those who 
PSA.103.12	As far as the east is from the west,
PSA.103.12	So far has He removed our transgressions from us.
PSA.103.13	Just as a father has compassion on 
PSA.103.13	So the L
PSA.103.14	For He Himself knows 
PSA.103.14	He is mindful that we are

PSA.104.3	He makes the clouds His chariot;
PSA.104.3	He walks upon the wings of the wind;
PSA.104.4	He makes 
PSA.104.5	He established the earth upon its foundations,
PSA.104.5	So that it will not 
PSA.104.6	You covered it with the deep as with a garment;
PSA.104.6	The waters were standing above the mountains.
PSA.104.7	At Your rebuke they fled,
PSA.104.7	At the sound of Your thunder they hurried away.
PSA.104.8	The mountains rose; the valleys sank down
PSA.104.8	To the place which You established for them.
PSA.104.9	You set a boundary that they may not pass over,
PSA.104.9	So that they will not return to cover the earth.
PSA.104.10	He sends forth springs in the valleys;
PSA.104.10	They flow between the mountains;
PSA.104.11	They give drink to every beast of the field;
PSA.104.11	The wild donkeys quench their thirst.
PSA.104.12	Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell;
PSA.104.12	They lift up 
PSA.104.13	He waters the mountains from His upper chambers;
PSA.104.13	The earth is satisfied with the fruit of His works.
PSA.104.14	He causes the grass to grow for the cattle,
PSA.104.14	And vegetation for the labor of man,
PSA.104.14	So that he may bring forth food from the earth,
PSA.104.15	And wine which makes man’s heart glad,
PSA.104.15	So that he may make 
PSA.104.15	And food which sustains man’s heart.
PSA.104.16	The trees of the L
PSA.104.16	The cedars of Lebanon which He planted,
PSA.104.17	Where the birds build their nests,
PSA.104.18	The high mountains are for the wild goats;
PSA.104.18	The cliffs are a refuge for the shephanim.
PSA.104.19	He made the moon for the seasons;
PSA.104.19	The sun knows the place of its setting.
PSA.104.20	You appoint darkness and it becomes night,
PSA.104.20	In which all the beasts of the forest prowl about.
PSA.104.21	The young lions roar after their prey
PSA.104.21	And seek their food from God.
PSA.104.22	And lie down in their dens.
PSA.104.23	Man goes forth to his work
PSA.104.23	And to his labor until evening.
PSA.104.24	O L
PSA.104.24	In wisdom You have made them all;
PSA.104.24	The earth is full of Your 
PSA.104.25	There is the sea, great and broad,
PSA.104.25	In which are swarms without number,
PSA.104.25	Animals both small and great.
PSA.104.26	There the ships move along,
PSA.104.27	They all wait for You
PSA.104.27	To give them their food in 
PSA.104.28	You give to them, they gather 
PSA.104.28	You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good.
PSA.104.29	You hide Your face, they are dismayed;
PSA.104.29	You take away their 
PSA.104.29	And return to their dust.
PSA.104.30	You send forth Your

PSA.104.31	Let the glory of the L
PSA.104.31	Let the L
PSA.104.32	He looks at the earth, and it trembles;
PSA.104.32	He touches the mountains, and they smoke.
PSA.104.33	I will sing to the L
PSA.104.33	I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
PSA.104.34	Let my meditation be pleasing to Him;
PSA.104.34	As for me, I shall be glad in the L
PSA.104.35	Let sinners be consumed from the earth
PSA.104.35	And let the wicked be no more.
PSA.104.35	Bless the L
PSA.104.35	Praise the L
PSA.105.1	Oh give thanks to the L
PSA.105.1	Make known His deeds among the peoples.
PSA.105.2	Sing to Him, sing praises to Him;
PSA.105.3	Glory in His holy name;
PSA.105.3	Let the heart of those who seek the L
PSA.105.4	Seek the L
PSA.105.4	Seek His face continually.
PSA.105.5	Remember His wonders which He has done,
PSA.105.5	His marvels and the judgments uttered by His mouth,
PSA.105.6	O seed of Abraham, His servant,
PSA.105.6	O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones!
PSA.105.7	He is the L
PSA.105.7	His judgments are in all the earth.
PSA.105.8	He has remembered His covenant forever,
PSA.105.8	The word which He commanded to a thousand generations,
PSA.105.9	And His oath to Isaac.
PSA.105.10	Then He confirmed it to Jacob for a statute,
PSA.105.10	To Israel as an everlasting covenant,
PSA.105.11	Saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan
PSA.105.11	As the portion of your inheritance,”
PSA.105.12	When they were only a few men in number,
PSA.105.12	Very few, and strangers in it.
PSA.105.13	And they wandered about from nation to nation,
PSA.105.13	From 
PSA.105.14	He permitted no man to oppress them,
PSA.105.14	And He reproved kings for their sakes:
PSA.105.15	“Do not touch My anointed ones,
PSA.105.15	And do My prophets no harm.”
PSA.105.16	And He called for a famine upon the land;
PSA.105.16	He broke the whole staff of bread.
PSA.105.17	He sent a man before them,
PSA.105.17	Joseph, 
PSA.105.18	They afflicted his feet with fetters,
PSA.105.18	He himself was laid in irons;
PSA.105.19	Until the time that his word came to pass,
PSA.105.19	The word of the L
PSA.105.20	The king sent and released him,
PSA.105.20	The ruler of peoples, and set him free.
PSA.105.21	He made him lord of his house
PSA.105.21	And ruler over all his possessions,
PSA.105.22	To imprison his princes at will,
PSA.105.22	That he might teach his elders wisdom.
PSA.105.23	Israel also came into Egypt;
PSA.105.23	Thus Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.24	And He caused His people to be very fruitful,
PSA.105.24	And made them stronger than their adversaries.
PSA.105.25	He turned their heart to hate His people,
PSA.105.25	To deal craftily with His servants.
PSA.105.26	He sent Moses His servant,
PSA.105.27	They performed His wondrous acts among them,
PSA.105.27	And miracles in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.28	He sent darkness and made 
PSA.105.28	And they did not rebel against His words.
PSA.105.29	He turned their waters into blood
PSA.105.29	And caused their fish to die.
PSA.105.30	Their land swarmed with frogs
PSA.105.31	He spoke, and there came a swarm of flies
PSA.105.32	He gave them hail for rain,
PSA.105.33	He struck down their vines also and their fig trees,
PSA.105.33	And shattered the trees of their territory.
PSA.105.34	He spoke, and locusts came,
PSA.105.34	And young locusts, even without number,
PSA.105.35	And ate up all vegetation in their land,
PSA.105.35	And ate up the fruit of their ground.
PSA.105.36	He also struck down all the firstborn in their land,
PSA.105.36	The first fruits of all their vigor.
PSA.105.37	Then He brought them out with silver and gold,
PSA.105.37	And among His tribes there was not one who stumbled.
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when they departed,
PSA.105.38	For the dread of them had fallen upon them.
PSA.105.39	He spread a cloud for a 
PSA.105.39	And fire to illumine by night.
PSA.105.40	They asked, and He brought quail,
PSA.105.40	And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
PSA.105.41	He opened the rock and water flowed out;
PSA.105.41	It ran in the dry places 
PSA.105.42	For He remembered His holy word
PSA.105.43	And He brought forth His people with joy,
PSA.105.43	His chosen ones with a joyful shout.
PSA.105.44	He gave them also the lands of the nations,
PSA.105.44	That they might take possession of 
PSA.105.45	So that they might keep His statutes
PSA.105.45	And observe His laws,
PSA.105.45	Praise the L
PSA.106.1	Praise the L
PSA.106.1	Oh give thanks to the L
PSA.106.1	For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
PSA.106.2	Who can speak of the mighty deeds of the L
PSA.106.2	Or can show forth all His praise?
PSA.106.3	How blessed are those who keep justice,
PSA.106.3	Who practice righteousness at all times!
PSA.106.4	Remember me, O L
PSA.106.4	Visit me with Your salvation,
PSA.106.5	That I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones,
PSA.106.5	That I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation,
PSA.106.5	That I may glory with Your 
PSA.106.6	We have sinned like our fathers,
PSA.106.6	We have committed iniquity, we have behaved wickedly.
PSA.106.7	Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders;
PSA.106.7	They did not remember Your abundant kindnesses,
PSA.106.7	But rebelled by the sea, at the 
PSA.106.8	Nevertheless He saved them for the sake of His name,
PSA.106.8	That He might make His power known.
PSA.106.9	Thus He rebuked the 
PSA.106.9	And He led them through the deeps, as through the wilderness.
PSA.106.10	So He saved them from the hand of the one who hated 
PSA.106.10	And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
PSA.106.11	The waters covered their adversaries;
PSA.106.11	Not one of them was left.
PSA.106.12	Then they believed His words;
PSA.106.12	They sang His praise.
PSA.106.13	They quickly forgot His works;
PSA.106.13	They did not wait for His counsel,
PSA.106.14	But craved intensely in the wilderness,
PSA.106.14	And tempted God in the desert.
PSA.106.15	So He gave them their request,
PSA.106.15	But sent a wasting disease among them.
PSA.106.16	When they became envious of Moses in the camp,
PSA.106.16	And of Aaron, the holy one of the L
PSA.106.17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
PSA.106.17	And engulfed the company of Abiram.
PSA.106.18	And a fire blazed up in their company;
PSA.106.18	The flame consumed the wicked.
PSA.106.19	They made a calf in Horeb
PSA.106.19	And worshiped a molten image.
PSA.106.20	Thus they exchanged their glory
PSA.106.20	For the image of an ox that eats grass.
PSA.106.21	They forgot God their Savior,
PSA.106.21	Who had done great things in Egypt,
PSA.106.22	Wonders in the land of Ham
PSA.106.23	Therefore He said that He would destroy them,
PSA.106.23	Had not Moses His chosen one stood in the breach before Him,
PSA.106.23	To turn away His wrath from destroying 
PSA.106.24	Then they despised the pleasant land;
PSA.106.24	They did not believe in His word,
PSA.106.25	But grumbled in their tents;
PSA.106.25	They did not listen to the voice of the L
PSA.106.26	Therefore He swore to them
PSA.106.26	That He would cast them down in the wilderness,
PSA.106.27	And that He would cast their seed among the nations
PSA.106.27	And scatter them in the lands.
PSA.106.28	They joined themselves also to Baal-peor,
PSA.106.28	And ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
PSA.106.29	Thus they provoked 
PSA.106.29	And the plague broke out among them.
PSA.106.30	Then Phinehas stood up and interposed,
PSA.106.30	And so the plague was stayed.
PSA.106.31	And it was reckoned to him for righteousness,
PSA.106.31	To all generations forever.
PSA.106.32	They also provoked 
PSA.106.32	So that it went hard with Moses on their account;
PSA.106.33	Because they were rebellious against His Spirit,
PSA.106.33	He spoke rashly with his lips.
PSA.106.34	They did not destroy the peoples,
PSA.106.34	As the L
PSA.106.35	But they mingled with the nations
PSA.106.35	And learned their practices,
PSA.106.36	And served their idols,
PSA.106.36	Which became a snare to them.
PSA.106.37	They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons,
PSA.106.38	And shed innocent blood,
PSA.106.38	The blood of their sons and their daughters,
PSA.106.38	Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan;
PSA.106.38	And the land was polluted with the blood.
PSA.106.39	Thus they became unclean in their practices,
PSA.106.39	And played the harlot in their deeds.
PSA.106.40	Therefore the anger of the L
PSA.106.40	And He abhorred His inheritance.
PSA.106.41	Then He gave them into the hand of the nations,
PSA.106.41	And those who hated them ruled over them.
PSA.106.42	Their enemies also oppressed them,
PSA.106.42	And they were subdued under their power.
PSA.106.43	Many times He would deliver them;
PSA.106.43	They, however, were rebellious in their counsel,
PSA.106.43	And 
PSA.106.44	Nevertheless He looked upon their distress
PSA.106.44	When He heard their cry;
PSA.106.45	And He remembered His covenant for their sake,
PSA.106.45	And relented according to the greatness of His lovingkindness.
PSA.106.46	He also made them 
PSA.106.46	In the presence of all their captors.
PSA.106.47	Save us, O L
PSA.106.47	And gather us from among the nations,
PSA.106.47	To give thanks to Your holy name
PSA.106.47	And glory in Your praise.
PSA.106.48	Blessed be the L
PSA.106.48	From everlasting even to everlasting.
PSA.106.48	And let all the people say, “Amen.”
PSA.106.48	Praise the L
PSA.107.1	Oh give thanks to the L
PSA.107.1	For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
PSA.107.2	Let the redeemed of the L
PSA.107.2	Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the adversary
PSA.107.3	And gathered from the lands,
PSA.107.3	From the east and from the west,
PSA.107.3	From the north and from the south.
PSA.107.4	They wandered in the wilderness in a desert region;
PSA.107.4	They did not find a way to an inhabited city.
PSA.107.5	Their soul fainted within them.
PSA.107.6	Then they cried out to the L
PSA.107.6	He delivered them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.7	He led them also by a straight way,
PSA.107.7	To go to an inhabited city.
PSA.107.8	Let them give thanks to the L
PSA.107.8	And for His wonders to the sons of men!
PSA.107.9	For He has satisfied the thirsty soul,
PSA.107.9	And the hungry soul He has filled with what is good.
PSA.107.10	There were those who dwelt in darkness and in the shadow of death,
PSA.107.10	Prisoners in misery and chains,
PSA.107.11	Because they had rebelled against the words of God
PSA.107.11	And spurned the counsel of the Most High.
PSA.107.12	Therefore He humbled their heart with labor;
PSA.107.12	They stumbled and there was none to help.
PSA.107.13	Then they cried out to the L
PSA.107.13	He saved them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death
PSA.107.14	And broke their bands apart.
PSA.107.15	Let them give thanks to the L
PSA.107.15	And for His wonders to the sons of men!
PSA.107.16	For He has shattered gates of bronze
PSA.107.16	And cut bars of iron asunder.
PSA.107.17	Fools, because of their rebellious way,
PSA.107.17	And because of their iniquities, were afflicted.
PSA.107.18	Their soul abhorred all kinds of food,
PSA.107.18	And they drew near to the gates of death.
PSA.107.19	Then they cried out to the L
PSA.107.19	He saved them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.20	He sent His word and healed them,
PSA.107.20	And delivered 
PSA.107.21	Let them give thanks to the L
PSA.107.21	And for His wonders to the sons of men!
PSA.107.22	Let them also offer sacrifices of thanksgiving,
PSA.107.22	And tell of His works with joyful singing.
PSA.107.23	Those who go down to the sea in ships,
PSA.107.23	Who do business on great waters;
PSA.107.24	They have seen the works of the L
PSA.107.24	And His wonders in the deep.
PSA.107.25	For He spoke and raised up a stormy wind,
PSA.107.25	Which lifted up the waves of the sea.
PSA.107.26	They rose up to the heavens, they went down to the depths;
PSA.107.26	Their soul melted away in 
PSA.107.27	They reeled and staggered like a drunken man,
PSA.107.27	And 
PSA.107.28	Then they cried to the L
PSA.107.28	And He brought them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.29	He caused the storm to be still,
PSA.107.29	So that the waves of the sea were hushed.
PSA.107.30	Then they were glad because they were quiet,
PSA.107.30	So He guided them to their desired haven.
PSA.107.31	Let them give thanks to the L
PSA.107.31	And for His wonders to the sons of men!
PSA.107.32	Let them extol Him also in the congregation of the people,
PSA.107.32	And praise Him at the seat of the elders.
PSA.107.33	He 
PSA.107.33	And springs of water into a thirsty ground;
PSA.107.34	A fruitful land into a salt waste,
PSA.107.34	Because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
PSA.107.35	He changes a wilderness into a pool of water
PSA.107.35	And a dry land into springs of water;
PSA.107.36	And there He makes the hungry to dwell,
PSA.107.36	So that they may establish an inhabited city,
PSA.107.37	And sow fields and plant vineyards,
PSA.107.37	And gather a fruitful harvest.
PSA.107.38	Also He blesses them and they multiply greatly,
PSA.107.38	And He does not let their cattle decrease.
PSA.107.39	When they are diminished and bowed down
PSA.107.39	Through oppression, misery and sorrow,
PSA.107.40	He pours contempt upon princes
PSA.107.40	And makes them wander in a pathless waste.
PSA.107.41	But He sets the needy securely on high away from affliction,
PSA.107.41	And makes 
PSA.107.42	The upright see it and are glad;
PSA.107.42	But all unrighteousness shuts its mouth.
PSA.107.43	Who is wise? Let him give heed to these things,
PSA.107.43	And consider the lovingkindnesses of the L
PSA.108.1	My heart is steadfast, O God;
PSA.108.1	I will sing, I will sing praises, even with my soul.
PSA.108.2	Awake, harp and lyre;
PSA.108.2	I will awaken the dawn!
PSA.108.3	I will give thanks to You, O L
PSA.108.3	And I will sing praises to You among the nations.
PSA.108.4	For Your lovingkindness is great above the heavens,
PSA.108.4	And Your truth 
PSA.108.5	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens,
PSA.108.5	And Your glory above all the earth.
PSA.108.6	That Your beloved may be delivered,
PSA.108.6	Save with Your right hand, and answer me!
PSA.108.7	God has spoken in His 
PSA.108.7	“I will exult, I will portion out Shechem
PSA.108.7	And measure out the valley of Succoth.
PSA.108.8	Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine;
PSA.108.8	Ephraim also is the helmet of My head;
PSA.108.8	Judah is My 
PSA.108.9	Moab is My washbowl;
PSA.108.9	Over Edom I shall throw My shoe;
PSA.108.9	Over Philistia I will shout aloud.”
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me into the besieged city?
PSA.108.10	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.108.11	Have not You Yourself, O God, rejected us?
PSA.108.11	And will You not go forth with our armies, O God?
PSA.108.12	Oh give us help against the adversary,
PSA.108.12	For deliverance by man is in vain.
PSA.108.13	Through God we will do valiantly,
PSA.108.13	And it is He who shall tread down our adversaries.
PSA.109.1	O God of my praise,
PSA.109.1	Do not be silent!
PSA.109.2	For they have opened the wicked and deceitful mouth against me;
PSA.109.2	They have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
PSA.109.3	They have also surrounded me with words of hatred,
PSA.109.3	And fought against me without cause.
PSA.109.4	In return for my love they act as my accusers;
PSA.109.4	But I am 
PSA.109.5	Thus they have repaid me evil for good
PSA.109.5	And hatred for my love.
PSA.109.6	Appoint a wicked man over him,
PSA.109.6	And let an accuser stand at his right hand.
PSA.109.7	When he is judged, let him come forth guilty,
PSA.109.7	And let his prayer become sin.
PSA.109.8	Let his days be few;
PSA.109.8	Let another take his office.
PSA.109.9	Let his children be fatherless
PSA.109.9	And his wife a widow.
PSA.109.10	Let his children wander about and beg;
PSA.109.10	And let them seek 
PSA.109.11	Let the creditor seize all that he has,
PSA.109.11	And let strangers plunder the product of his labor.
PSA.109.12	Let there be none to extend lovingkindness to him,
PSA.109.12	Nor any to be gracious to his fatherless children.
PSA.109.13	Let his posterity be cut off;
PSA.109.13	In a following generation let their name be blotted out.
PSA.109.14	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the L
PSA.109.14	And do not let the sin of his mother be blotted out.
PSA.109.15	Let them be before the L
PSA.109.15	That He may cut off their memory from the earth;
PSA.109.16	Because he did not remember to show lovingkindness,
PSA.109.16	But persecuted the afflicted and needy man,
PSA.109.16	And the despondent in heart, to put 
PSA.109.17	He also loved cursing, so it came to him;
PSA.109.17	And he did not delight in blessing, so it was far from him.
PSA.109.18	But he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment,
PSA.109.18	And it entered into his body like water
PSA.109.18	And like oil into his bones.
PSA.109.19	Let it be to him as a garment with which he covers himself,
PSA.109.19	And for a belt with which he constantly girds himself.
PSA.109.20	Let this be the reward of my accusers from the L
PSA.109.20	And of those who speak evil against my soul.
PSA.109.21	But You, O G
PSA.109.21	Because Your lovingkindness is good, deliver me;
PSA.109.22	For I am afflicted and needy,
PSA.109.22	And my heart is wounded within me.
PSA.109.23	I am passing like a shadow when it lengthens;
PSA.109.23	I am shaken off like the locust.
PSA.109.24	My knees are weak from fasting,
PSA.109.24	And my flesh has grown lean, without fatness.
PSA.109.25	I also have become a reproach to them;
PSA.109.25	When they see me, they wag their head.
PSA.109.26	Help me, O L
PSA.109.26	Save me according to Your lovingkindness.
PSA.109.27	And let them know that this is Your hand;
PSA.109.27	You, L
PSA.109.28	Let them curse, but You bless;
PSA.109.28	When they arise, they shall be ashamed,
PSA.109.28	But Your servant shall be glad.
PSA.109.29	Let my accusers be clothed with dishonor,
PSA.109.29	And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
PSA.109.30	With my mouth I will give thanks abundantly to the L
PSA.109.30	And in the midst of many I will praise Him.
PSA.109.31	For He stands at the right hand of the needy,
PSA.109.31	To save him from those who judge his soul.

PSA.119.69	The arrogant 
PSA.119.69	With all 
PSA.119.70	Their heart is covered with fat,
PSA.119.71	It is good for me that I was afflicted,
PSA.119.71	That I may learn Your statutes.
PSA.119.72	The law of Your mouth is better to me
PSA.119.72	Than thousands of gold and silver 
PSA.119.73	Your hands made me and 
PSA.119.73	Give me understanding, that I may learn Your commandments.
PSA.119.74	May those who fear You see me and be glad,
PSA.119.74	Because I wait for Your word.
PSA.119.75	I know, O L
PSA.119.75	And that in faithfulness You have afflicted me.
PSA.119.76	O may Your lovingkindness comfort me,
PSA.119.76	According to Your word to Your servant.
PSA.119.77	May Your compassion come to me that I may live,
PSA.119.77	For Your law is my delight.
PSA.119.78	May the arrogant be ashamed, for they subvert me with a lie;
PSA.119.79	May those who fear You turn to me,
PSA.119.79	Even those who know Your testimonies.
PSA.119.80	May my heart be blameless in Your statutes,
PSA.119.80	So that I will not be ashamed.
PSA.119.81	My soul languishes for Your salvation;
PSA.119.81	I wait for Your word.
PSA.119.82	My eyes fail 
PSA.119.82	While I say, “When will You comfort me?”
PSA.119.83	Though I have become like a wineskin in the smoke,
PSA.119.83	I do not forget Your statutes.
PSA.119.84	How many are the days of Your servant?
PSA.119.84	When will You execute judgment on those who persecute me?
PSA.119.85	The arrogant have dug pits for me,
PSA.119.86	All Your commandments are faithful;
PSA.119.86	They have persecuted me with a lie; help me!
PSA.119.87	They almost destroyed me on earth,
PSA.119.87	But as for me, I did not forsake Your precepts.
PSA.119.88	Revive me according to Your lovingkindness,
PSA.119.88	So that I may keep the testimony of Your mouth.
PSA.119.89	Forever, O L
PSA.119.89	Your word 
PSA.119.90	Your faithfulness 
PSA.119.90	You established the earth, and it stands.
PSA.119.91	They stand this day according to Your ordinances,
PSA.119.91	For all things are Your servants.
PSA.119.92	If Your law had not been my delight,
PSA.119.92	Then I would have perished in my affliction.
PSA.119.93	I will never forget Your precepts,
PSA.119.93	For by them You have revived me.
PSA.119.94	I am Yours, save me;
PSA.119.94	For I have sought Your precepts.
PSA.119.95	The wicked wait for me to destroy me;
PSA.119.95	I shall diligently consider Your testimonies.
PSA.119.96	I have seen a limit to all perfection;
PSA.119.96	Your commandment is exceedingly broad.
PSA.119.97	O how I love Your law!
PSA.119.97	It is my meditation all the day.
PSA.119.98	Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies,
PSA.119.98	For they are ever mine.
PSA.119.99	I have more insight than all my teachers,
PSA.119.99	For Your testimonies are my meditation.
PSA.119.100	I understand more than the aged,
PSA.119.100	Because I have observed Your precepts.
PSA.119.101	I have restrained my feet from every evil way,
PSA.119.101	That I may keep Your word.
PSA.119.102	I have not turned aside from Your ordinances,
PSA.119.102	For You Yourself have taught me.
PSA.119.103	How sweet are Your words to my taste!
PSA.119.104	From Your precepts I get understanding;
PSA.119.104	Therefore I hate every false way.
PSA.119.105	Your word is a lamp to my feet
PSA.119.105	And a light to my path.
PSA.119.106	I have sworn and I will confirm it,
PSA.119.106	That I will keep Your righteous ordinances.
PSA.119.107	I am exceedingly afflicted;
PSA.119.107	Revive me, O L
PSA.119.108	O accept the freewill offerings of my mouth, O L
PSA.119.108	And teach me Your ordinances.
PSA.119.109	My life is continually 
PSA.119.109	Yet I do not forget Your law.
PSA.119.110	The wicked have laid a snare for me,
PSA.119.110	Yet I have not gone astray from Your precepts.
PSA.119.111	I have inherited Your testimonies forever,
PSA.119.111	For they are the joy of my heart.
PSA.119.112	I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes
PSA.119.112	Forever, 
PSA.119.113	I hate those who are double-minded,
PSA.119.113	But I love Your law.
PSA.119.114	You are my hiding place and my shield;
PSA.119.114	I wait for Your word.
PSA.119.115	Depart from me, evildoers,
PSA.119.115	That I may observe the commandments of my God.
PSA.119.116	Sustain me according to Your word, that I may live;
PSA.119.116	And do not let me be ashamed of my hope.
PSA.119.117	Uphold me that I may be safe,
PSA.119.117	That I may have regard for Your statutes continually.
PSA.119.118	You have rejected all those who wander from Your statutes,
PSA.119.118	For their deceitfulness is useless.
PSA.119.119	You have removed all the wicked of the earth 
PSA.119.119	Therefore I love Your testimonies.
PSA.119.120	My flesh trembles for fear of You,
PSA.119.120	And I am afraid of Your judgments.
PSA.119.121	I have done justice and righteousness;
PSA.119.121	Do not leave me to my oppressors.
PSA.119.122	Be surety for Your servant for good;
PSA.119.122	Do not let the arrogant oppress me.
PSA.119.123	My eyes fail 
PSA.119.123	And for Your righteous word.
PSA.119.124	Deal with Your servant according to Your lovingkindness
PSA.119.124	And teach me Your statutes.
PSA.119.125	I am Your servant; give me understanding,
PSA.119.125	That I may know Your testimonies.
PSA.119.126	It is time for the L
PSA.119.127	Therefore I love Your commandments
PSA.119.127	Above gold, yes, above fine gold.
PSA.119.128	Therefore I esteem right all 
PSA.119.128	I hate every false way.
PSA.119.129	Your testimonies are wonderful;
PSA.119.129	Therefore my soul observes them.
PSA.119.130	The unfolding of Your words gives light;
PSA.119.130	It gives understanding to the simple.
PSA.119.131	I opened my mouth wide and panted,
PSA.119.131	For I longed for Your commandments.
PSA.119.132	Turn to me and be gracious to me,
PSA.119.132	After Your manner with those who love Your name.
PSA.119.133	Establish my footsteps in Your word,
PSA.119.133	And do not let any iniquity have dominion over me.
PSA.119.134	Redeem me from the oppression of man,
PSA.119.134	That I may keep Your precepts.
PSA.119.135	Make Your face shine upon Your servant,
PSA.119.135	And teach me Your statutes.
PSA.119.136	My eyes shed streams of water,
PSA.119.136	Because they do not keep Your law.
PSA.119.137	Righteous are You, O L
PSA.119.137	And upright are Your judgments.
PSA.119.138	You have commanded Your testimonies in righteousness
PSA.119.138	And exceeding faithfulness.
PSA.119.139	My zeal has consumed me,
PSA.119.139	Because my adversaries have forgotten Your words.
PSA.119.140	Your word is very pure,
PSA.119.140	Therefore Your servant loves it.
PSA.119.141	I am small and despised,
PSA.119.142	Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,
PSA.119.142	And Your law is truth.
PSA.119.143	Trouble and anguish have come upon me,
PSA.119.144	Your testimonies are righteous forever;
PSA.119.144	Give me understanding that I may live.
PSA.119.145	I cried with all my heart; answer me, O L
PSA.119.145	I will observe Your statutes.
PSA.119.146	I cried to You; save me
PSA.119.146	And I shall keep Your testimonies.
PSA.119.147	I rise before dawn and cry for help;
PSA.119.147	I wait for Your words.
PSA.119.148	My eyes anticipate the night watches,
PSA.119.148	That I may meditate on Your word.
PSA.119.149	Hear my voice according to Your lovingkindness;
PSA.119.149	Revive me, O L
PSA.119.150	Those who follow after wickedness draw near;
PSA.119.150	They are far from Your law.
PSA.119.151	You are near, O L
PSA.119.151	And all Your commandments are truth.
PSA.119.152	Of old I have known from Your testimonies
PSA.119.152	That You have founded them forever.
PSA.119.153	Look upon my affliction and rescue me,
PSA.119.153	For I do not forget Your law.
PSA.119.154	Plead my cause and redeem me;
PSA.119.154	Revive me according to Your word.
PSA.119.155	Salvation is far from the wicked,
PSA.119.155	For they do not seek Your statutes.
PSA.119.156	Great are Your mercies, O L
PSA.119.156	Revive me according to Your ordinances.
PSA.119.157	Many are my persecutors and my adversaries,
PSA.119.158	I behold the treacherous and loathe 
PSA.119.158	Because they do not keep Your word.
PSA.119.159	Consider how I love Your precepts;
PSA.119.159	Revive me, O L
PSA.119.160	The sum of Your word is truth,
PSA.119.160	And every one of Your righteous ordinances is everlasting.
PSA.119.161	Princes persecute me without cause,
PSA.119.161	But my heart stands in awe of Your words.
PSA.119.162	I rejoice at Your word,
PSA.119.162	As one who finds great spoil.
PSA.119.163	I hate and despise falsehood,
PSA.119.164	Seven times a day I praise You,
PSA.119.164	Because of Your righteous ordinances.
PSA.119.165	Those who love Your law have great peace,
PSA.119.165	And nothing causes them to stumble.
PSA.119.166	I hope for Your salvation, O L
PSA.119.166	And do Your commandments.
PSA.119.167	My soul keeps Your testimonies,
PSA.119.167	And I love them exceedingly.
PSA.119.168	I keep Your precepts and Your testimonies,
PSA.119.168	For all my ways are before You.
PSA.119.169	Let my cry come before You, O L
PSA.119.169	Give me understanding according to Your word.
PSA.119.170	Let my supplication come before You;
PSA.119.170	Deliver me according to Your word.
PSA.119.171	Let my lips utter praise,
PSA.119.171	For You teach me Your statutes.
PSA.119.172	Let my tongue sing of Your word,
PSA.119.172	For all Your commandments are righteousness.
PSA.119.173	Let Your hand be ready to help me,
PSA.119.173	For I have chosen Your precepts.
PSA.119.174	I long for Your salvation, O L
PSA.119.174	And Your law is my delight.
PSA.119.175	Let my soul live that it may praise You,
PSA.119.175	And let Your ordinances help me.
PSA.119.176	I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek Your servant,
PSA.119.176	For I do not forget Your commandments.
PSA.120.1	In my trouble I cried to the L
PSA.120.1	And He answered me.
PSA.120.2	Deliver my soul, O L
PSA.120.2	From a deceitful tongue.
PSA.120.3	What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you,
PSA.120.3	You deceitful tongue?
PSA.120.4	Sharp arrows of the warrior,

PSA.120.6	With those who hate peace.
PSA.120.7	I am 
PSA.120.7	They are for war.

PSA.121.8	The L
PSA.121.8	From this time forth and forever.
PSA.122.1	I was glad when they said to me,
PSA.122.1	“Let us go to the house of the L
PSA.122.2	Our feet are standing
PSA.122.2	Within your gates, O Jerusalem,

PSA.122.4	To which the tribes go up, even the tribes of the L
PSA.122.4	An ordinance for Israel—
PSA.122.4	To give thanks to the name of the L
PSA.122.5	For there thrones were set for judgment,

PSA.122.6	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:

PSA.123.3	Be gracious to us, O L
PSA.123.3	For we are greatly filled with contempt.
PSA.123.4	Our soul is greatly filled
PSA.123.4	With the scoffing of those who are at ease,

PSA.139.14	I will give thanks to You, for 
PSA.139.14	Wonderful are Your works,
PSA.139.14	And my soul knows it very well.
PSA.139.15	My frame was not hidden from You,
PSA.139.15	When I was made in secret,

PSA.139.18	If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand.
PSA.139.18	When I awake, I am still with You.
PSA.139.19	O that You would slay the wicked, O God;
PSA.139.19	Depart from me, therefore, men of bloodshed.
PSA.139.20	For they speak against You wickedly,
PSA.139.20	And Your enemies take 
PSA.139.21	Do I not hate those who hate You, O L
PSA.139.21	And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?
PSA.139.22	I hate them with the utmost hatred;
PSA.139.22	They have become my enemies.

PRO.1.1	The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:
PRO.1.2	To know wisdom and instruction,
PRO.1.2	To discern the sayings of understanding,
PRO.1.3	To receive instruction in wise behavior,
PRO.1.3	Righteousness, justice and equity;
PRO.1.4	To give prudence to the naive,
PRO.1.4	To the youth knowledge and discretion,
PRO.1.5	A wise man will hear and increase in learning,
PRO.1.5	And a man of understanding will acquire wise counsel,
PRO.1.6	To understand a proverb and a figure,
PRO.1.6	The words of the wise and their riddles.
PRO.1.7	The fear of the L
PRO.1.7	Fools despise wisdom and instruction.
PRO.1.8	Hear, my son, your father’s instruction
PRO.1.8	And do not forsake your mother’s teaching;
PRO.1.9	Indeed, they are a graceful wreath to your head
PRO.1.9	And ornaments about your neck.
PRO.1.10	My son, if sinners entice you,
PRO.1.10	Do not consent.
PRO.1.11	If they say, “Come with us,
PRO.1.11	Let us lie in wait for blood,
PRO.1.11	Let us ambush the innocent without cause;
PRO.1.12	Let us swallow them alive like Sheol,
PRO.1.12	Even whole, as those who go down to the pit;
PRO.1.13	We will find all 
PRO.1.13	We will fill our houses with spoil;
PRO.1.14	Throw in your lot with us,
PRO.1.14	We shall all have one purse,”
PRO.1.15	My son, do not walk in the way with them.
PRO.1.15	Keep your feet from their path,
PRO.1.16	For their feet run to evil
PRO.1.16	And they hasten to shed blood.
PRO.1.17	Indeed, it is useless to spread the 
PRO.1.17	In the sight of any bird;
PRO.1.18	But they lie in wait for their own blood;
PRO.1.18	They ambush their own lives.
PRO.1.19	So are the ways of everyone who gains by violence;
PRO.1.19	It takes away the life of its possessors.
PRO.1.20	Wisdom shouts in the street,
PRO.1.20	She lifts her voice in the square;
PRO.1.21	At the head of the noisy 
PRO.1.21	At the entrance of the gates in the city she utters her sayings:
PRO.1.22	“How long, O naive ones, will you love being simple-minded?
PRO.1.22	And scoffers delight themselves in scoffing
PRO.1.22	And fools hate knowledge?
PRO.1.23	Turn to my reproof,
PRO.1.23	Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you;
PRO.1.23	I will make my words known to you.
PRO.1.24	Because I called and you refused,
PRO.1.24	I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention;
PRO.1.25	And you neglected all my counsel
PRO.1.25	And did not want my reproof;
PRO.1.26	I will also laugh at your calamity;
PRO.1.26	I will mock when your dread comes,
PRO.1.27	When your dread comes like a storm
PRO.1.27	And your calamity comes like a whirlwind,
PRO.1.27	When distress and anguish come upon you.
PRO.1.28	Then they will call on me, but I will not answer;
PRO.1.28	They will seek me diligently but they will not find me,
PRO.1.29	Because they hated knowledge
PRO.1.29	And did not choose the fear of the L
PRO.1.30	They would not accept my counsel,
PRO.1.30	They spurned all my reproof.
PRO.1.31	So they shall eat of the fruit of their own way
PRO.1.31	And be satiated with their own devices.
PRO.1.32	For the waywardness of the naive will kill them,
PRO.1.32	And the complacency of fools will destroy them.
PRO.1.33	But he who listens to me shall live securely
PRO.1.33	And will be at ease from the dread of evil.”
PRO.2.1	My son, if you will receive my words
PRO.2.1	And treasure my commandments within you,
PRO.2.2	Make your ear attentive to wisdom,
PRO.2.2	Incline your heart to understanding;
PRO.2.3	For if you cry for discernment,
PRO.2.3	Lift your voice for understanding;
PRO.2.4	If you seek her as silver
PRO.2.4	And search for her as for hidden treasures;
PRO.2.5	Then you will discern the fear of the L
PRO.2.5	And discover the knowledge of God.
PRO.2.6	For the L
PRO.2.6	From His mouth 
PRO.2.7	He stores up sound wisdom for the upright;
PRO.2.8	Guarding the paths of justice,
PRO.2.8	And He preserves the way of His godly ones.
PRO.2.9	Then you will discern righteousness and justice
PRO.2.9	And equity 
PRO.2.10	For wisdom will enter your heart
PRO.2.10	And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;
PRO.2.11	Discretion will guard you,
PRO.2.11	Understanding will watch over you,
PRO.2.12	To deliver you from the way of evil,
PRO.2.12	From the man who speaks perverse things;
PRO.2.13	From those who leave the paths of uprightness
PRO.2.13	To walk in the ways of darkness;
PRO.2.14	Who delight in doing evil
PRO.2.14	And rejoice in the perversity of evil;
PRO.2.15	Whose paths are crooked,
PRO.2.15	And who are devious in their ways;
PRO.2.16	To deliver you from the strange woman,
PRO.2.16	From the adulteress who flatters with her words;
PRO.2.17	That leaves the companion of her youth
PRO.2.17	And forgets the covenant of her God;
PRO.2.18	For her house sinks down to death
PRO.2.18	And her tracks 
PRO.2.19	None who go to her return again,
PRO.2.19	Nor do they reach the paths of life.
PRO.2.20	So you will walk in the way of good men
PRO.2.20	And keep to the paths of the righteous.
PRO.2.21	For the upright will live in the land
PRO.2.21	And the blameless will remain in it;
PRO.2.22	But the wicked will be cut off from the land
PRO.2.22	And the treacherous will be uprooted from it.
PRO.3.1	My son, do not forget my teaching,
PRO.3.1	But let your heart keep my commandments;
PRO.3.2	For length of days and years of life
PRO.3.2	And peace they will add to you.
PRO.3.3	Do not let kindness and truth leave you;
PRO.3.3	Bind them around your neck,
PRO.3.3	Write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.3.4	So you will find favor and good repute
PRO.3.4	In the sight of God and man.
PRO.3.5	Trust in the L
PRO.3.5	And do not lean on your own understanding.
PRO.3.6	In all your ways acknowledge Him,
PRO.3.6	And He will make your paths straight.
PRO.3.7	Do not be wise in your own eyes;
PRO.3.7	Fear the L
PRO.3.8	It will be healing to your body
PRO.3.8	And refreshment to your bones.
PRO.3.9	Honor the L
PRO.3.9	And from the first of all your produce;
PRO.3.10	So your barns will be filled with plenty
PRO.3.10	And your vats will overflow with new wine.
PRO.3.11	My son, do not reject the discipline of the L
PRO.3.11	Or loathe His reproof,
PRO.3.12	For whom the L
PRO.3.12	Even as a father 
PRO.3.13	How blessed is the man who finds wisdom
PRO.3.13	And the man who gains understanding.
PRO.3.14	For her profit is better than the profit of silver
PRO.3.14	And her gain better than fine gold.
PRO.3.15	She is more precious than jewels;
PRO.3.15	And nothing you desire compares with her.
PRO.3.16	Long life is in her right hand;
PRO.3.16	In her left hand are riches and honor.
PRO.3.17	Her ways are pleasant ways
PRO.3.17	And all her paths are peace.
PRO.3.18	She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her,
PRO.3.18	And happy are all who hold her fast.
PRO.3.19	The L
PRO.3.19	By understanding He established the heavens.
PRO.3.20	By His knowledge the deeps were broken up
PRO.3.20	And the skies drip with dew.
PRO.3.21	My son, let them not vanish from your sight;
PRO.3.21	Keep sound wisdom and discretion,
PRO.3.22	So they will be life to your soul
PRO.3.22	And adornment to your neck.
PRO.3.23	Then you will walk in your way securely
PRO.3.23	And your foot will not stumble.
PRO.3.24	When you lie down, you will not be afraid;
PRO.3.24	When you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
PRO.3.25	Do not be afraid of sudden fear
PRO.3.25	Nor of the onslaught of the wicked when it comes;
PRO.3.26	For the L
PRO.3.26	And will keep your foot from being caught.
PRO.3.27	Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,
PRO.3.27	When it is in your power to do 
PRO.3.28	Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come back,
PRO.3.28	And tomorrow I will give 
PRO.3.28	When you have it with you.
PRO.3.29	Do not devise harm against your neighbor,
PRO.3.29	While he lives securely beside you.
PRO.3.30	Do not contend with a man without cause,
PRO.3.30	If he has done you no harm.
PRO.3.31	Do not envy a man of violence
PRO.3.31	And do not choose any of his ways.
PRO.3.32	For the devious are an abomination to the L
PRO.3.32	But He is intimate with the upright.
PRO.3.33	The curse of the L
PRO.3.33	But He blesses the dwelling of the righteous.
PRO.3.34	Though He scoffs at the scoffers,
PRO.3.34	Yet He gives grace to the afflicted.
PRO.3.35	The wise will inherit honor,
PRO.3.35	But fools display dishonor.
PRO.4.1	Hear, 
PRO.4.1	And give attention that you may gain understanding,
PRO.4.2	For I give you sound teaching;
PRO.4.2	Do not abandon my instruction.
PRO.4.3	When I was a son to my father,
PRO.4.3	Tender and the only son in the sight of my mother,
PRO.4.4	Then he taught me and said to me,
PRO.4.4	“Let your heart hold fast my words;
PRO.4.4	Keep my commandments and live;
PRO.4.5	Acquire wisdom! Acquire understanding!
PRO.4.5	Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth.
PRO.4.6	Do not forsake her, and she will guard you;
PRO.4.6	Love her, and she will watch over you.
PRO.4.7	The beginning of wisdom 
PRO.4.7	And with all your acquiring, get understanding.
PRO.4.8	Prize her, and she will exalt you;
PRO.4.8	She will honor you if you embrace her.
PRO.4.9	She will place on your head a garland of grace;
PRO.4.9	She will present you with a crown of beauty.”
PRO.4.10	Hear, my son, and accept my sayings
PRO.4.10	And the years of your life will be many.
PRO.4.11	I have directed you in the way of wisdom;
PRO.4.11	I have led you in upright paths.
PRO.4.12	When you walk, your steps will not be impeded;
PRO.4.12	And if you run, you will not stumble.
PRO.4.13	Take hold of instruction; do not let go.
PRO.4.13	Guard her, for she is your life.
PRO.4.14	Do not enter the path of the wicked
PRO.4.14	And do not proceed in the way of evil men.
PRO.4.15	Avoid it, do not pass by it;
PRO.4.15	Turn away from it and pass on.
PRO.4.16	For they cannot sleep unless they do evil;
PRO.4.16	And they are robbed of sleep unless they make 
PRO.4.17	For they eat the bread of wickedness
PRO.4.17	And drink the wine of violence.
PRO.4.18	But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn,
PRO.4.18	That shines brighter and brighter until the full day.
PRO.4.19	The way of the wicked is like darkness;
PRO.4.19	They do not know over what they stumble.
PRO.4.20	My son, give attention to my words;
PRO.4.20	Incline your ear to my sayings.
PRO.4.21	Do not let them depart from your sight;
PRO.4.21	Keep them in the midst of your heart.
PRO.4.22	For they are life to those who find them
PRO.4.22	And health to all their body.
PRO.4.23	Watch over your heart with all diligence,
PRO.4.23	For from it 
PRO.4.24	Put away from you a deceitful mouth
PRO.4.24	And put devious speech far from you.
PRO.4.25	Let your eyes look directly ahead
PRO.4.25	And let your gaze be fixed straight in front of you.
PRO.4.26	Watch the path of your feet
PRO.4.26	And all your ways will be established.
PRO.4.27	Do not turn to the right nor to the left;
PRO.4.27	Turn your foot from evil.
PRO.5.1	My son, give attention to my wisdom,
PRO.5.1	Incline your ear to my understanding;
PRO.5.2	That you may observe discretion
PRO.5.2	And your lips may reserve knowledge.
PRO.5.3	For the lips of an adulteress drip honey
PRO.5.3	And smoother than oil is her speech;
PRO.5.4	But in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
PRO.5.4	Sharp as a two-edged sword.
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death,
PRO.5.5	Her steps take hold of Sheol.
PRO.5.6	She does not ponder the path of life;
PRO.5.6	Her ways are unstable, she does not know 
PRO.5.7	Now then, 
PRO.5.7	And do not depart from the words of my mouth.
PRO.5.8	Keep your way far from her
PRO.5.8	And do not go near the door of her house,
PRO.5.9	Or you will give your vigor to others
PRO.5.9	And your years to the cruel one;
PRO.5.10	And strangers will be filled with your strength
PRO.5.10	And your hard-earned goods 
PRO.5.11	And you groan at your final end,
PRO.5.11	When your flesh and your body are consumed;
PRO.5.12	And you say, “How I have hated instruction!
PRO.5.12	And my heart spurned reproof!
PRO.5.13	I have not listened to the voice of my teachers,
PRO.5.13	Nor inclined my ear to my instructors!
PRO.5.14	I was almost in utter ruin
PRO.5.14	In the midst of the assembly and congregation.”
PRO.5.15	Drink water from your own cistern
PRO.5.15	And fresh water from your own well.
PRO.5.16	Should your springs be dispersed abroad,
PRO.5.16	Streams of water in the streets?
PRO.5.17	Let them be yours alone
PRO.5.17	And not for strangers with you.
PRO.5.18	Let your fountain be blessed,
PRO.5.18	And rejoice in the wife of your youth.
PRO.5.19	Let her breasts satisfy you at all times;
PRO.5.19	Be exhilarated always with her love.
PRO.5.20	For why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an adulteress
PRO.5.20	And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?
PRO.5.21	For the ways of a man are before the eyes of the L
PRO.5.21	And He watches all his paths.
PRO.5.22	His own iniquities will capture the wicked,
PRO.5.22	And he will be held with the cords of his sin.
PRO.5.23	He will die for lack of instruction,
PRO.5.23	And in the greatness of his folly he will go astray.
PRO.6.1	My son, if you have become surety for your neighbor,
PRO.6.1	Have given a pledge for a stranger,
PRO.6.2	Have been caught with the words of your mouth,
PRO.6.3	Do this then, my son, and deliver yourself;
PRO.6.3	Since you have come into the hand of your neighbor,
PRO.6.3	Go, humble yourself, and importune your neighbor.
PRO.6.4	Give no sleep to your eyes,
PRO.6.4	Nor slumber to your eyelids;
PRO.6.5	Deliver yourself like a gazelle from 
PRO.6.5	And like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
PRO.6.6	Go to the ant, O sluggard,
PRO.6.6	Observe her ways and be wise,
PRO.6.7	Which, having no chief,
PRO.6.7	Officer or ruler,
PRO.6.8	Prepares her food in the summer
PRO.6.9	How long will you lie down, O sluggard?
PRO.6.9	When will you arise from your sleep?
PRO.6.10	“A little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.6.10	A little folding of the hands to rest”—
PRO.6.11	Your poverty will come in like a vagabond
PRO.6.11	And your need like an armed man.
PRO.6.12	A worthless person, a wicked man,
PRO.6.12	Is the one who walks with a perverse mouth,
PRO.6.13	Who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,
PRO.6.13	Who points with his fingers;
PRO.6.14	Who 
PRO.6.14	Who spreads strife.
PRO.6.15	Therefore his calamity will come suddenly;
PRO.6.15	Instantly he will be broken and there will be no healing.
PRO.6.16	There are six things which the L
PRO.6.16	Yes, seven which are an abomination to Him:
PRO.6.17	Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
PRO.6.17	And hands that shed innocent blood,
PRO.6.18	A heart that devises wicked plans,
PRO.6.18	Feet that run rapidly to evil,
PRO.6.19	A false witness 
PRO.6.19	And one who spreads strife among brothers.
PRO.6.20	My son, observe the commandment of your father
PRO.6.20	And do not forsake the teaching of your mother;
PRO.6.21	Bind them continually on your heart;
PRO.6.21	Tie them around your neck.
PRO.6.22	When you walk about, they will guide you;
PRO.6.22	When you sleep, they will watch over you;
PRO.6.22	And when you awake, they will talk to you.
PRO.6.23	For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light;
PRO.6.23	And reproofs for discipline are the way of life
PRO.6.24	To keep you from the evil woman,
PRO.6.24	From the smooth tongue of the adulteress.
PRO.6.25	Do not desire her beauty in your heart,
PRO.6.25	Nor let her capture you with her eyelids.
PRO.6.26	For on account of a harlot 
PRO.6.26	And an adulteress hunts for the precious life.
PRO.6.27	Can a man take fire in his bosom
PRO.6.27	And his clothes not be burned?
PRO.6.28	Or can a man walk on hot coals
PRO.6.28	And his feet not be scorched?
PRO.6.29	So is the one who goes in to his neighbor’s wife;
PRO.6.29	Whoever touches her will not go unpunished.
PRO.6.30	Men do not despise a thief if he steals
PRO.6.30	To satisfy himself when he is hungry;
PRO.6.31	But when he is found, he must repay sevenfold;
PRO.6.31	He must give all the substance of his house.
PRO.6.32	The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense;
PRO.6.32	He who would destroy himself does it.
PRO.6.33	Wounds and disgrace he will find,
PRO.6.33	And his reproach will not be blotted out.
PRO.6.34	For jealousy enrages a man,
PRO.6.34	And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
PRO.6.35	He will not accept any ransom,
PRO.6.35	Nor will he be satisfied though you give many gifts.
PRO.7.1	My son, keep my words
PRO.7.1	And treasure my commandments within you.
PRO.7.2	Keep my commandments and live,
PRO.7.2	And my teaching as the apple of your eye.
PRO.7.3	Bind them on your fingers;
PRO.7.3	Write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.7.4	Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
PRO.7.4	And call understanding 
PRO.7.5	That they may keep you from an adulteress,
PRO.7.5	From the foreigner who flatters with her words.
PRO.7.6	For at the window of my house
PRO.7.6	I looked out through my lattice,
PRO.7.7	And I saw among the naive,
PRO.7.7	A young man lacking sense,
PRO.7.8	Passing through the street near her corner;
PRO.7.8	And he takes the way to her house,
PRO.7.9	In the twilight, in the evening,
PRO.7.9	In the middle of the night and 
PRO.7.10	And behold, a woman 
PRO.7.10	Dressed as a harlot and cunning of heart.
PRO.7.11	She is boisterous and rebellious,
PRO.7.11	Her feet do not remain at home;
PRO.7.12	And lurks by every corner.
PRO.7.13	So she seizes him and kisses him
PRO.7.13	And with a brazen face she says to him:
PRO.7.14	“I was due to offer peace offerings;
PRO.7.14	Today I have paid my vows.
PRO.7.15	Therefore I have come out to meet you,
PRO.7.15	To seek your presence earnestly, and I have found you.
PRO.7.16	I have spread my couch with coverings,
PRO.7.16	With colored linens of Egypt.
PRO.7.17	I have sprinkled my bed
PRO.7.17	With myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let us drink our fill of love until morning;
PRO.7.18	Let us delight ourselves with caresses.
PRO.7.19	For my husband is not at home,
PRO.7.19	He has gone on a long journey;
PRO.7.20	He has taken a bag of money with him,
PRO.7.20	At the full moon he will come home.”
PRO.7.21	With her many persuasions she entices him;
PRO.7.21	With her flattering lips she seduces him.
PRO.7.22	Suddenly he follows her
PRO.7.22	As an ox goes to the slaughter,
PRO.7.22	Or as 
PRO.7.23	Until an arrow pierces through his liver;
PRO.7.23	As a bird hastens to the snare,
PRO.7.23	So he does not know that it 
PRO.7.24	Now therefore, 
PRO.7.24	And pay attention to the words of my mouth.
PRO.7.25	Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways,
PRO.7.25	Do not stray into her paths.
PRO.7.26	For many are the victims she has cast down,
PRO.7.26	And numerous are all her slain.
PRO.7.27	Her house is the way to Sheol,
PRO.7.27	Descending to the chambers of death.
PRO.8.1	Does not wisdom call,
PRO.8.1	And understanding lift up her voice?
PRO.8.2	On top of the heights beside the way,
PRO.8.2	Where the paths meet, she takes her stand;
PRO.8.3	Beside the gates, at the opening to the city,
PRO.8.3	At the entrance of the doors, she cries out:
PRO.8.4	“To you, O men, I call,
PRO.8.4	And my voice is to the sons of men.
PRO.8.5	O naive ones, understand prudence;
PRO.8.5	And, O fools, understand wisdom.
PRO.8.6	Listen, for I will speak noble things;
PRO.8.6	And the opening of my lips 
PRO.8.7	For my mouth will utter truth;
PRO.8.7	And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
PRO.8.8	All the utterances of my mouth are in righteousness;
PRO.8.8	There is nothing crooked or perverted in them.
PRO.8.9	They are all straightforward to him who understands,
PRO.8.9	And right to those who find knowledge.
PRO.8.10	Take my instruction and not silver,
PRO.8.10	And knowledge rather than choicest gold.
PRO.8.11	For wisdom is better than jewels;
PRO.8.11	And all desirable things cannot compare with her.
PRO.8.12	“I, wisdom, dwell with prudence,

PRO.8.24	When there were no springs abounding with water.
PRO.8.25	Before the mountains were settled,
PRO.8.25	Before the hills I was brought forth;
PRO.8.26	While He had not yet made the earth and the fields,
PRO.8.26	Nor the first dust of the world.
PRO.8.27	When He established the heavens, I was there,
PRO.8.27	When He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep,
PRO.8.28	When He made firm the skies above,
PRO.8.28	When the springs of the deep became fixed,
PRO.8.29	When He set for the sea its boundary
PRO.8.29	So that the water would not transgress His command,
PRO.8.29	When He marked out the foundations of the earth;
PRO.8.30	Then I was beside Him,

PRO.10.7	The memory of the righteous is blessed,

PRO.10.12	Hatred stirs up strife,
PRO.10.12	But love covers all transgressions.
PRO.10.13	On the lips of the discerning, wisdom is found,
PRO.10.13	But a rod is for the back of him who lacks understanding.
PRO.10.14	Wise men store up knowledge,

PRO.11.30	And he who is wise wins souls.
PRO.11.31	If the righteous will be rewarded in the earth,
PRO.11.31	How much more the wicked and the sinner!
PRO.12.1	Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,

PRO.12.8	But one of perverse mind will be despised.
PRO.12.9	Better is he who is lightly esteemed and has a servant
PRO.12.9	Than he who honors himself and lacks bread.
PRO.12.10	A righteous man has regard for the life of his animal,
PRO.12.10	But 
PRO.12.11	He who tills his land will have plenty of bread,
PRO.12.11	But he who pursues worthless

PRO.12.14	A man will be satisfied with good by the fruit of his words,
PRO.12.14	And the deeds of a man’s hands will return to him.
PRO.12.15	The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,
PRO.12.15	But a wise man is he who listens to counsel.
PRO.12.16	A fool’s anger is known at once,
PRO.12.16	But a prudent man conceals dishonor.
PRO.12.17	He who speaks truth tells what is right,
PRO.12.17	But a false witness, deceit.
PRO.12.18	There is one who speaks rashly like the thrusts of a sword,
PRO.12.18	But the tongue of the wise brings healing.
PRO.12.19	Truthful lips will be established forever,
PRO.12.19	But a lying tongue is only for a moment.

PRO.12.22	Lying lips are an abomination to the L

PRO.12.23	A prudent man conceals knowledge,

PRO.13.1	A wise son 
PRO.13.1	But a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.
PRO.13.2	From the fruit of a man’s mouth he enjoys good,
PRO.13.2	But the desire of the treacherous is violence.
PRO.13.3	The one who guards his mouth preserves his life;
PRO.13.3	The one who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.
PRO.13.4	The soul of the sluggard craves and 
PRO.13.4	But the soul of the diligent is made fat.
PRO.13.5	A righteous man hates falsehood,
PRO.13.5	But a wicked man acts disgustingly and shamefully.
PRO.13.6	Righteousness guards the one whose way is blameless,

PRO.13.12	Hope deferred makes the heart sick,

PRO.13.13	But the one who fears the commandment will be rewarded.
PRO.13.14	The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life,
PRO.13.14	To turn aside from the snares of death.
PRO.13.15	Good understanding produces favor,
PRO.13.15	But the way of the treacherous is hard.
PRO.13.16	Every prudent man acts with knowledge,
PRO.13.16	But a fool displays folly.

PRO.13.19	Desire realized is sweet to the soul,
PRO.13.19	But it is an abomination to fools to turn away from evil.
PRO.13.20	He who walks with wise men will be wise,
PRO.13.20	But the companion of fools will suffer harm.
PRO.13.21	Adversity pursues sinners,
PRO.13.21	But the righteous will be rewarded with prosperity.
PRO.13.22	A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,
PRO.13.22	And the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous.
PRO.13.23	Abundant food 
PRO.13.23	But it is swept away by injustice.
PRO.13.24	He who withholds his rod hates his son,
PRO.13.24	But he who loves him disciplines him diligently.
PRO.13.25	The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite,
PRO.13.25	But the stomach of the wicked is in need.
PRO.14.1	The wise woman builds her house,
PRO.14.1	But the foolish tears it down with her own hands.

PRO.14.6	A scoffer seeks wisdom and 
PRO.14.6	But knowledge is easy to one who has understanding.
PRO.14.7	Leave the presence of a fool,
PRO.14.7	Or you will not discern words of knowledge.
PRO.14.8	The wisdom of the sensible is to understand his way,
PRO.14.8	But the foolishness of fools is deceit.
PRO.14.9	Fools mock at sin,
PRO.14.9	But among the upright there is good will.
PRO.14.10	The heart knows its own bitterness,
PRO.14.10	And a stranger does not share its joy.
PRO.14.11	The house of the wicked will be destroyed,
PRO.14.11	But the tent of the upright will flourish.
PRO.14.12	There is a way 
PRO.14.12	But its end is the way of death.
PRO.14.13	Even in laughter the heart may be in pain,
PRO.14.13	And the end of joy may be grief.
PRO.14.14	The backslider in heart will have his fill of his own ways,
PRO.14.14	But a good man will 
PRO.14.15	The naive believes everything,
PRO.14.15	But the sensible man considers his steps.
PRO.14.16	A wise man is cautious and turns away from evil,
PRO.14.16	But a fool is arrogant and careless.
PRO.14.17	A quick-tempered man acts foolishly,
PRO.14.17	And a man of evil devices is hated.
PRO.14.18	The naive inherit foolishness,
PRO.14.18	But the sensible are crowned with knowledge.
PRO.14.19	The evil will bow down before the good,
PRO.14.19	And the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
PRO.14.20	The poor is hated even by his neighbor,
PRO.14.20	But those who love the rich are many.
PRO.14.21	He who despises his neighbor sins,
PRO.14.21	But happy is he who is gracious to the poor.
PRO.14.22	Will they not go astray who devise evil?
PRO.14.22	But kindness and truth 
PRO.14.23	In all labor there is profit,
PRO.14.23	But mere talk

PRO.14.29	He who is slow to anger has great understanding,
PRO.14.29	But he who is quick-tempered exalts folly.
PRO.14.30	A tranquil heart is life to the body,
PRO.14.30	But passion is rottenness to the bones.
PRO.14.31	He who oppresses the poor taunts his Maker,
PRO.14.31	But he who is gracious to the needy honors Him.
PRO.14.32	The wicked is thrust down by his wrongdoing,
PRO.14.32	But the righteous has a refuge when he dies.
PRO.14.33	Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding,
PRO.14.33	But in the hearts of fools it is made known.
PRO.14.34	Righteousness exalts a nation,
PRO.14.34	But sin is a disgrace to 
PRO.14.35	The king’s favor is toward a servant who acts wisely,
PRO.14.35	But his anger is toward him who acts shamefully.
PRO.15.1	A gentle answer turns away wrath,

PRO.15.4	A soothing tongue is a tree of life,
PRO.15.4	But perversion in it crushes the spirit.
PRO.15.5	A fool rejects his father’s discipline,
PRO.15.5	But he who regards reproof is sensible.
PRO.15.6	Great wealth is 
PRO.15.6	But trouble is in the income of the wicked.
PRO.15.7	The lips of the wise spread knowledge,
PRO.15.7	But the hearts of fools are not so.
PRO.15.8	The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the L
PRO.15.8	But the prayer of the upright is His delight.
PRO.15.9	The way of the wicked is an abomination to the L
PRO.15.9	But He loves one who pursues righteousness.
PRO.15.10	Grievous punishment is for him who forsakes the way;
PRO.15.10	He who hates reproof will die.
PRO.15.11	Sheol and Abaddon 
PRO.15.11	How much more the hearts of men!
PRO.15.12	A scoffer does not love one who reproves him,
PRO.15.12	He will not go to the wise.
PRO.15.13	A joyful heart makes a cheerful face,
PRO.15.13	But when the heart is sad, the spirit is broken.
PRO.15.14	The mind of the intelligent seeks knowledge,
PRO.15.14	But the mouth of fools feeds on folly.
PRO.15.15	All the days of the afflicted are bad,
PRO.15.15	But a cheerful heart 
PRO.15.16	Better is a little with the fear of the L
PRO.15.16	Than great treasure and turmoil with it.
PRO.15.17	Better is a dish of vegetables where love is
PRO.15.17	Than a fattened ox 
PRO.15.18	A hot-tempered man stirs up strife,
PRO.15.18	But the slow to anger calms a dispute.
PRO.15.19	The way of the lazy is as a hedge of thorns,

PRO.23.22	And do not despise your mother when she is old.
PRO.23.23	Buy truth, and do not sell 
PRO.23.24	The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice,
PRO.23.24	And he who sires a wise son will be glad in him.
PRO.23.25	Let your father and your mother be glad,
PRO.23.25	And let her rejoice who gave birth to you.
PRO.23.26	Give me your heart, my son,
PRO.23.26	And let your eyes delight in my ways.
PRO.23.27	For a harlot is a deep pit
PRO.23.27	And an adulterous woman is a narrow well.
PRO.23.28	Surely she lurks as a robber,
PRO.23.28	And increases the faithless among men.
PRO.23.29	Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
PRO.23.29	Who has contentions? Who has complaining?
PRO.23.29	Who has wounds without cause?
PRO.23.29	Who has redness of eyes?
PRO.23.30	Those who linger long over wine,
PRO.23.30	Those who go to taste mixed wine.
PRO.23.31	Do not look on the wine when it is red,
PRO.23.31	When it sparkles in the cup,
PRO.23.31	When it goes down smoothly;
PRO.23.32	At the last it bites like a serpent
PRO.23.32	And stings like a viper.
PRO.23.33	Your eyes will see strange things
PRO.23.33	And your mind will utter perverse things.
PRO.23.34	And you will be like one who lies down in the middle of the sea,
PRO.23.34	Or like one who lies down on the top of a 
PRO.23.35	“They struck me, 
PRO.23.35	They beat me, 
PRO.23.35	When shall I awake?
PRO.23.35	I will seek another drink.”
PRO.24.1	Do not be envious of evil men,
PRO.24.1	Nor desire to be with them;
PRO.24.2	For their minds devise violence,
PRO.24.2	And their lips talk of trouble.
PRO.24.3	By wisdom a house is built,
PRO.24.3	And by understanding it is established;
PRO.24.4	And by knowledge the rooms are filled
PRO.24.4	With all precious and pleasant riches.
PRO.24.5	A wise man is strong,
PRO.24.5	And a man of knowledge increases power.
PRO.24.6	For by wise guidance you will wage war,
PRO.24.6	And in abundance of counselors there is victory.
PRO.24.7	Wisdom is 
PRO.24.7	He does not open his mouth in the gate.
PRO.24.8	One who plans to do evil,
PRO.24.8	Men will call a schemer.
PRO.24.9	The devising of folly is sin,
PRO.24.9	And the scoffer is an abomination to men.
PRO.24.10	If you are slack in the day of distress,
PRO.24.10	Your strength is limited.
PRO.24.11	Deliver those who are being taken away to death,
PRO.24.11	And those who are staggering to slaughter, Oh hold 
PRO.24.12	If you say, “See, we did not know this,”
PRO.24.12	Does He not consider 
PRO.24.12	And does He not know 
PRO.24.12	And will He not render to man according to his work?
PRO.24.13	My son, eat honey, for it is good,
PRO.24.13	Yes, the honey from the comb is sweet to your taste;
PRO.24.14	Know 
PRO.24.14	If you find 
PRO.24.14	And your hope will not be cut off.
PRO.24.15	Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous;
PRO.24.15	Do not destroy his resting place;
PRO.24.16	For a righteous man falls seven times, and rises again,
PRO.24.16	But the wicked stumble in 
PRO.24.17	Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,
PRO.24.17	And do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles;
PRO.24.18	Or the L
PRO.24.18	And turn His anger away from him.
PRO.24.19	Do not fret because of evildoers
PRO.24.19	Or be envious of the wicked;
PRO.24.20	For there will be no future for the evil man;
PRO.24.20	The lamp of the wicked will be put out.
PRO.24.21	My son, fear the L
PRO.24.21	Do not associate with those who are given to change,
PRO.24.22	For their calamity will rise suddenly,
PRO.24.22	And who knows the ruin 
PRO.24.23	These also are sayings of the wise.
PRO.24.23	To show partiality in judgment is not good.
PRO.24.24	He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,”
PRO.24.24	Peoples will curse him, nations will abhor him;
PRO.24.25	But to those who rebuke the 
PRO.24.25	And a good blessing will come upon them.
PRO.24.26	He kisses the lips
PRO.24.26	Who gives a right answer.
PRO.24.27	Prepare your work outside
PRO.24.27	And make it ready for yourself in the field;
PRO.24.27	Afterwards, then, build your house.
PRO.24.28	Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause,
PRO.24.28	And do not deceive with your lips.
PRO.24.29	Do not say, “Thus I shall do to him as he has done to me;
PRO.24.29	I will render to the man according to his work.”
PRO.24.30	I passed by the field of the sluggard
PRO.24.30	And by the vineyard of the man lacking sense,
PRO.24.31	And behold, it was completely overgrown with thistles;
PRO.24.31	Its surface was covered with nettles,
PRO.24.31	And its stone wall was broken down.
PRO.24.32	When I saw, I reflected upon it;
PRO.24.32	I looked, 
PRO.24.33	“A little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.24.33	A little folding of the hands to rest,”
PRO.24.34	Then your poverty will come 
PRO.24.34	And your want like an armed man.
PRO.25.1	These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah, transcribed.
PRO.25.2	It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,
PRO.25.2	But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.
PRO.25.3	So the heart of kings is unsearchable.
PRO.25.4	Take away the dross from the silver,
PRO.25.4	And there comes out a vessel for the smith;
PRO.25.5	Take away the wicked before the king,
PRO.25.5	And his throne will be established in righteousness.
PRO.25.6	Do not claim honor in the presence of the king,
PRO.25.6	And do not stand in the place of great men;
PRO.25.7	For it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,”
PRO.25.7	Than for you to be placed lower in the presence of the prince,
PRO.25.7	Whom your eyes have seen.
PRO.25.8	Do not go out hastily to argue 
PRO.25.8	Otherwise, what will you do in the end,
PRO.25.8	When your neighbor humiliates you?
PRO.25.9	Argue your case with your neighbor,
PRO.25.9	And do not reveal the secret of another,
PRO.25.10	Or he who hears 
PRO.25.10	And the evil report about you will not pass away.
PRO.25.11	Is a word spoken in right circumstances.
PRO.25.12	Is a wise reprover to a listening ear.
PRO.25.13	Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest
PRO.25.13	Is a faithful messenger to those who send him,
PRO.25.13	For he refreshes the soul of his masters.
PRO.25.14	Is a man who boasts of his gifts falsely.
PRO.25.15	By forbearance a ruler may be persuaded,
PRO.25.15	And a soft tongue breaks the bone.
PRO.25.16	Have you found honey? Eat 
PRO.25.16	That you not have it in excess and vomit it.
PRO.25.17	Let your foot rarely be in your neighbor’s house,
PRO.25.17	Or he will become weary of you and hate you.
PRO.25.18	Is a man who bears false witness against his neighbor.
PRO.25.19	Is confidence in a faithless man in time of trouble.
PRO.25.20	Is he who sings songs to a troubled heart.
PRO.25.21	If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat;
PRO.25.21	And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;
PRO.25.22	For you will heap burning coals on his head,
PRO.25.22	And the L
PRO.25.23	The north wind brings forth rain,
PRO.25.23	And a backbiting tongue, an angry countenance.
PRO.25.24	It is better to live in a corner of the roof
PRO.25.24	Than in a house shared with a contentious woman.
PRO.25.25	So is good news from a distant land.
PRO.25.26	Is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.
PRO.25.27	It is not good to eat much honey,
PRO.25.27	Nor is it glory to search out one’s own glory.
PRO.25.28	Is a man who has no control over his spirit.
PRO.26.1	Like snow in summer and like rain in harvest,
PRO.26.1	So honor is not fitting for a fool.
PRO.26.2	Like a sparrow in 
PRO.26.2	So a curse without cause does not alight.
PRO.26.3	A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey,
PRO.26.3	And a rod for the back of fools.
PRO.26.4	Do not answer a fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.4	Or you will also be like him.
PRO.26.5	Answer a fool as his folly 
PRO.26.5	That he not be wise in his own eyes.
PRO.26.6	He cuts off 
PRO.26.6	Who sends a message by the hand of a fool.
PRO.26.7	So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
PRO.26.8	Like one who binds a stone in a sling,
PRO.26.8	So is he who gives honor to a fool.
PRO.26.9	So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
PRO.26.10	So is he who hires a fool or who hires those who pass by.
PRO.26.11	Like a dog that returns to its vomit
PRO.26.11	Is a fool who repeats his folly.
PRO.26.12	Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?
PRO.26.12	There is more hope for a fool than for him.
PRO.26.13	The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!
PRO.26.13	A lion is in the open square!”
PRO.26.14	So 
PRO.26.15	The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
PRO.26.15	He is weary of bringing it to his mouth again.
PRO.26.16	The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes
PRO.26.16	Than seven men who can give a discreet answer.
PRO.26.17	Is he who passes by 
PRO.26.18	Like a madman who throws
PRO.26.18	Firebrands, arrows and death,
PRO.26.19	So is the man who deceives his neighbor,
PRO.26.19	And says, “Was I not joking?”
PRO.26.20	For lack of wood the fire goes out,
PRO.26.20	And where there is no whisperer, contention quiets down.
PRO.26.21	So is a contentious man to kindle strife.
PRO.26.22	The words of a whisperer are like dainty morsels,
PRO.26.22	And they go down into the innermost parts of the body.
PRO.26.23	Are burning lips and a wicked heart.
PRO.26.24	He who hates disguises 
PRO.26.24	But he lays up deceit in his heart.
PRO.26.25	When he speaks graciously, do not believe him,
PRO.26.25	For there are seven abominations in his heart.
PRO.26.26	His wickedness will be revealed before the assembly.
PRO.26.27	He who digs a pit will fall into it,
PRO.26.27	And he who rolls a stone, it will come back on him.
PRO.26.28	A lying tongue hates those it crushes,
PRO.26.28	And a flattering mouth works ruin.
PRO.27.1	Do not boast about tomorrow,
PRO.27.1	For you do not know what a day may bring forth.
PRO.27.2	Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;
PRO.27.2	A stranger, and not your own lips.
PRO.27.3	A stone is heavy and the sand weighty,
PRO.27.3	But the provocation of a fool is heavier than both of them.
PRO.27.4	Wrath is fierce and anger is a flood,
PRO.27.4	But who can stand before jealousy?
PRO.27.5	Better is open rebuke
PRO.27.5	Than love that is concealed.
PRO.27.6	Faithful are the wounds of a friend,
PRO.27.6	But deceitful are the kisses of an enemy.
PRO.27.7	A sated man loathes honey,
PRO.27.7	But to a famished man any bitter thing is sweet.
PRO.27.8	Like a bird that wanders from her nest,
PRO.27.8	So is a man who wanders from his home.
PRO.27.9	Oil and perfume make the heart glad,
PRO.27.9	So a man’s counsel is sweet to his friend.
PRO.27.10	Do not forsake your own friend or your father’s friend,
PRO.27.10	And do not go to your brother’s house in the day of your calamity;
PRO.27.10	Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother far away.
PRO.27.11	Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad,
PRO.27.11	That I may reply to him who reproaches me.
PRO.27.12	A prudent man sees evil 
PRO.27.12	The naive proceed 
PRO.27.13	Take his garment when he becomes surety for a stranger;
PRO.27.13	And for an adulterous woman hold him in pledge.
PRO.27.14	He who blesses his friend with a loud voice early in the morning,
PRO.27.14	It will be reckoned a curse to him.
PRO.27.15	A constant dripping on a day of steady rain
PRO.27.15	And a contentious woman are alike;
PRO.27.16	He who would restrain her restrains the wind,
PRO.27.16	And grasps oil with his right hand.
PRO.27.17	Iron sharpens iron,
PRO.27.17	So one man sharpens another.
PRO.27.18	He who tends the fig tree will eat its fruit,
PRO.27.18	And he who cares for his master will be honored.
PRO.27.19	As in water face 
PRO.27.19	So the heart of man 
PRO.27.20	Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied,
PRO.27.20	Nor are the eyes of man ever satisfied.
PRO.27.21	The crucible is for silver and the furnace for gold,
PRO.27.21	And each 
PRO.27.22	Though you pound a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain,
PRO.27.23	Know well the condition of your flocks,
PRO.27.24	For riches are not forever,
PRO.27.24	Nor does a crown 
PRO.27.25	And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in,
PRO.27.26	The lambs 
PRO.27.26	And the goats 
PRO.27.27	And 
PRO.27.27	For the food of your household,
PRO.27.27	And sustenance for your maidens.
PRO.28.1	The wicked flee when no one is pursuing,
PRO.28.1	But the righteous are bold as a lion.
PRO.28.2	By the transgression of a land many are its princes,
PRO.28.2	But by a man of understanding 
PRO.28.3	A poor man who oppresses the lowly
PRO.28.3	Is 
PRO.28.4	Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,
PRO.28.4	But those who keep the law strive with them.
PRO.28.5	Evil men do not understand justice,
PRO.28.5	But those who seek the L
PRO.28.6	Better is the poor who walks in his integrity
PRO.28.6	Than he who is crooked though he be rich.
PRO.28.7	He who keeps the law is a discerning son,
PRO.28.7	But he who is a companion of gluttons humiliates his father.
PRO.28.8	He who increases his wealth by interest and usury
PRO.28.8	Gathers it for him who is gracious to the poor.
PRO.28.9	He who turns away his ear from listening to the law,
PRO.28.9	Even his prayer is an abomination.
PRO.28.10	He who leads the upright astray in an evil way
PRO.28.10	Will himself fall into his own pit,
PRO.28.10	But the blameless will inherit good.
PRO.28.11	The rich man is wise in his own eyes,
PRO.28.11	But the poor who has understanding sees through him.
PRO.28.12	When the righteous triumph, there is great glory,
PRO.28.12	But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
PRO.28.13	He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
PRO.28.13	But he who confesses and forsakes 
PRO.28.14	How blessed is the man who fears always,
PRO.28.14	But he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity.
PRO.28.15	Is a wicked ruler over a poor people.
PRO.28.16	A leader who is a great oppressor lacks understanding,
PRO.28.17	A man who is laden with the guilt of human blood
PRO.28.17	Will be a fugitive until death; let no one support him.
PRO.28.18	He who walks blamelessly will be delivered,
PRO.28.18	But he who is crooked will fall all at once.
PRO.28.19	He who tills his land will have plenty of food,
PRO.28.19	But he who follows empty 
PRO.28.20	A faithful man will abound with blessings,
PRO.28.20	But he who makes haste to be rich will not go unpunished.
PRO.28.21	To show partiality is not good,
PRO.28.21	Because for a piece of bread a man will transgress.
PRO.28.22	A man with an evil eye hastens after wealth
PRO.28.22	And does not know that want will come upon him.
PRO.28.23	He who rebukes a man will afterward find 
PRO.28.23	Than he who flatters with the tongue.
PRO.28.24	He who robs his father or his mother
PRO.28.24	And says, “It is not a transgression,”
PRO.28.24	Is the companion of a man who destroys.
PRO.28.25	An arrogant man stirs up strife,
PRO.28.25	But he who trusts in the L
PRO.28.26	He who trusts in his own heart is a fool,
PRO.28.26	But he who walks wisely will be delivered.
PRO.28.27	He who gives to the poor will never want,
PRO.28.27	But he who shuts his eyes will have many curses.
PRO.28.28	When the wicked rise, men hide themselves;
PRO.28.28	But when they perish, the righteous increase.
PRO.29.1	A man who hardens 
PRO.29.1	Will suddenly be broken beyond remedy.
PRO.29.2	When the righteous increase, the people rejoice,
PRO.29.2	But when a wicked man rules, people groan.
PRO.29.3	A man who loves wisdom makes his father glad,
PRO.29.3	But he who keeps company with harlots wastes 
PRO.29.4	The king gives stability to the land by justice,
PRO.29.4	But a man who takes bribes overthrows it.
PRO.29.5	A man who flatters his neighbor
PRO.29.5	Is spreading a net for his steps.
PRO.29.6	By transgression an evil man is ensnared,
PRO.29.6	But the righteous sings and rejoices.
PRO.29.7	The righteous is concerned for the rights of the poor,
PRO.29.7	The wicked does not understand 
PRO.29.8	Scorners set a city aflame,
PRO.29.8	But wise men turn away anger.
PRO.29.9	When a wise man has a controversy with a foolish man,
PRO.29.9	The foolish man either rages or laughs, and there is no rest.
PRO.29.10	Men of bloodshed hate the blameless,
PRO.29.10	But the upright are concerned for his life.
PRO.29.11	A fool always loses his temper,
PRO.29.11	But a wise man holds it back.
PRO.29.12	If a ruler pays attention to falsehood,
PRO.29.12	All his ministers 
PRO.29.13	The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:
PRO.29.13	The L
PRO.29.14	If a king judges the poor with truth,
PRO.29.14	His throne will be established forever.
PRO.29.15	The rod and reproof give wisdom,
PRO.29.15	But a child who gets his own way brings shame to his mother.
PRO.29.16	When the wicked increase, transgression increases;
PRO.29.16	But the righteous will see their fall.
PRO.29.17	Correct your son, and he will give you comfort;
PRO.29.17	He will also delight your soul.
PRO.29.18	Where there is no vision, the people are unrestrained,
PRO.29.18	But happy is he who keeps the law.
PRO.29.19	A slave will not be instructed by words 
PRO.29.19	For though he understands, there will be no response.
PRO.29.20	Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?
PRO.29.20	There is more hope for a fool than for him.
PRO.29.21	He who pampers his slave from childhood
PRO.29.21	Will in the end find him to be a son.
PRO.29.22	An angry man stirs up strife,
PRO.29.22	And a hot-tempered man abounds in transgression.
PRO.29.23	A man’s pride will bring him low,
PRO.29.23	But a humble spirit will obtain honor.
PRO.29.24	He who is a partner with a thief hates his own life;
PRO.29.24	He hears the oath but tells nothing.
PRO.29.25	The fear of man brings a snare,
PRO.29.25	But he who trusts in the L
PRO.29.26	Many seek the ruler’s favor,
PRO.29.26	But justice for man 
PRO.29.27	An unjust man is abominable to the righteous,
PRO.29.27	And he who is upright in the way is abominable to the wicked.
PRO.30.1	The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the oracle.
PRO.30.2	Surely I am more stupid than any man,
PRO.30.2	And I do not have the understanding of a man.
PRO.30.3	Neither have I learned wisdom,
PRO.30.3	Nor do I have the knowledge of the Holy One.
PRO.30.4	Who has ascended into heaven and descended?
PRO.30.4	Who has gathered the wind in His fists?
PRO.30.4	Who has wrapped the waters in His garment?
PRO.30.4	Who has established all the ends of the earth?
PRO.30.4	What is His name or His son’s name?
PRO.30.4	Surely you know!
PRO.30.5	Every word of God is tested;
PRO.30.5	He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.
PRO.30.6	Do not add to His words
PRO.30.6	Or He will reprove you, and you will be proved a liar.
PRO.30.7	Two things I asked of You,
PRO.30.7	Do not refuse me before I die:
PRO.30.8	Keep deception and lies far from me,
PRO.30.8	Give me neither poverty nor riches;
PRO.30.8	Feed me with the food that is my portion,
PRO.30.9	That I not be full and deny 
PRO.30.9	Or that I not be in want and steal,
PRO.30.9	And profane the name of my God.
PRO.30.10	Do not slander a slave to his master,
PRO.30.10	Or he will curse you and you will be found guilty.
PRO.30.11	There is a 
PRO.30.11	And does not bless his mother.
PRO.30.12	There is a kind who is pure in his own eyes,
PRO.30.12	Yet is not washed from his filthiness.
PRO.30.13	There is a kind—oh how lofty are his eyes!
PRO.30.13	And his eyelids are raised 
PRO.30.14	There is a kind of 
PRO.30.14	And his jaw teeth 
PRO.30.14	To devour the afflicted from the earth
PRO.30.14	And the needy from among men.
PRO.30.15	The leech has two daughters,
PRO.30.15	“Give,” “Give.”
PRO.30.15	There are three things that will not be satisfied,
PRO.30.15	Four that will not say, “Enough”:
PRO.30.16	Sheol, and the barren womb,
PRO.30.16	Earth that is never satisfied with water,
PRO.30.16	And fire that never says, “Enough.”
PRO.30.17	The eye that mocks a father
PRO.30.17	And scorns a mother,
PRO.30.17	The ravens of the valley will pick it out,
PRO.30.17	And the young eagles will eat it.
PRO.30.18	There are three things which are too wonderful for me,
PRO.30.18	Four which I do not understand:
PRO.30.19	The way of an eagle in the sky,
PRO.30.19	The way of a serpent on a rock,
PRO.30.19	The way of a ship in the middle of the sea,
PRO.30.19	And the way of a man with a maid.
PRO.30.20	This is the way of an adulterous woman:
PRO.30.20	She eats and wipes her mouth,
PRO.30.20	And says, “I have done no wrong.”
PRO.30.21	Under three things the earth quakes,
PRO.30.21	And under four, it cannot bear up:
PRO.30.22	Under a slave when he becomes king,
PRO.30.22	And a fool when he is satisfied with food,
PRO.30.23	Under an unloved woman when she gets a husband,
PRO.30.23	And a maidservant when she supplants her mistress.
PRO.30.24	Four things are small on the earth,
PRO.30.24	But they are exceedingly wise:
PRO.30.25	The ants are not a strong people,
PRO.30.25	But they prepare their food in the summer;
PRO.30.26	The shephanim are not mighty people,
PRO.30.26	Yet they make their houses in the rocks;
PRO.30.27	The locusts have no king,
PRO.30.27	Yet all of them go out in ranks;
PRO.30.28	The lizard you may grasp with the hands,
PRO.30.28	Yet it is in kings’ palaces.
PRO.30.29	There are three things which are stately in 
PRO.30.29	Even four which are stately when they walk:
PRO.30.30	The lion 
PRO.30.30	And does not retreat before any,
PRO.30.31	The strutting rooster, the male goat also,
PRO.30.31	And a king 
PRO.30.32	If you have been foolish in exalting yourself
PRO.30.32	Or if you have plotted 
PRO.30.33	For the churning of milk produces butter,

PRO.31.1	The words of King Lemuel, the oracle which his mother taught him:
PRO.31.2	What, O my son?
PRO.31.2	And what, O son of my womb?
PRO.31.2	And what, O son of my vows?
PRO.31.3	Do not give your strength to women,
PRO.31.3	Or your ways to that which destroys kings.
PRO.31.4	It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
PRO.31.4	It is not for kings to drink wine,
PRO.31.4	Or for rulers to desire strong drink,
PRO.31.5	For they will drink and forget what is decreed,
PRO.31.5	And pervert the rights of all the afflicted.
PRO.31.6	Give strong drink to him who is perishing,
PRO.31.6	And wine to him whose life is bitter.
PRO.31.7	Let him drink and forget his poverty
PRO.31.7	And remember his trouble no more.
PRO.31.8	Open your mouth for the mute,
PRO.31.8	For the rights of all the unfortunate.
PRO.31.9	Open your mouth, judge righteously,
PRO.31.9	And defend the rights of the afflicted and needy.
PRO.31.10	An excellent wife, who can find?
PRO.31.10	For her worth is far above jewels.
PRO.31.11	The heart of her husband trusts in her,
PRO.31.11	And he will have no lack of gain.
PRO.31.12	She does him good and not evil
PRO.31.12	All the days of her life.
PRO.31.13	She looks for wool and flax
PRO.31.13	And works with her hands in delight.
PRO.31.14	She is like merchant ships;
PRO.31.14	She brings her food from afar.
PRO.31.15	She rises also while it is still night
PRO.31.15	And gives food to her household
PRO.31.15	And portions to her maidens.
PRO.31.16	She considers a field and buys it;
PRO.31.16	From her earnings she plants a vineyard.
PRO.31.17	She girds herself with strength
PRO.31.17	And makes her arms strong.
PRO.31.18	She senses that her gain is good;
PRO.31.18	Her lamp does not go out at night.
PRO.31.19	She stretches out her hands to the distaff,
PRO.31.19	And her hands grasp the spindle.
PRO.31.20	She extends her hand to the poor,
PRO.31.20	And she stretches out her hands to the needy.
PRO.31.21	She is not afraid of the snow for her household,
PRO.31.21	For all her household are clothed with scarlet.
PRO.31.22	She makes coverings for herself;
PRO.31.22	Her clothing is fine linen and purple.
PRO.31.23	Her husband is known in the gates,
PRO.31.23	When he sits among the elders of the land.
PRO.31.24	She makes linen garments and sells 
PRO.31.24	And supplies belts to the tradesmen.
PRO.31.25	Strength and dignity are her clothing,
PRO.31.25	And she smiles at the future.
PRO.31.26	She opens her mouth in wisdom,
PRO.31.26	And the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.
PRO.31.27	She looks well to the ways of her household,
PRO.31.27	And does not eat the bread of idleness.
PRO.31.28	Her children rise up and bless her;
PRO.31.28	Her husband

ECC.1.1	The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
ECC.1.2	“
ECC.1.2	“Vanity of vanities! All is vanity.”
ECC.1.3	What advantage does man have in all his work
ECC.1.3	Which he does under the sun?
ECC.1.4	A generation goes and a generation comes,
ECC.1.4	But the earth remains forever.
ECC.1.5	Also, the sun rises and the sun sets;
ECC.1.5	And hastening to its place it rises there 
ECC.1.6	Blowing toward the south,
ECC.1.6	Then turning toward the north,
ECC.1.6	The wind continues swirling along;
ECC.1.6	And on its circular courses the wind returns.
ECC.1.7	All the rivers flow into the sea,
ECC.1.7	Yet the sea is not full.
ECC.1.7	To the place where the rivers flow,
ECC.1.7	There they flow again.
ECC.1.8	All things are wearisome;
ECC.1.8	Man is not able to tell 
ECC.1.8	The eye is not satisfied with seeing,
ECC.1.8	Nor is the ear filled with hearing.
ECC.1.9	That which has been is that which will be,
ECC.1.9	And that which has been done is that which will be done.
ECC.1.9	So there is nothing new under the sun.
ECC.1.10	Is there anything of which one might say,
ECC.1.10	“See this, it is new”?
ECC.1.10	Already it has existed for ages
ECC.1.10	Which were before us.
ECC.1.11	There is no remembrance of earlier things;
ECC.1.11	And also of the later things which will occur,
ECC.1.11	There will be for them no remembrance
ECC.1.11	Among those who will come later 
ECC.1.12	I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
ECC.1.13	And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom concerning all that has been done under heaven. 
ECC.1.14	I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and striving after wind. 
ECC.1.15	What is crooked cannot be straightened and what is lacking cannot be counted.
ECC.1.16	I said to myself, “Behold, I have magnified and increased wisdom more than all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.” 
ECC.1.17	And I set my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I realized that this also is striving after wind. 
ECC.1.18	Because in much wisdom there is much grief, and increasing knowledge 
ECC.2.1	I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure. So enjoy yourself.” And behold, it too was futility. 
ECC.2.2	I said of laughter, “It is madness,” and of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?” 
ECC.2.3	I explored with my mind 
ECC.2.4	I enlarged my works: I built houses for myself, I planted vineyards for myself; 
ECC.2.5	I made gardens and parks for myself and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees; 
ECC.2.6	I made ponds of water for myself from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees. 
ECC.2.7	I bought male and female slaves and I had homeborn slaves. Also I possessed flocks and herds larger than all who preceded me in Jerusalem. 
ECC.2.8	Also, I collected for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I provided for myself male and female singers and the pleasures of men—many concubines.
ECC.2.9	Then I became great and increased more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also stood by me. 
ECC.2.10	All that my eyes desired I did not refuse them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, for my heart was pleased because of all my labor and this was my reward for all my labor. 
ECC.2.11	Thus I considered all my activities which my hands had done and the labor which I had exerted, and behold all was 
ECC.2.12	So I turned to consider wisdom, madness and folly; for what 
ECC.2.13	And I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness. 
ECC.2.14	The wise man’s eyes are in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I know that one fate befalls them both. 
ECC.2.15	Then I said to myself, “As is the fate of the fool, it will also befall me. Why then have I been extremely wise?” So I said to myself, “This too is vanity.” 
ECC.2.16	For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise man 
ECC.2.17	So I hated life, for the work which had been done under the sun was grievous to me; because everything is futility and striving after wind.
ECC.2.18	Thus I hated all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun, for I must leave it to the man who will come after me. 
ECC.2.19	And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the fruit of my labor for which I have labored by acting wisely under the sun. This too is vanity. 
ECC.2.20	Therefore I completely despaired of all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun. 
ECC.2.21	When there is a man who has labored with wisdom, knowledge and skill, then he gives his legacy to one who has not labored with them. This too is vanity and a great evil. 
ECC.2.22	For what does a man get in all his labor and in his striving with which he labors under the sun? 
ECC.2.23	Because all his days his task is painful and grievous; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is vanity.
ECC.2.24	There is nothing better for a man 
ECC.2.25	For who can eat and who can have enjoyment without Him? 
ECC.2.26	For to a person who is good in His sight He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, while to the sinner He has given the task of gathering and collecting so that he may give to one who is good in God’s sight. This too is vanity and striving after wind.
ECC.3.1	There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time for every event under heaven—
ECC.3.2	A time to give birth and a time to die;
ECC.3.2	A time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted.
ECC.3.3	A time to kill and a time to heal;
ECC.3.3	A time to tear down and a time to build up.
ECC.3.4	A time to weep and a time to laugh;
ECC.3.4	A time to mourn and a time to dance.
ECC.3.5	A time to throw stones and a time to gather stones;
ECC.3.5	A time to embrace and a time to shun embracing.
ECC.3.6	A time to search and a time to give up as lost;
ECC.3.6	A time to keep and a time to throw away.
ECC.3.7	A time to tear apart and a time to sew together;
ECC.3.7	A time to be silent and a time to speak.
ECC.3.8	A time to love and a time to hate;
ECC.3.8	A time for war and a time for peace.
ECC.3.9	What profit is there to the worker from that in which he toils? 
ECC.3.10	I have seen the task which God has given the sons of men with which to occupy themselves.
ECC.3.11	He has made everything 
ECC.3.12	I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good in one’s lifetime; 
ECC.3.13	moreover, that every man who eats and drinks sees good in all his labor—it is the gift of God. 
ECC.3.14	I know that everything God does will remain forever; there is nothing to add to it and there is nothing to take from it, for God has 
ECC.3.15	That which is has been already and that which will be has already been, for God seeks what has passed by.
ECC.3.16	Furthermore, I have seen under the sun 
ECC.3.17	I said to myself, “God will judge both the righteous man and the wicked man,” for a time for every matter and for every deed is there. 
ECC.3.18	I said to myself concerning the sons of men, “God has surely tested them in order for them to see that they are but beasts.” 
ECC.3.19	For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same. As one dies so dies the other; indeed, they all have the same breath and there is no advantage for man over beast, for all is vanity. 
ECC.3.20	All go to the same place. All came from the dust and all return to the dust. 
ECC.3.21	Who knows that the breath of man ascends upward and the breath of the beast descends downward to the earth? 
ECC.3.22	I have seen that nothing is better than that man should be happy in his activities, for that is his lot. For who will bring him to see what will occur after him?
ECC.4.1	Then I looked again at all the acts of oppression which were being done under the sun. And behold 
ECC.4.2	So I congratulated the dead who are already dead more than the living who are still living. 
ECC.4.3	But better 
ECC.4.4	I have seen that every labor and every skill which is done is 
ECC.4.5	The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh. 
ECC.4.6	One hand full of rest is better than two fists full of labor and striving after wind.
ECC.4.7	Then I looked again at vanity under the sun. 
ECC.4.8	There was a certain man without a dependent, having neither a son nor a brother, yet there was no end to all his labor. Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches 
ECC.4.9	Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor. 
ECC.4.10	For if either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up. 
ECC.4.11	Furthermore, if two lie down together they keep warm, but how can one be warm 
ECC.4.12	And if one can overpower him who is alone, two can resist him. A cord of three 
ECC.4.13	A poor yet wise lad is better than an old and foolish king who no longer knows 
ECC.4.14	For he has come out of prison to become king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom. 
ECC.4.15	I have seen all the living under the sun throng to the side of the second lad who replaces him. 
ECC.4.16	There is no end to all the people, to all who were before them, and even the ones who will come later will not be happy with him, for this too is vanity and striving after wind.
ECC.5.1	Guard your steps as you go to the house of God and draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools; for they do not know they are doing evil. 
ECC.5.2	Do not be hasty in word or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few. 
ECC.5.3	For the dream comes through much effort and the voice of a fool through many words.
ECC.5.4	When you make a vow to God, do not be late in paying it; for 
ECC.5.5	It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay. 
ECC.5.6	Do not let your speech cause you to sin and do not say in the presence of the messenger 
ECC.5.7	For in many dreams and in many words there is emptiness. Rather, fear God.
ECC.5.8	If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be shocked at the sight; for one official watches over another official, and there are higher officials over them. 
ECC.5.9	After all, a king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land.
ECC.5.10	He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves abundance 
ECC.5.11	When good things increase, those who consume them increase. So what is the advantage to their owners except to look on? 
ECC.5.12	The sleep of the working man is pleasant, whether he eats little or much; but the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to sleep.
ECC.5.13	There is a grievous evil 
ECC.5.14	When those riches were lost through a bad investment and he had fathered a son, then there was nothing to support him. 
ECC.5.15	As he had come naked from his mother’s womb, so will he return as he came. He will take nothing from the fruit of his labor that he can carry in his hand. 
ECC.5.16	This also is a grievous evil—exactly as a man is born, thus will he die. So what is the advantage to him who toils for the wind? 
ECC.5.17	Throughout his life 
ECC.5.18	Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting: to eat, to drink and enjoy oneself in all one’s labor in which he toils under the sun 
ECC.5.19	Furthermore, as for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, He has also empowered him to eat from them and to receive his reward and rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God. 
ECC.5.20	For he will not often consider the years of his life, because God keeps him occupied with the gladness of his heart.
ECC.6.1	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun and it is prevalent among men— 
ECC.6.2	a man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor so that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires; yet God has not empowered him to eat from them, for a foreigner enjoys them. This is vanity and a severe affliction. 
ECC.6.3	If a man fathers a hundred 
ECC.6.4	for it comes in futility and goes into obscurity; and its name is covered in obscurity. 
ECC.6.5	It never sees the sun and it never knows 
ECC.6.6	Even if the 
ECC.6.7	All a man’s labor is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not satisfied. 
ECC.6.8	For what advantage does the wise man have over the fool? What 
ECC.6.9	What the eyes see is better than what the soul desires. This too is futility and a striving after wind.
ECC.6.10	Whatever exists has already been named, and it is known what man is; for he cannot dispute with him who is stronger than he is. 
ECC.6.11	For there are many words which increase futility. What 
ECC.6.12	For who knows what is good for a man during 
ECC.7.1	A good name is better than a good ointment,
ECC.7.1	And the day of 
ECC.7.2	It is better to go to a house of mourning
ECC.7.2	Than to go to a house of feasting,
ECC.7.2	Because that is the end of every man,
ECC.7.2	And the living takes 
ECC.7.3	Sorrow is better than laughter,
ECC.7.3	For when a face is sad a heart may be happy.
ECC.7.4	The mind of the wise is in the house of mourning,
ECC.7.4	While the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure.
ECC.7.5	It is better to listen to the rebuke of a wise man
ECC.7.5	Than for one to listen to the song of fools.
ECC.7.6	For as the crackling of thorn bushes under a pot,
ECC.7.6	So is the laughter of the fool;
ECC.7.6	And this too is futility.
ECC.7.7	For oppression makes a wise man mad,
ECC.7.7	And a bribe corrupts the heart.
ECC.7.8	The end of a matter is better than its beginning;
ECC.7.8	Patience of spirit is better than haughtiness of spirit.
ECC.7.9	Do not be eager in your heart to be angry,
ECC.7.9	For anger resides in the bosom of fools.
ECC.7.10	Do not say, “Why is it that the former days were better than these?”
ECC.7.10	For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this.
ECC.7.11	Wisdom along with an inheritance is good
ECC.7.11	And an advantage to those who see the sun.
ECC.7.12	For wisdom is protection 
ECC.7.12	But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessors.
ECC.7.13	Consider the work of God,
ECC.7.13	For who is able to straighten what He has bent?
ECC.7.14	In the day of prosperity be happy,
ECC.7.14	But in the day of adversity consider—
ECC.7.14	God has made the one as well as the other
ECC.7.14	So that man will not discover anything 
ECC.7.15	I have seen everything during my lifetime of futility; there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness and there is a wicked man who prolongs 
ECC.7.16	Do not be excessively righteous and do not be overly wise. Why should you ruin yourself? 
ECC.7.17	Do not be excessively wicked and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time? 
ECC.7.18	It is good that you grasp one thing and also not let go of the other; for the one who fears God comes forth with both of them.
ECC.7.19	Wisdom strengthens a wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city. 
ECC.7.20	Indeed, there is not a righteous man on earth who 
ECC.7.21	Also, do not take seriously all words which are spoken, so that you will not hear your servant cursing you. 
ECC.7.22	For you also have realized that you likewise have many times cursed others.
ECC.7.23	I tested all this with wisdom, 
ECC.7.24	What has been is remote and exceedingly mysterious. Who can discover it? 
ECC.7.25	I directed my mind to know, to investigate and to seek wisdom and an explanation, and to know the evil of folly and the foolishness of madness. 
ECC.7.26	And I discovered more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, whose hands are chains. One who is pleasing to God will escape from her, but the sinner will be captured by her.
ECC.7.27	“Behold, I have discovered this,” says the Preacher, “
ECC.7.28	which I am still seeking but have not found. I have found one man among a thousand, but I have not found a woman among all these. 
ECC.7.29	Behold, I have found only this, that God made men upright, but they have sought out many devices.”
ECC.8.1	Who is like the wise man and who knows the interpretation of a matter? A man’s wisdom illumines him and causes his stern face to beam.
ECC.8.2	I say, “Keep the command of the king because of the oath before God. 
ECC.8.3	Do not be in a hurry to leave him. Do not join in an evil matter, for he will do whatever he pleases.” 
ECC.8.4	Since the word of the king is authoritative, who will say to him, “What are you doing?”
ECC.8.5	He who keeps a 
ECC.8.6	For there is a proper time and procedure for every delight, though a man’s trouble is heavy upon him. 
ECC.8.7	If no one knows what will happen, who can tell him when it will happen? 
ECC.8.8	No man has authority to restrain the wind with the wind, or authority over the day of death; and there is no discharge in the time of war, and evil will not deliver those who practice it. 
ECC.8.9	All this I have seen and applied my mind to every deed that has been done under the sun wherein a man has exercised authority over 
ECC.8.10	So then, I have seen the wicked buried, those who used to go in and out from the holy place, and they are 
ECC.8.11	Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed quickly, therefore the hearts of the sons of men among them are given fully to do evil. 
ECC.8.12	Although a sinner does evil a hundred 
ECC.8.13	But it will not be well for the evil man and he will not lengthen his days like a shadow, because he does not fear God.
ECC.8.14	There is futility which is done on the earth, that is, there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked. On the other hand, there are evil men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I say that this too is futility. 
ECC.8.15	So I commended pleasure, for there is nothing good for a man under the sun except to eat and to drink and to be merry, and this will stand by him in his toils 
ECC.8.16	When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the task which has been done on the earth (even though one should never sleep day or night), 
ECC.8.17	and I saw every work of God, 
ECC.9.1	For I have taken all this to my heart and explain it that righteous men, wise men, and their deeds are in the hand of God. Man does not know whether 
ECC.9.2	It is the same for all. There is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked; for the good, for the clean and for the unclean; for the man who offers a sacrifice and for the one who does not sacrifice. As the good man is, so is the sinner; as the swearer is, so is the one who is afraid to swear. 
ECC.9.3	This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one fate for all men. Furthermore, the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil and insanity is in their hearts throughout their lives. Afterwards they 
ECC.9.4	For whoever is joined with all the living, there is hope; surely a live dog is better than a dead lion. 
ECC.9.5	For the living know they will die; but the dead do not know anything, nor have they any longer a reward, for their memory is forgotten. 
ECC.9.6	Indeed their love, their hate and their zeal have already perished, and they will no longer have a share in all that is done under the sun.
ECC.9.7	Go 
ECC.9.8	Let your clothes be white all the time, and let not oil be lacking on your head. 
ECC.9.9	Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of your fleeting life which He has given to you under the sun; for this is your reward in life and in your toil in which you have labored under the sun.
ECC.9.10	Whatever your hand finds to do, do 
ECC.9.11	I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift and the battle is not to the warriors, and neither is bread to the wise nor wealth to the discerning nor favor to men of ability; for time and chance overtake them all. 
ECC.9.12	Moreover, man does not know his time: like fish caught in a treacherous net and birds trapped in a snare, so the sons of men are ensnared at an evil time when it suddenly falls on them.
ECC.9.13	Also this I came to see as wisdom under the sun, and it impressed me. 
ECC.9.14	There was a small city with few men in it and a great king came to it, surrounded it and constructed large siegeworks against it. 
ECC.9.15	But there was found in it a poor wise man and he delivered the city by his wisdom. Yet no one remembered that poor man. 
ECC.9.16	So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” But the wisdom of the poor man is despised and his words are not heeded. 
ECC.9.17	The words of the wise heard in quietness are 
ECC.9.18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
ECC.10.1	Dead flies make a perfumer’s oil stink, so a little foolishness is weightier than wisdom 
ECC.10.2	A wise man’s heart 
ECC.10.3	Even when the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking and he demonstrates to everyone 
ECC.10.4	If the ruler’s temper rises against you, do not abandon your position, because composure allays great offenses.
ECC.10.5	There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like an error which goes forth from the ruler— 
ECC.10.6	folly is set in many exalted places while rich men sit in humble places. 
ECC.10.7	I have seen slaves 
ECC.10.8	He who digs a pit may fall into it, and a serpent may bite him who breaks through a wall. 
ECC.10.9	He who quarries stones may be hurt by them, and he who splits logs may be endangered by them. 
ECC.10.10	If the axe is dull and he does not sharpen 
ECC.10.11	If the serpent bites before being charmed, there is no profit for the charmer. 
ECC.10.12	Words from the mouth of a wise man are gracious, while the lips of a fool consume him; 
ECC.10.13	the beginning of his talking is folly and the end of it is wicked madness. 
ECC.10.14	Yet the fool multiplies words. No man knows what will happen, and who can tell him what will come after him? 
ECC.10.15	The toil of a fool 
ECC.10.16	Woe to you, O land, whose king is a lad and whose princes feast in the morning. 
ECC.10.17	Blessed are you, O land, whose king is of nobility and whose princes eat at the appropriate time—for strength and not for drunkenness. 
ECC.10.18	Through indolence the rafters sag, and through slackness the house leaks. 
ECC.10.19	 prepare a meal for enjoyment, and wine makes life merry, and money is the answer to everything. 
ECC.10.20	Furthermore, in your bedchamber do not curse a king, and in your sleeping rooms do not curse a rich man, for a bird of the heavens will carry the sound and the winged creature will make the matter known.
ECC.11.1	Cast your bread on the surface of the waters, for you will find it after many days.

SNG.4.4	Your neck is like the tower of David,
SNG.4.4	Built with rows of stones
SNG.4.4	On which are hung a thousand shields,

SNG.4.11	And the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	A garden locked is my sister, 
SNG.4.12	A rock garden locked, a spring sealed up.
SNG.4.13	Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates
SNG.4.13	With choice fruits, henna with nard plants,

SNG.4.14	With all the trees of frankincense,
SNG.4.14	Myrrh and aloes, along with all the finest spices.

SNG.5.1	Drink and imbibe deeply, O lovers.”
SNG.5.2	“
SNG.5.2	A voice! My beloved was knocking:

SNG.5.2	My dove, my perfect one!
SNG.5.2	For my head is drenched with dew,
SNG.5.2	My locks with the damp of the night.’
SNG.5.3	I have taken off my dress,
SNG.5.3	How can I put it on 
SNG.5.3	I have washed my feet,
SNG.5.3	How can I dirty them 
SNG.5.4	My beloved extended his hand through the opening,
SNG.5.4	And my feelings were aroused for him.
SNG.5.5	I arose to open to my beloved;
SNG.5.5	And my hands dripped with myrrh,
SNG.5.5	And my fingers with liquid myrrh,
SNG.5.5	On the handles of the bolt.
SNG.5.6	I opened to my beloved,
SNG.5.6	But my beloved had turned away 
SNG.5.6	My heart went out 
SNG.5.6	I searched for him but I did not find him;
SNG.5.6	I called him but he did not answer me.
SNG.5.7	The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me,
SNG.5.7	They struck me 
SNG.5.7	The guardsmen of the walls took away my shawl from me.
SNG.5.8	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.5.8	If you find my beloved,
SNG.5.8	As to what you will tell him:
SNG.5.8	For I am lovesick.”

SNG.5.9	What kind of beloved is your beloved,
SNG.5.9	That thus you adjure us?”
SNG.5.10	“
SNG.5.10	Outstanding among ten thousand.
SNG.5.11	His head is 
SNG.5.11	His locks are 
SNG.5.12	His eyes are like doves
SNG.5.12	Beside streams of water,
SNG.5.12	Bathed in milk,
SNG.5.13	His cheeks are like a bed of balsam,
SNG.5.13	Banks of sweet-scented herbs;
SNG.5.13	His lips are lilies
SNG.5.13	Dripping with liquid myrrh.
SNG.5.14	His hands are rods of gold
SNG.5.14	Set with beryl;
SNG.5.14	His abdomen is carved ivory
SNG.5.14	Inlaid with sapphires.
SNG.5.15	His legs are pillars of alabaster
SNG.5.15	Set on pedestals of pure gold;
SNG.5.15	His appearance is like Lebanon
SNG.5.15	Choice as the cedars.
SNG.5.16	His mouth is 
SNG.5.16	And he is wholly desirable.
SNG.5.16	This is my beloved and this is my friend,

SNG.6.1	“
SNG.6.1	O most beautiful among women?
SNG.6.1	Where has your beloved turned,
SNG.6.1	That we may seek him with you?”
SNG.6.2	“
SNG.6.2	To the beds of balsam,
SNG.6.2	To pasture 
SNG.6.2	And gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine,
SNG.6.3	He who pastures 
SNG.6.4	“
SNG.6.4	As lovely as Jerusalem,
SNG.6.4	As awesome as an army with banners.
SNG.6.5	Turn your eyes away from me,
SNG.6.5	For they have confused me;
SNG.6.5	Your hair is like a flock of goats
SNG.6.5	That have descended from Gilead.
SNG.6.6	Your teeth are like a flock of ewes
SNG.6.6	Which have come up from 
SNG.6.6	All of which bear twins,
SNG.6.6	And not one among them has lost her young.
SNG.6.7	Your temples are like a slice of a pomegranate
SNG.6.7	Behind your veil.
SNG.6.8	There are sixty queens and eighty concubines,
SNG.6.8	And maidens without number;
SNG.6.9	She is her mother’s only 
SNG.6.9	She is the pure 
SNG.6.9	The maidens saw her and called her blessed,
SNG.6.9	The queens and the concubines

SNG.6.10	As beautiful as the full moon,
SNG.6.10	As pure as the sun,
SNG.6.10	As awesome as an army with banners?’
SNG.6.11	I went down to the orchard of nut trees
SNG.6.11	To see the blossoms of the valley,
SNG.6.11	To see whether the vine had budded
SNG.6.12	Before I was aware, my soul set me
SNG.6.13	“
SNG.6.13	Come back, come back, that we may gaze at you!”
SNG.6.13	“
SNG.6.13	As at the dance of the two companies?
SNG.7.1	“How beautiful are your feet in sandals,
SNG.7.1	O prince’s daughter!
SNG.7.1	The curves of your hips are like jewels,
SNG.7.1	The work of the hands of an artist.
SNG.7.2	Your navel is 
SNG.7.2	Which never lacks mixed wine;
SNG.7.2	Your belly is like a heap of wheat
SNG.7.2	Fenced about with lilies.
SNG.7.3	Your two breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.7.3	Twins of a gazelle.
SNG.7.4	Your neck is like a tower of ivory,
SNG.7.4	Your eyes 
SNG.7.4	By the gate of Bath-rabbim;
SNG.7.4	Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon,
SNG.7.4	Which faces toward Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Your head crowns you like Carmel,
SNG.7.5	And the flowing locks of your head are like purple threads;
SNG.7.6	How beautiful and how delightful you are,
SNG.7.7	Your stature is like a palm tree,
SNG.7.7	And your breasts are 
SNG.7.8	I said, ‘I will climb the palm tree,
SNG.7.8	I will take hold of its fruit stalks.’
SNG.7.8	Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine,
SNG.7.8	And the fragrance of your breath like apples,
SNG.7.9	And your mouth like the best wine!”

SNG.7.9	Flowing gently 
SNG.7.10	“I am my beloved’s,
SNG.7.10	And his desire is for me.
SNG.7.11	Come, my beloved, let us go out into the country,
SNG.7.11	Let us spend the night in the villages.
SNG.7.12	Let us rise early 
SNG.7.12	Let us see whether the vine has budded
SNG.7.12	There I will give you my love.
SNG.7.13	The mandrakes have given forth fragrance;
SNG.7.13	And over our doors are all choice 
SNG.7.13	Both new and old,
SNG.7.13	Which I have saved up for you, my beloved.
SNG.8.1	“Oh that you were like a brother to me
SNG.8.1	Who nursed at my mother’s breasts.
SNG.8.1	No one would despise me, either.
SNG.8.2	I would lead you 
SNG.8.2	Into the house of my mother, who used to instruct me;
SNG.8.2	I would give you spiced wine to drink from the juice of my pomegranates.
SNG.8.3	Let his left hand be under my head
SNG.8.3	And his right hand embrace me.”
SNG.8.4	“
SNG.8.4	Do not arouse or awaken 
SNG.8.4	Until she pleases.”
SNG.8.5	“
SNG.8.5	Leaning on her beloved?”
SNG.8.5	“
SNG.8.5	There your mother was in labor with you,
SNG.8.5	There she was in labor 
SNG.8.6	Put me like a 
SNG.8.6	Like a seal on your arm.
SNG.8.6	For love is as strong as death,
SNG.8.6	Jealousy is as severe as Sheol;
SNG.8.6	Its flashes are flashes of fire,
SNG.8.6	The 
SNG.8.7	Many waters cannot quench love,
SNG.8.7	Nor will rivers overflow it;
SNG.8.7	If a man were to give all the riches of his house for love,
SNG.8.7	It would be utterly despised.”
SNG.8.8	“
SNG.8.8	And she has no breasts;
SNG.8.8	What shall we do for our sister
SNG.8.8	On the day when she is spoken for?
SNG.8.9	If she is a wall,
SNG.8.9	We will build on her a battlement of silver;
SNG.8.9	But if she is a door,
SNG.8.9	We will barricade her with planks of cedar.”
SNG.8.10	“
SNG.8.10	Then I became in his eyes as one who finds peace.
SNG.8.11	Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;
SNG.8.11	He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers.

ISA.1.19	If you consent and obey,
ISA.1.19	You will eat the best of the land;
ISA.1.20	But if you refuse and rebel,
ISA.1.20	You will be devoured by the sword.”
ISA.1.20	Truly, the mouth of the L
ISA.1.21	How the faithful city has become a harlot,
ISA.1.21	She 
ISA.1.21	Righteousness once lodged in her,
ISA.1.21	But now murderers.
ISA.1.22	Your silver has become dross,
ISA.1.22	Your drink diluted with water.
ISA.1.23	Your rulers are rebels
ISA.1.23	And companions of thieves;
ISA.1.23	Everyone loves a bribe
ISA.1.23	And chases after rewards.
ISA.1.23	They do not defend the orphan,
ISA.1.23	Nor does the widow’s plea come before them.
ISA.1.24	Therefore the Lord G
ISA.1.24	The Mighty One of Israel, declares,
ISA.1.24	“Ah, I will be relieved of My adversaries
ISA.1.24	And avenge Myself on My foes.
ISA.1.25	I will also turn My hand against you,
ISA.1.25	And will smelt away your dross as with lye
ISA.1.25	And will remove all your alloy.
ISA.1.26	Then I will restore your judges as at the first,
ISA.1.26	And your counselors as at the beginning;
ISA.1.26	After that you will be called the city of righteousness,
ISA.1.26	A faithful city.”
ISA.1.27	Zion will be redeemed with justice
ISA.1.27	And her repentant ones with righteousness.
ISA.1.28	But transgressors and sinners will be crushed together,
ISA.1.28	And those who forsake the L
ISA.1.29	Surely you will be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,
ISA.1.29	And you will be embarrassed at the gardens which you have chosen.
ISA.1.30	For you will be like an oak whose leaf fades away
ISA.1.30	Or as a garden that has no water.
ISA.1.31	The strong man will become tinder,
ISA.1.31	His work also a spark.
ISA.1.31	Thus they shall both burn together
ISA.1.31	And there will be none to quench 
ISA.2.1	The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
ISA.2.2	Now it will come about that
ISA.2.2	In the last days
ISA.2.2	The mountain of the house of the L
ISA.2.2	Will be established as the chief of the mountains,
ISA.2.2	And will be raised above the hills;
ISA.2.2	And all the nations will stream to it.
ISA.2.3	And many peoples will come and say,
ISA.2.3	“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the L
ISA.2.3	To the house of the God of Jacob;
ISA.2.3	That He may teach us concerning His ways
ISA.2.3	And that we may walk in His paths.”
ISA.2.3	For the law will go forth from Zion
ISA.2.3	And the word of the L
ISA.2.4	And He will judge between the nations,
ISA.2.4	And will render decisions for many peoples;
ISA.2.4	And they will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.
ISA.2.4	Nation will not lift up sword against nation,
ISA.2.4	And never again will they learn war.
ISA.2.5	Come, house of Jacob, and let us walk in the light of the L
ISA.2.6	For You have abandoned Your people, the house of Jacob,
ISA.2.6	Because they are filled 
ISA.2.6	And 
ISA.2.6	And they strike 
ISA.2.7	Their land has also been filled with silver and gold
ISA.2.7	And there is no end to their treasures;
ISA.2.7	Their land has also been filled with horses
ISA.2.7	And there is no end to their chariots.
ISA.2.8	Their land has also been filled with idols;
ISA.2.8	They worship the work of their hands,
ISA.2.8	That which their fingers have made.
ISA.2.9	So the 
ISA.2.9	And the man 
ISA.2.9	But do not forgive them.
ISA.2.10	Enter the rock and hide in the dust
ISA.2.10	From the terror of the L
ISA.2.11	The proud look of man will be abased
ISA.2.11	And the loftiness of man will be humbled,
ISA.2.11	And the L
ISA.2.12	For the L
ISA.2.12	Against everyone who is proud and lofty
ISA.2.12	And against everyone who is lifted up,
ISA.2.12	That he may be abased.
ISA.2.13	And 
ISA.2.13	Against all the oaks of Bashan,
ISA.2.14	Against all the lofty mountains,
ISA.2.14	Against all the hills that are lifted up,
ISA.2.15	Against every high tower,
ISA.2.15	Against every fortified wall,
ISA.2.16	Against all the ships of Tarshish
ISA.2.16	And against all the beautiful craft.
ISA.2.17	The pride of man will be humbled
ISA.2.17	And the loftiness of men will be abased;
ISA.2.17	And the L
ISA.2.18	But the idols will completely vanish.
ISA.2.19	And into holes of the ground
ISA.2.19	Before the terror of the L
ISA.2.19	And the splendor of His majesty,
ISA.2.19	When He arises to make the earth tremble.
ISA.2.20	In that day men will cast away to the moles and the bats
ISA.2.20	Their idols of silver and their idols of gold,
ISA.2.20	Which they made for themselves to worship,
ISA.2.21	In order to go into the caverns of the rocks and the clefts of the cliffs
ISA.2.21	Before the terror of the L
ISA.2.21	When He arises to make the earth tremble.
ISA.2.22	Stop regarding man, whose breath 
ISA.2.22	For why should he be esteemed?
ISA.3.1	For behold, the Lord G
ISA.3.1	Both supply and support, the whole supply of bread
ISA.3.1	And the whole supply of water;
ISA.3.2	The mighty man and the warrior,
ISA.3.2	The judge and the prophet,
ISA.3.2	The diviner and the elder,
ISA.3.3	The captain of fifty and the honorable man,
ISA.3.3	The counselor and the expert artisan,
ISA.3.3	And the skillful enchanter.
ISA.3.4	And I will make mere lads their princes,
ISA.3.4	And capricious children will rule over them,
ISA.3.5	And the people will be oppressed,
ISA.3.5	Each one by another, and each one by his neighbor;
ISA.3.5	The youth will storm against the elder
ISA.3.5	And the inferior against the honorable.
ISA.3.6	When a man lays hold of his brother in his father’s house, 
ISA.3.6	“You have a cloak, you shall be our ruler,
ISA.3.6	And these ruins will be under your charge,”
ISA.3.7	He will protest on that day, saying,
ISA.3.7	“I will not be 
ISA.3.7	For in my house there is neither bread nor cloak;
ISA.3.7	You should not appoint me ruler of the people.”
ISA.3.8	For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen,
ISA.3.8	Because their speech and their actions are against the L
ISA.3.8	To rebel against His glorious presence.
ISA.3.9	The expression of their faces bears witness against them,
ISA.3.9	And they display their sin like Sodom;
ISA.3.9	They do not 
ISA.3.9	Woe to them!
ISA.3.9	For they have brought evil on themselves.
ISA.3.10	Say to the righteous that 
ISA.3.10	For they will eat the fruit of their actions.
ISA.3.11	Woe to the wicked! 
ISA.3.11	For what he deserves will be done to him.
ISA.3.12	O My people! Their oppressors are children,
ISA.3.12	And women rule over them.
ISA.3.12	O My people! Those who guide you lead 
ISA.3.12	And confuse the direction of your paths.
ISA.3.13	The L
ISA.3.13	And stands to judge the people.
ISA.3.14	The L
ISA.3.14	“It is you who have devoured the vineyard;
ISA.3.14	The plunder of the poor is in your houses.
ISA.3.15	What do you mean by crushing My people
ISA.3.15	And grinding the face of the poor?”
ISA.3.15	Declares the Lord G
ISA.3.16	Moreover, the L
ISA.3.16	And walk with heads held high and seductive eyes,
ISA.3.16	And go along with mincing steps
ISA.3.16	And tinkle the bangles on their feet,
ISA.3.17	Therefore the Lord will afflict the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs,
ISA.3.17	And the L
ISA.3.18	In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of 
ISA.3.19	dangling earrings, bracelets, veils, 
ISA.3.20	headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, amulets, 
ISA.3.21	finger rings, nose rings, 
ISA.3.22	festal robes, outer tunics, cloaks, money purses, 
ISA.3.23	hand mirrors, undergarments, turbans and veils.
ISA.3.24	Now it will come about that instead of sweet perfume there will be putrefaction;
ISA.3.24	Instead of a belt, a rope;
ISA.3.24	Instead of well-set hair, a plucked-out scalp;
ISA.3.24	Instead of fine clothes, a donning of sackcloth;
ISA.3.24	And branding instead of beauty.
ISA.3.25	Your men will fall by the sword
ISA.3.25	And your mighty ones in battle.
ISA.3.26	And her gates will lament and mourn,
ISA.3.26	And deserted she will sit on the ground.
ISA.4.1	For seven women will take hold of one man in that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by your name; take away our reproach!”
ISA.4.2	In that day the Branch of the L
ISA.4.3	It will come about that he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy—everyone who is recorded for life in Jerusalem. 
ISA.4.4	When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and purged the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning, 
ISA.4.5	then the L
ISA.4.6	There will be a shelter to 
ISA.5.1	Let me sing now for my well-beloved
ISA.5.1	A song of my beloved concerning His vineyard.
ISA.5.1	My well-beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hill.
ISA.5.2	He dug it all around, removed its stones,
ISA.5.2	And planted it with the choicest vine.
ISA.5.2	And He built a tower in the middle of it
ISA.5.2	And also hewed out a wine vat in it;
ISA.5.2	Then He expected 
ISA.5.2	But it produced 
ISA.5.3	“And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,
ISA.5.3	Judge between Me and My vineyard.
ISA.5.4	What more was there to do for My vineyard that I have not done in it?
ISA.5.4	Why, when I expected 
ISA.5.5	So now let Me tell you what I am going to do to My vineyard:
ISA.5.5	I will remove its hedge and it will be consumed;
ISA.5.5	I will break down its wall and it will become trampled ground.
ISA.5.6	I will lay it waste;
ISA.5.6	It will not be pruned or hoed,
ISA.5.6	But briars and thorns will come up.
ISA.5.6	I will also charge the clouds to rain no rain on it.”
ISA.5.7	For the vineyard of the L
ISA.5.7	And the men of Judah His delightful plant.
ISA.5.7	Thus He looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed;
ISA.5.7	For righteousness, but behold, a cry of distress.
ISA.5.8	Woe to those who add house to house 
ISA.5.8	Until there is no more room,
ISA.5.8	So that you have to live alone in the midst of the land!
ISA.5.9	In my ears the L
ISA.5.10	For ten acres of vineyard will yield 
ISA.5.10	And a homer of seed will yield 
ISA.5.11	Woe to those who rise early in the morning that they may pursue strong drink,
ISA.5.11	Who stay up late in the evening that wine may inflame them!
ISA.5.12	Their banquets are 
ISA.5.12	But they do not pay attention to the deeds of the L
ISA.5.12	Nor do they consider the work of His hands.
ISA.5.13	Therefore My people go into exile for their lack of knowledge;
ISA.5.13	And their honorable men are famished,
ISA.5.13	And their multitude is parched with thirst.
ISA.5.14	Therefore Sheol has enlarged its throat and opened its mouth without measure;
ISA.5.14	And Jerusalem’s splendor, her multitude, her din 
ISA.5.15	So the 
ISA.5.15	The eyes of the proud also will be abased.
ISA.5.16	But the L
ISA.5.16	And the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness.
ISA.5.17	Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture,
ISA.5.17	And strangers will eat in the waste places of the wealthy.
ISA.5.18	Woe to those who drag iniquity with the cords of falsehood,
ISA.5.18	And sin as if with cart ropes;
ISA.5.19	Who say, “Let Him make speed, let Him hasten His work, that we may see 
ISA.5.19	And let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near
ISA.5.19	And come to pass, that we may know 
ISA.5.20	Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;
ISA.5.20	Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness;
ISA.5.20	Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
ISA.5.21	Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes
ISA.5.21	And clever in their own sight!
ISA.5.22	Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine
ISA.5.22	And valiant men in mixing strong drink,
ISA.5.23	Who justify the wicked for a bribe,
ISA.5.23	And take away the rights of the ones who are in the right!
ISA.5.24	Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes stubble
ISA.5.24	And dry grass collapses into the flame,
ISA.5.24	So their root will become like rot and their blossom blow away as dust;
ISA.5.24	For they have rejected the law of the L
ISA.5.24	And despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.5.25	On this account the anger of the L
ISA.5.25	And He has stretched out His hand against them and struck them down.
ISA.5.25	And the mountains quaked, and their corpses lay like refuse in the middle of the streets.
ISA.5.25	For all this His anger is not spent,
ISA.5.25	But His hand is still stretched out.
ISA.5.26	He will also lift up a standard to the distant nation,
ISA.5.26	And will whistle for it from the ends of the earth;
ISA.5.26	And behold, it will come with speed swiftly.
ISA.5.27	No one in it is weary or stumbles,
ISA.5.27	None slumbers or sleeps;
ISA.5.27	Nor is the belt at its waist undone,
ISA.5.27	Nor its sandal strap broken.
ISA.5.28	Its arrows are sharp and all its bows are bent;
ISA.5.28	The hoofs of its horses seem like flint and its 
ISA.5.29	Its roaring is like a lioness, and it roars like young lions;
ISA.5.29	It growls as it seizes the prey
ISA.5.29	And carries 
ISA.5.30	And it will growl over it in that day like the roaring of the sea.
ISA.5.30	If one looks to the land, behold, there is darkness 
ISA.5.30	Even the light is darkened by its clouds.
ISA.6.1	In the year of King Uzziah’s death I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, lofty and exalted, with the train of His robe filling the temple. 
ISA.6.2	Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 
ISA.6.3	And one called out to another and said,
ISA.6.3	“Holy, Holy, Holy, is the L
ISA.6.3	The whole earth is full of His glory.”
ISA.6.4	And the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out, while the temple was filling with smoke. 
ISA.6.5	Then I said,
ISA.6.5	“Woe is me, for I am ruined!
ISA.6.5	Because I am a man of unclean lips,
ISA.6.5	And I live among a people of unclean lips;
ISA.6.5	For my eyes have seen the King, the L
ISA.6.6	Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with tongs. 
ISA.6.7	He touched my mouth 
ISA.6.8	Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?” Then I said, “Here am I. Send me!” 
ISA.6.9	He said, “Go, and tell this people:
ISA.6.9	‘Keep on listening, but do not perceive;
ISA.6.9	Keep on looking, but do not understand.’
ISA.6.10	Render the hearts of this people insensitive,
ISA.6.10	Their ears dull,
ISA.6.10	And their eyes dim,
ISA.6.10	Otherwise they might see with their eyes,
ISA.6.10	Hear with their ears,
ISA.6.10	Understand with their hearts,
ISA.6.10	And return and be healed.”
ISA.6.11	Then I said, “Lord, how long?” And He answered,
ISA.6.11	“Until cities are devastated 
ISA.6.11	Houses are without people
ISA.6.11	And the land is utterly desolate,
ISA.6.12	The L
ISA.6.12	And the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.
ISA.6.13	Yet there will be a tenth portion in it,
ISA.6.13	And it will again be 
ISA.6.13	Like a terebinth or an oak
ISA.6.13	Whose stump remains when it is felled.
ISA.6.13	The holy seed is its stump.”
ISA.7.1	Now it came about in the days of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to 
ISA.7.2	When it was reported to the house of David, saying, “The Arameans have camped in Ephraim,” his heart and the hearts of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake with the wind.
ISA.7.3	Then the L
ISA.7.4	and say to him, ‘Take care and be calm, have no fear and do not be fainthearted because of these two stubs of smoldering firebrands, on account of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah. 
ISA.7.5	Because Aram, 
ISA.7.6	“Let us go up against Judah and terrorize it, and make for ourselves a breach in its walls and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,” 
ISA.7.7	thus says the Lord G
ISA.7.8	For the head of Aram is Damascus and the head of Damascus is Rezin (now within another 65 years Ephraim will be shattered, 
ISA.7.9	and the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you will not believe, you surely shall not last.” ’ ”
ISA.7.10	Then the L
ISA.7.11	“Ask a sign for yourself from the L
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, nor will I test the L
ISA.7.13	Then he said, “Listen now, O house of David! Is it too slight a thing for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God as well? 
ISA.7.14	Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name 
ISA.7.15	He will eat curds and honey at the time He knows 
ISA.7.16	For before the boy will know 
ISA.7.17	The L
ISA.7.18	In that day the L
ISA.7.19	They will all come and settle on the steep ravines, on the ledges of the cliffs, on all the thorn bushes and on all the watering places.
ISA.7.20	In that day the Lord will shave with a razor, hired from regions beyond the Euphrates (
ISA.7.21	Now in that day a man may keep alive a heifer and a pair of sheep; 
ISA.7.22	and because of the abundance of the milk produced he will eat curds, for everyone that is left within the land will eat curds and honey.
ISA.7.23	And it will come about in that day, that every place where there used to be a thousand vines, 
ISA.7.24	 will come there with bows and arrows because all the land will be briars and thorns. 
ISA.7.25	As for all the hills which used to be cultivated with the hoe, you will not go there for fear of briars and thorns; but they will become a place for pasturing oxen and for sheep to trample.
ISA.8.1	Then the L
ISA.8.2	And I will take to Myself faithful witnesses for testimony, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.” 
ISA.8.3	So I approached the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. Then the L
ISA.8.4	for before the boy knows how to cry out ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.”
ISA.8.5	Again the L
ISA.8.6	“Inasmuch as these people have rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah
ISA.8.6	And rejoice in Rezin and the son of Remaliah;
ISA.8.7	Now therefore, behold, the Lord is about to bring on them the strong and abundant waters of the Euphrates,
ISA.8.7	And it will rise up over all its channels and go over all its banks.
ISA.8.8	Then it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass through,
ISA.8.8	It will reach even to the neck;
ISA.8.8	And the spread of its wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.
ISA.8.9	“Be broken, O peoples, and be shattered;
ISA.8.9	And give ear, all remote places of the earth.
ISA.8.9	Gird yourselves, yet be shattered;
ISA.8.9	Gird yourselves, yet be shattered.
ISA.8.10	Devise a plan, but it will be thwarted;
ISA.8.10	State a proposal, but it will not stand,
ISA.8.10	For God is with us.”
ISA.8.11	For thus the L
ISA.8.12	“You are not to say, ‘
ISA.8.12	In regard to all that this people call a conspiracy,
ISA.8.12	And you are not to fear what they fear or be in dread of 
ISA.8.13	It is the L
ISA.8.13	And He shall be your fear,
ISA.8.13	And He shall be your dread.
ISA.8.14	Then He shall become a sanctuary;
ISA.8.14	But to both the houses of Israel, a stone to strike and a rock to stumble over,
ISA.8.15	Many will stumble over them,
ISA.8.15	Then they will fall and be broken;
ISA.8.15	They will even be snared and caught.”
ISA.8.16	Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. 
ISA.8.17	And I will wait for the L
ISA.8.18	Behold, I and the children whom the L
ISA.8.19	When they say to you, “Consult the mediums and the spiritists who whisper and mutter,” should not a people consult their God? 
ISA.8.20	To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn. 
ISA.8.21	They will pass through the land hard-pressed and famished, and it will turn out that when they are hungry, they will be enraged and curse their king and their God as they face upward. 
ISA.8.22	Then they will look to the earth, and behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and 
ISA.9.1	But there will be no 
ISA.9.2	The people who walk in darkness
ISA.9.2	Will see a great light;
ISA.9.2	Those who live in a dark land,
ISA.9.2	The light will shine on them.
ISA.9.3	You shall multiply the nation,
ISA.9.3	You shall increase their gladness;
ISA.9.3	They will be glad in Your presence
ISA.9.3	As with the gladness of harvest,
ISA.9.3	As men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
ISA.9.4	For You shall break the yoke of their burden and the staff on their shoulders,
ISA.9.4	The rod of their oppressor, as at the battle of Midian.
ISA.9.5	For every boot of the booted warrior in the 
ISA.9.5	And cloak rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire.
ISA.9.6	For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us;
ISA.9.6	And the government will rest on His shoulders;
ISA.9.6	And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
ISA.9.6	Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.
ISA.9.7	There will be no end to the increase of 
ISA.9.7	On the throne of David and over his kingdom,
ISA.9.7	To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness
ISA.9.7	From then on and forevermore.
ISA.9.7	The zeal of the L
ISA.9.8	The Lord sends a message against Jacob,
ISA.9.8	And it falls on Israel.
ISA.9.9	And all the people know 
ISA.9.9	Asserting in pride and in arrogance of heart:
ISA.9.10	“The bricks have fallen down,
ISA.9.10	But we will rebuild with smooth stones;
ISA.9.10	The sycamores have been cut down,
ISA.9.10	But we will replace 
ISA.9.11	Therefore the L
ISA.9.11	And spurs their enemies on,
ISA.9.12	The Arameans on the east and the Philistines on the west;
ISA.9.12	And they devour Israel with gaping jaws.
ISA.9.12	In 
ISA.9.12	And His hand is still stretched out.
ISA.9.13	Yet the people do not turn back to Him who struck them,
ISA.9.13	Nor do they seek the L
ISA.9.14	So the L
ISA.9.15	The head is the elder and honorable man,
ISA.9.15	And the prophet who teaches falsehood is the tail.
ISA.9.16	For those who guide this people are leading 
ISA.9.16	And those who are guided by them are brought to confusion.
ISA.9.17	Therefore the Lord does not take pleasure in their young men,
ISA.9.17	Nor does He have pity on their orphans or their widows;
ISA.9.17	For every one of them is godless and an evildoer,
ISA.9.17	And every mouth is speaking foolishness.
ISA.9.17	In 
ISA.9.17	And His hand is still stretched out.
ISA.9.18	For wickedness burns like a fire;
ISA.9.18	It consumes briars and thorns;
ISA.9.18	It even sets the thickets of the forest aflame
ISA.9.18	And they roll upward in a column of smoke.
ISA.9.19	By the fury of the L
ISA.9.19	And the people are like fuel for the fire;
ISA.9.19	No man spares his brother.
ISA.9.20	They slice off 
ISA.9.20	And they eat 
ISA.9.20	Each of them eats the flesh of his own arm.
ISA.9.21	Manasseh 
ISA.9.21	In 
ISA.9.21	And His hand is still stretched out.
ISA.10.1	Woe to those who enact evil statutes
ISA.10.1	And to those who constantly record unjust decisions,
ISA.10.2	So as to deprive the needy of justice
ISA.10.2	And rob the poor of My people of 
ISA.10.2	So that widows may be their spoil
ISA.10.2	And that they may plunder the orphans.
ISA.10.3	Now what will you do in the day of punishment,
ISA.10.3	And in the devastation which will come from afar?
ISA.10.3	To whom will you flee for help?
ISA.10.3	And where will you leave your wealth?
ISA.10.4	Nothing 
ISA.10.4	Or fall among the slain.
ISA.10.4	In 
ISA.10.4	And His hand is still stretched out.
ISA.10.5	Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger
ISA.10.5	And the staff in whose hands is My indignation,
ISA.10.6	I send it against a godless nation
ISA.10.6	And commission it against the people of My fury
ISA.10.6	To capture booty and to seize plunder,
ISA.10.6	And to trample them down like mud in the streets.
ISA.10.7	Yet it does not so intend,
ISA.10.7	Nor does it plan so in its heart,
ISA.10.7	But rather it is its purpose to destroy
ISA.10.7	And to cut off many nations.
ISA.10.8	For it says, “Are not my princes all kings?
ISA.10.9	Is not Calno like Carchemish,
ISA.10.9	Or Hamath like Arpad,
ISA.10.9	Or Samaria like Damascus?
ISA.10.10	As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols,
ISA.10.10	Whose graven images 
ISA.10.11	Shall I not do to Jerusalem and her images
ISA.10.11	Just as I have done to Samaria and her idols?”
ISA.10.12	So it will be that when the Lord has completed all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, 
ISA.10.13	For he has said,
ISA.10.13	“By the power of my hand and by my wisdom I did 
ISA.10.13	For I have understanding;
ISA.10.13	And I removed the boundaries of the peoples
ISA.10.13	And plundered their treasures,
ISA.10.13	And like a mighty man I brought down 
ISA.10.14	And my hand reached to the riches of the peoples like a nest,
ISA.10.14	And as one gathers abandoned eggs, I gathered all the earth;
ISA.10.14	And there was not one that flapped its wing or opened 
ISA.10.15	Is the axe to boast itself over the one who chops with it?
ISA.10.15	Is the saw to exalt itself over the one who wields it?
ISA.10.16	Therefore the Lord, the G
ISA.10.16	And under his glory a fire will be kindled like a burning flame.
ISA.10.17	And the light of Israel will become a fire and his Holy One a flame,
ISA.10.17	And it will burn and devour his thorns and his briars in a single day.
ISA.10.18	And He will destroy the glory of his forest and of his fruitful garden, both soul and body,
ISA.10.18	And it will be as when a sick man wastes away.
ISA.10.19	And the rest of the trees of his forest will be so small in number
ISA.10.19	That a child could write them down.
ISA.10.20	Now in that day the remnant of Israel, and those of the house of Jacob who have escaped, will never again rely on the one who struck them, but will truly rely on the L
ISA.10.21	A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
ISA.10.22	For though your people, O Israel, may be like the sand of the sea,
ISA.10.22	A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.
ISA.10.23	For a complete destruction, one that is decreed, the Lord G
ISA.10.24	Therefore thus says the Lord G
ISA.10.25	For in a very little while My indignation 
ISA.10.26	The L
ISA.10.27	So it will be in that day, that his burden will be removed from your shoulders and his yoke from your neck, and the yoke will be broken because of fatness.
ISA.10.28	He has come against Aiath,
ISA.10.28	He has passed through Migron;
ISA.10.28	At Michmash he deposited his baggage.
ISA.10.29	They have gone through the pass, 
ISA.10.29	“Geba will be our lodging place.”
ISA.10.29	Ramah is terrified, and Gibeah of Saul has fled away.
ISA.10.30	Cry aloud with your voice, O daughter of Gallim!
ISA.10.30	Pay attention, Laishah 
ISA.10.31	Madmenah has fled.
ISA.10.31	The inhabitants of Gebim have sought refuge.
ISA.10.32	Yet today he will halt at Nob;
ISA.10.32	He shakes his fist at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
ISA.10.33	Behold, the Lord, the G
ISA.10.33	Those also who are tall in stature will be cut down
ISA.10.33	And those who are lofty will be abased.
ISA.10.34	He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an iron 
ISA.10.34	And Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.
ISA.11.1	Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse,
ISA.11.1	And a branch from his roots will bear fruit.
ISA.11.2	The Spirit of the L
ISA.11.2	The spirit of wisdom and understanding,
ISA.11.2	The spirit of counsel and strength,
ISA.11.2	The spirit of knowledge and the fear of the L
ISA.11.3	And He will delight in the fear of the L
ISA.11.3	And He will not judge by what His eyes see,
ISA.11.3	Nor make a decision by what His ears hear;
ISA.11.4	But with righteousness He will judge the poor,
ISA.11.4	And decide with fairness for the afflicted of the earth;
ISA.11.4	And He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth,
ISA.11.4	And with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked.
ISA.11.5	Also righteousness will be the belt about His loins,
ISA.11.5	And faithfulness the belt about His waist.
ISA.11.6	And the wolf will dwell with the lamb,
ISA.11.6	And the leopard will lie down with the young goat,
ISA.11.6	And the calf and the young lion 
ISA.11.6	And a little boy will lead them.
ISA.11.7	Also the cow and the bear will graze,
ISA.11.7	Their young will lie down together,
ISA.11.7	And the lion will eat straw like the ox.
ISA.11.8	The nursing child will play by the hole of the cobra,
ISA.11.8	And the weaned child will put his hand on the viper’s den.
ISA.11.9	They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain,
ISA.11.9	For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the L
ISA.11.9	As the waters cover the sea.
ISA.11.10	Then in that day
ISA.11.10	The nations will resort to the root of Jesse,
ISA.11.10	Who will stand as a signal for the peoples;
ISA.11.10	And His resting place will be glorious.
ISA.11.11	Then it will happen on that day that the Lord
ISA.11.11	Will again recover the second time with His hand
ISA.11.11	The remnant of His people, who will remain,
ISA.11.11	From Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath,
ISA.11.11	And from the islands of the sea.
ISA.11.12	And He will lift up a standard for the nations
ISA.11.12	And assemble the banished ones of Israel,
ISA.11.12	And will gather the dispersed of Judah
ISA.11.12	From the four corners of the earth.
ISA.11.13	Then the jealousy of Ephraim will depart,
ISA.11.13	And those who harass Judah will be cut off;
ISA.11.13	Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah,
ISA.11.13	And Judah will not harass Ephraim.
ISA.11.14	They will swoop down on the slopes of the Philistines on the west;
ISA.11.14	Together they will plunder the sons of the east;
ISA.11.14	They will possess Edom and Moab,
ISA.11.14	And the sons of Ammon will be subject to them.
ISA.11.15	And the L
ISA.11.15	The tongue of the Sea of Egypt;
ISA.11.15	And He will wave His hand over the River
ISA.11.15	With His scorching wind;
ISA.11.15	And He will strike it into seven streams
ISA.11.15	And make 
ISA.11.16	And there will be a highway from Assyria
ISA.11.16	For the remnant of His people who will be left,
ISA.11.16	Just as there was for Israel
ISA.11.16	In the day that they came up out of the land of Egypt.
ISA.12.1	Then you will say on that day,
ISA.12.1	“I will give thanks to You, O L
ISA.12.1	For although You were angry with me,
ISA.12.1	Your anger is turned away,
ISA.12.1	And You comfort me.
ISA.12.2	Behold, God is my salvation,
ISA.12.2	I will trust and not be afraid;
ISA.12.2	For the L
ISA.12.2	And He has become my salvation.”
ISA.12.3	Therefore you will joyously draw water
ISA.12.3	From the springs of salvation.
ISA.12.4	And in that day you will say,
ISA.12.4	“Give thanks to the L
ISA.12.4	Make known His deeds among the peoples;
ISA.12.4	Make 
ISA.12.5	Praise the L
ISA.12.5	Let this be known throughout the earth.
ISA.12.6	Cry aloud and shout for joy, O inhabitant of Zion,
ISA.12.6	For great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.13.1	The oracle concerning Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.
ISA.13.2	Lift up a standard on the 
ISA.13.2	Raise your voice to them,
ISA.13.2	Wave the hand that they may enter the doors of the nobles.
ISA.13.3	I have commanded My consecrated ones,
ISA.13.3	I have even called My mighty warriors,
ISA.13.3	My proudly exulting ones,
ISA.13.3	To 
ISA.13.4	A sound of tumult on the mountains,
ISA.13.4	Like that of many people!
ISA.13.4	A sound of the uproar of kingdoms,
ISA.13.4	Of nations gathered together!
ISA.13.4	The L
ISA.13.5	They are coming from a far country,
ISA.13.5	From the farthest horizons,
ISA.13.5	The L
ISA.13.5	To destroy the whole land.
ISA.13.6	Wail, for the day of the L
ISA.13.6	It will come as destruction from the Almighty.
ISA.13.7	Therefore all hands will fall limp,
ISA.13.7	And every man’s heart will melt.
ISA.13.8	They will be terrified,
ISA.13.8	Pains and anguish will take hold of 
ISA.13.8	They will writhe like a woman in labor,
ISA.13.8	They will look at one another in astonishment,
ISA.13.8	Their faces aflame.
ISA.13.9	Behold, the day of the L
ISA.13.9	Cruel, with fury and burning anger,
ISA.13.9	To make the land a desolation;
ISA.13.9	And He will exterminate its sinners from it.
ISA.13.10	For the stars of heaven and their constellations
ISA.13.10	Will not flash forth their light;
ISA.13.10	The sun will be dark when it rises
ISA.13.10	And the moon will not shed its light.
ISA.13.11	Thus I will punish the world for its evil
ISA.13.11	And the wicked for their iniquity;
ISA.13.11	I will also put an end to the arrogance of the proud
ISA.13.11	And abase the haughtiness of the ruthless.
ISA.13.12	I will make mortal man scarcer than pure gold
ISA.13.12	And mankind than the gold of Ophir.
ISA.13.13	Therefore I will make the heavens tremble,
ISA.13.13	And the earth will be shaken from its place
ISA.13.13	At the fury of the L
ISA.13.13	In the day of His burning anger.
ISA.13.14	And it will be that like a hunted gazelle,
ISA.13.14	Or like sheep with none to gather 
ISA.13.14	They will each turn to his own people,
ISA.13.14	And each one flee to his own land.
ISA.13.15	Anyone who is found will be thrust through,
ISA.13.15	And anyone who is captured will fall by the sword.
ISA.13.16	Their little ones also will be dashed to pieces
ISA.13.16	Before their eyes;
ISA.13.16	Their houses will be plundered
ISA.13.16	And their wives ravished.
ISA.13.17	Behold, I am going to stir up the Medes against them,
ISA.13.17	Who will not value silver or take pleasure in gold.
ISA.13.18	And 
ISA.13.18	They will not even have compassion on the fruit of the womb,
ISA.13.19	And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, the glory of the Chaldeans’ pride,
ISA.13.19	Will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
ISA.13.20	It will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation;
ISA.13.20	Nor will the Arab pitch 
ISA.13.20	Nor will shepherds make 
ISA.13.21	But desert creatures will lie down there,
ISA.13.21	And their houses will be full of owls;
ISA.13.21	Ostriches also will live there, and shaggy goats will frolic there.
ISA.13.22	Hyenas will howl in their fortified towers
ISA.13.22	And jackals in their luxurious palaces.
ISA.13.22	Her 
ISA.13.22	And her days will not be prolonged.
ISA.14.1	When the L
ISA.14.2	The peoples will take them along and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess them as an inheritance in the land of the L
ISA.14.3	And it will be in the day when the L
ISA.14.4	that you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon, and say,
ISA.14.4	“How the oppressor has ceased,
ISA.14.5	The L
ISA.14.5	The scepter of rulers
ISA.14.6	Which used to strike the peoples in fury with unceasing strokes,
ISA.14.6	Which subdued the nations in anger with unrestrained persecution.
ISA.14.7	The whole earth is at rest 
ISA.14.7	They break forth into shouts of joy.
ISA.14.8	Even the cypress trees rejoice over you, 
ISA.14.8	‘Since you were laid low, no 
ISA.14.9	Sheol from beneath is excited over you to meet you when you come;
ISA.14.9	It arouses for you the spirits of the dead, all the leaders of the earth;
ISA.14.9	It raises all the kings of the nations from their thrones.
ISA.14.10	They will all respond and say to you,
ISA.14.10	‘Even you have been made weak as we,
ISA.14.10	You have become like us.
ISA.14.11	Your pomp 
ISA.14.11	Have been brought down to Sheol;
ISA.14.11	Maggots are spread out 
ISA.14.11	And worms are your covering.’
ISA.14.12	How you have fallen from heaven,
ISA.14.12	O star of the morning, son of the dawn!
ISA.14.12	You have been cut down to the earth,
ISA.14.12	You who have weakened the nations!
ISA.14.13	But you said in your heart,
ISA.14.13	‘I will ascend to heaven;
ISA.14.13	I will raise my throne above the stars of God,
ISA.14.13	And I will sit on the mount of assembly
ISA.14.13	In the recesses of the north.
ISA.14.14	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;
ISA.14.14	I will make myself like the Most High.’
ISA.14.15	Nevertheless you will be thrust down to Sheol,
ISA.14.15	To the recesses of the pit.
ISA.14.16	Those who see you will gaze at you,
ISA.14.16	They will ponder over you, 
ISA.14.16	‘Is this the man who made the earth tremble,
ISA.14.16	Who shook kingdoms,
ISA.14.17	Who made the world like a wilderness
ISA.14.17	And overthrew its cities,
ISA.14.17	Who did not allow his prisoners to 
ISA.14.18	All the kings of the nations lie in glory,
ISA.14.18	Each in his own tomb.
ISA.14.19	But you have been cast out of your tomb
ISA.14.19	Like a rejected branch,
ISA.14.19	Clothed with the slain who are pierced with a sword,
ISA.14.19	Who go down to the stones of the pit
ISA.14.19	Like a trampled corpse.
ISA.14.20	You will not be united with them in burial,
ISA.14.20	Because you have ruined your country,
ISA.14.20	You have slain your people.
ISA.14.20	May the offspring of evildoers not be mentioned forever.
ISA.14.21	Prepare for his sons a place of slaughter
ISA.14.21	Because of the iniquity of their fathers.
ISA.14.21	They must not arise and take possession of the earth
ISA.14.21	And fill the face of the world with cities.”
ISA.14.22	“I will rise up against them,” declares the L
ISA.14.23	“I will also make it a possession for the hedgehog and swamps of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,” declares the L
ISA.14.24	The L
ISA.14.25	to break Assyria in My land, and I will trample him on My mountains. Then his yoke will be removed from them and his burden removed from their shoulder. 
ISA.14.26	This is the plan devised against the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out against all the nations. 
ISA.14.27	For the L
ISA.14.28	In the year that King Ahaz died this oracle came:
ISA.14.29	“Do not rejoice, O Philistia, all of you,
ISA.14.29	Because the rod that struck you is broken;
ISA.14.29	For from the serpent’s root a viper will come out,
ISA.14.29	And its fruit will be a flying serpent.
ISA.14.30	Those who are most helpless will eat,
ISA.14.30	And the needy will lie down in security;
ISA.14.30	I will destroy your root with famine,
ISA.14.30	And it will kill off your survivors.
ISA.14.31	Wail, O gate; cry, O city;
ISA.14.31	Melt away, O Philistia, all of you;
ISA.14.31	For smoke comes from the north,
ISA.14.31	And there is no straggler in his ranks.
ISA.14.32	How then will one answer the messengers of the nation?
ISA.14.32	That the L
ISA.14.32	And the afflicted of His people will seek refuge in it.”
ISA.15.1	The oracle concerning Moab.
ISA.15.1	Surely in a night Ar of Moab is devastated 
ISA.15.1	Surely in a night Kir of Moab is devastated 
ISA.15.2	They have gone up to the temple and 
ISA.15.2	Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba;
ISA.15.2	Everyone’s head is bald 
ISA.15.3	In their streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth;
ISA.15.3	On their housetops and in their squares
ISA.15.3	Everyone is wailing, dissolved in tears.
ISA.15.4	Heshbon and Elealeh also cry out,
ISA.15.4	Their voice is heard all the way to Jahaz;
ISA.15.4	Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud;
ISA.15.4	His soul trembles within him.
ISA.15.5	My heart cries out for Moab;
ISA.15.5	His fugitives are as far as Zoar 
ISA.15.5	For they go up the ascent of Luhith weeping;
ISA.15.5	Surely on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of distress over 
ISA.15.6	For the waters of Nimrim are desolate.
ISA.15.6	Surely the grass is withered, the tender grass died out,
ISA.15.6	There is no green thing.
ISA.15.7	Therefore the abundance 
ISA.15.7	They carry off over the brook of Arabim.
ISA.15.8	For the cry of distress has gone around the territory of Moab,
ISA.15.8	Its wail 
ISA.15.9	For the waters of Dimon are full of blood;
ISA.15.9	Surely I will bring added 
ISA.15.9	A lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon the remnant of the land.
ISA.16.1	Send the 
ISA.16.1	From Sela by way of the wilderness to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.
ISA.16.2	Then, like fleeing birds 
ISA.16.2	The daughters of Moab will be at the fords of the Arnon.
ISA.16.3	“Give 
ISA.16.3	Cast your shadow like night at high noon;
ISA.16.3	Hide the outcasts, do not betray the fugitive.
ISA.16.4	Let the outcasts of Moab stay with you;
ISA.16.4	Be a hiding place to them from the destroyer.”
ISA.16.4	For the extortioner has come to an end, destruction has ceased,
ISA.16.4	Oppressors have completely 
ISA.16.5	A throne will even be established in lovingkindness,
ISA.16.5	And a judge will sit on it in faithfulness in the tent of David;
ISA.16.5	Moreover, he will seek justice
ISA.16.5	And be prompt in righteousness.
ISA.16.6	We have heard of the pride of Moab, an excessive pride;
ISA.16.6	His idle boasts are false.
ISA.16.7	Therefore Moab will wail; everyone of Moab will wail.
ISA.16.7	You will moan for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth
ISA.16.7	As those who are utterly stricken.
ISA.16.8	For the fields of Heshbon have withered, the vines of Sibmah 
ISA.16.8	The lords of the nations have trampled down its choice clusters
ISA.16.8	Which reached as far as Jazer 
ISA.16.8	Its tendrils spread themselves out 
ISA.16.9	Therefore I will weep bitterly for Jazer, for the vine of Sibmah;
ISA.16.9	I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh;
ISA.16.9	For the shouting over your summer fruits and your harvest has fallen away.
ISA.16.10	Gladness and joy are taken away from the fruitful field;
ISA.16.10	In the vineyards also there will be no cries of joy or jubilant shouting,
ISA.16.10	No treader treads out wine in the presses,
ISA.16.11	Therefore my heart intones like a harp for Moab
ISA.16.11	And my inward feelings for Kir-hareseth.
ISA.16.12	So it will come about when Moab presents himself,
ISA.16.12	When he wearies himself upon 
ISA.16.12	And comes to his sanctuary to pray,
ISA.16.12	That he will not prevail.
ISA.16.13	This is the word which the L
ISA.16.14	But now the L
ISA.17.1	The oracle concerning Damascus.
ISA.17.1	“Behold, Damascus is about to be removed from being a city
ISA.17.1	And will become a fallen ruin.
ISA.17.2	The cities of Aroer are forsaken;
ISA.17.2	They will be for flocks to lie down in,
ISA.17.2	And there will be no one to frighten 
ISA.17.3	The fortified city will disappear from Ephraim,
ISA.17.3	And sovereignty from Damascus
ISA.17.3	And the remnant of Aram;
ISA.17.3	They will be like the glory of the sons of Israel,”
ISA.17.3	Declares the L
ISA.17.4	Now in that day the glory of Jacob will fade,
ISA.17.4	And the fatness of his flesh will become lean.
ISA.17.5	It will be even like the reaper gathering the standing grain,
ISA.17.5	As his arm harvests the ears,
ISA.17.5	Or it will be like one gleaning ears of grain
ISA.17.5	In the valley of Rephaim.
ISA.17.6	Yet gleanings will be left in it like the shaking of an olive tree,
ISA.17.6	Two 
ISA.17.6	Four 
ISA.17.6	Declares the L
ISA.17.7	In that day man will have regard for his Maker
ISA.17.7	And his eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.17.8	He will not have regard for the altars, the work of his hands,
ISA.17.8	Nor will he look to that which his fingers have made,
ISA.17.8	Even the 
ISA.17.9	In that day their strong cities will be like forsaken places in the forest,
ISA.17.9	Or like branches which they abandoned before the sons of Israel;
ISA.17.9	And the land will be a desolation.
ISA.17.10	For you have forgotten the God of your salvation
ISA.17.10	And have not remembered the rock of your refuge.
ISA.17.10	Therefore you plant delightful plants
ISA.17.10	And set them with vine slips of a strange 
ISA.17.11	In the day that you plant 
ISA.17.11	And in the morning you bring your seed to blossom;
ISA.17.11	In a day of sickliness and incurable pain.
ISA.17.12	Alas, the uproar of many peoples
ISA.17.12	Who roar like the roaring of the seas,
ISA.17.12	And the rumbling of nations
ISA.17.12	Who rush on like the rumbling of mighty waters!
ISA.17.13	The nations rumble on like the rumbling of many waters,
ISA.17.13	But He will rebuke them and they will flee far away,
ISA.17.13	And be chased like chaff in the mountains before the wind,
ISA.17.13	Or like whirling dust before a gale.
ISA.17.14	At evening time, behold, 
ISA.17.14	Before morning they are no more.
ISA.17.14	Such 
ISA.17.14	And the lot of those who pillage us.
ISA.18.1	Alas, oh land of whirring wings
ISA.18.1	Which lies beyond the rivers of 
ISA.18.2	Which sends envoys by the sea,
ISA.18.2	Even in papyrus vessels on the surface of the waters.
ISA.18.2	Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth,
ISA.18.2	To a people feared far and wide,
ISA.18.2	A powerful and oppressive nation
ISA.18.2	Whose land the rivers divide.
ISA.18.3	All you inhabitants of the world and dwellers on earth,
ISA.18.3	As soon as a standard is raised on the mountains, you will see 
ISA.18.3	And as soon as the trumpet is blown, you will hear 
ISA.18.4	For thus the L
ISA.18.4	“I will look from My dwelling place quietly
ISA.18.4	Like dazzling heat in the sunshine,
ISA.18.4	Like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”
ISA.18.5	For before the harvest, as soon as the bud blossoms
ISA.18.5	And the flower becomes a ripening grape,
ISA.18.5	Then He will cut off the sprigs with pruning knives
ISA.18.5	And remove 
ISA.18.6	They will be left together for mountain birds of prey,
ISA.18.6	And for the beasts of the earth;
ISA.18.6	And the birds of prey will spend the summer 
ISA.18.6	And all the beasts of the earth will spend harvest time on them.
ISA.18.7	At that time a gift of homage will be brought to the L
ISA.18.7	From a people tall and smooth,
ISA.18.7	Even from a people feared far and wide,
ISA.18.7	A powerful and oppressive nation,
ISA.18.7	Whose land the rivers divide—
ISA.18.7	To the place of the name of the L
ISA.19.1	The oracle concerning Egypt.
ISA.19.1	Behold, the L
ISA.19.1	The idols of Egypt will tremble at His presence,
ISA.19.1	And the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them.
ISA.19.2	“So I will incite Egyptians against Egyptians;
ISA.19.2	And they will each fight against his brother and each against his neighbor,
ISA.19.2	City against city 
ISA.19.3	Then the spirit of the Egyptians will be demoralized within them;
ISA.19.3	And I will confound their strategy,
ISA.19.3	So that they will resort to idols and ghosts of the dead
ISA.19.3	And to mediums and spiritists.
ISA.19.4	Moreover, I will deliver the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel master,
ISA.19.4	And a mighty king will rule over them,” declares the Lord G
ISA.19.5	The waters from the sea will dry up,
ISA.19.5	And the river will be parched and dry.
ISA.19.6	The canals will emit a stench,
ISA.19.6	The streams of Egypt will thin out and dry up;
ISA.19.6	The reeds and rushes will rot away.
ISA.19.7	The bulrushes by the Nile, by the edge of the Nile
ISA.19.7	And all the sown fields by the Nile
ISA.19.7	Will become dry, be driven away, and be no more.
ISA.19.8	And the fishermen will lament,
ISA.19.8	And all those who cast a line into the Nile will mourn,
ISA.19.8	And those who spread nets on the waters will pine away.
ISA.19.9	Moreover, the manufacturers of linen made from combed flax
ISA.19.9	And the weavers of white cloth will be utterly dejected.
ISA.19.10	And the pillars 
ISA.19.10	All the hired laborers will be grieved in soul.
ISA.19.11	The princes of Zoan are mere fools;
ISA.19.11	The advice of Pharaoh’s wisest advisers has become stupid.
ISA.19.11	How can you 
ISA.19.11	“I am a son of the wise, a son of ancient kings”?
ISA.19.12	Well then, where are your wise men?
ISA.19.12	Please let them tell you,
ISA.19.12	And let them understand what the L
ISA.19.12	Has purposed against Egypt.
ISA.19.13	The princes of Zoan have acted foolishly,
ISA.19.13	The princes of Memphis are deluded;
ISA.19.13	Have led Egypt astray.
ISA.19.14	The L
ISA.19.14	They have led Egypt astray in all that it does,
ISA.19.14	As a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
ISA.19.15	There will be no work for Egypt
ISA.19.15	Which 
ISA.19.16	In that day the Egyptians will become like women, and they will tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the L
ISA.19.17	The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt; everyone to whom it is mentioned will be in dread of it, because of the purpose of the L
ISA.19.18	In that day five cities in the land of Egypt will be speaking the language of Canaan and swearing 
ISA.19.19	In that day there will be an altar to the L
ISA.19.20	It will become a sign and a witness to the L
ISA.19.21	Thus the L
ISA.19.22	The L
ISA.19.23	In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrians will come into Egypt and the Egyptians into Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
ISA.19.24	In that day Israel will be the third 
ISA.19.25	whom the L
ISA.20.1	In the year that the commander came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashdod and captured it, 
ISA.20.2	at that time the L
ISA.20.3	And the L
ISA.20.4	so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 
ISA.20.5	Then they will be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their hope and Egypt their boast. 
ISA.20.6	So the inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day, ‘Behold, such is our hope, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria; and we, how shall we escape?’ ”
ISA.21.1	The oracle concerning the 
ISA.21.1	As windstorms in the Negev sweep on,
ISA.21.1	It comes from the wilderness, from a terrifying land.
ISA.21.2	A harsh vision has been shown to me;
ISA.21.2	The treacherous one 
ISA.21.2	Go up, Elam, lay siege, Media;
ISA.21.2	I have made an end of all the groaning she has caused.
ISA.21.3	For this reason my loins are full of anguish;
ISA.21.3	Pains have seized me like the pains of a woman in labor.
ISA.21.3	I am so bewildered I cannot hear, so terrified I cannot see.
ISA.21.4	My mind reels, horror overwhelms me;
ISA.21.4	The twilight I longed for has been turned for me into trembling.
ISA.21.5	They set the table, they 
ISA.21.5	“Rise up, captains, oil the shields,”
ISA.21.6	For thus the Lord says to me,
ISA.21.6	“Go, station the lookout, let him report what he sees.
ISA.21.7	When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs,
ISA.21.7	A train of donkeys, a train of camels,
ISA.21.7	Let him pay close attention, very close attention.”
ISA.21.8	Then the lookout called,
ISA.21.8	“O Lord, I stand continually by day on the watchtower,
ISA.21.8	And I am stationed every night at my guard post.
ISA.21.9	Now behold, here comes a troop of riders, horsemen in pairs.”
ISA.21.9	And one said, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon;
ISA.21.9	And all the images of her gods are shattered on the ground.”
ISA.21.10	O my threshed 
ISA.21.10	What I have heard from the L
ISA.21.10	The God of Israel, I make known to you.
ISA.21.11	The oracle concerning Edom.
ISA.21.11	One keeps calling to me from Seir,
ISA.21.11	“Watchman, 
ISA.21.11	Watchman, how far gone is the night?”
ISA.21.12	The watchman says,
ISA.21.12	“Morning comes but also night.
ISA.21.12	If you would inquire, inquire;
ISA.21.12	Come back again.”
ISA.21.13	The oracle about Arabia.
ISA.21.13	In the thickets of Arabia you must spend the night,
ISA.21.13	O caravans of Dedanites.
ISA.21.14	Bring water for the thirsty,
ISA.21.14	O inhabitants of the land of Tema,
ISA.21.14	Meet the fugitive with bread.
ISA.21.15	For they have fled from the swords,
ISA.21.15	From the drawn sword, and from the bent bow
ISA.21.15	And from the press of battle.
ISA.21.16	For thus the Lord said to me, “In a year, as a hired man would count it, all the splendor of Kedar will terminate; 
ISA.21.17	and the remainder of the number of bowmen, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, will be few; for the L
ISA.22.1	The oracle concerning the valley of vision.
ISA.22.1	What is the matter with you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops?
ISA.22.2	You who were full of noise,
ISA.22.2	You boisterous town, you exultant city;
ISA.22.2	Your slain were not slain with the sword,
ISA.22.2	Nor did they die in battle.
ISA.22.3	All your rulers have fled together,
ISA.22.3	All of you who were found were taken captive together,
ISA.22.3	Though they had fled far away.
ISA.22.4	Therefore I say, “Turn your eyes away from me,
ISA.22.4	Let me weep bitterly,
ISA.22.4	Do not try to comfort me concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people.”
ISA.22.5	For the Lord G
ISA.22.5	In the valley of vision,
ISA.22.5	A breaking down of walls
ISA.22.5	And a crying to the mountain.
ISA.22.6	Elam took up the quiver
ISA.22.6	With the chariots, infantry 
ISA.22.6	And Kir uncovered the shield.
ISA.22.7	Then your choicest valleys were full of chariots,
ISA.22.7	And the horsemen took up fixed positions at the gate.
ISA.22.8	And He removed the defense of Judah.
ISA.22.8	In that day you depended on the weapons of the house of the forest,
ISA.22.9	And you saw that the breaches
ISA.22.9	In the 
ISA.22.9	And you collected the waters of the lower pool.
ISA.22.10	Then you counted the houses of Jerusalem
ISA.22.10	And tore down houses to fortify the wall.
ISA.22.11	And you made a reservoir between the two walls
ISA.22.11	For the waters of the old pool.
ISA.22.11	But you did not depend on Him who made it,
ISA.22.11	Nor did you take into consideration Him who planned it long ago.
ISA.22.12	Therefore in that day the Lord G
ISA.22.12	To shaving the head and to wearing sackcloth.
ISA.22.13	Instead, there is gaiety and gladness,
ISA.22.13	Killing of cattle and slaughtering of sheep,
ISA.22.13	Eating of meat and drinking of wine:
ISA.22.13	“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we may die.”
ISA.22.14	But the L
ISA.22.14	“Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you
ISA.22.14	Until you die,” says the Lord G
ISA.22.15	Thus says the Lord G
ISA.22.15	“Come, go to this steward,
ISA.22.15	To Shebna, who is in charge of the 
ISA.22.16	‘What right do you have here,
ISA.22.16	And whom do you have here,
ISA.22.16	That you have hewn a tomb for yourself here,
ISA.22.16	You who hew a tomb on the height,
ISA.22.16	You who carve a resting place for yourself in the rock?
ISA.22.17	Behold, the L
ISA.22.17	And He is about to grasp you firmly
ISA.22.18	There you will die
ISA.22.18	And there your splendid chariots will be,
ISA.22.18	You shame of your master’s house.’
ISA.22.19	I will depose you from your office,
ISA.22.19	And I will pull you down from your station.
ISA.22.20	Then it will come about in that day,
ISA.22.20	That I will summon My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
ISA.22.21	And I will clothe him with your tunic
ISA.22.21	And tie your sash securely about him.
ISA.22.21	I will entrust him with your authority,
ISA.22.21	And he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
ISA.22.22	Then I will set the key of the house of David on his shoulder,
ISA.22.22	When he opens no one will shut,
ISA.22.22	When he shuts no one will open.
ISA.22.23	I will drive him 
ISA.22.23	And he will become a throne of glory to his father’s house.
ISA.22.24	So they will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, offspring and issue, all the least of vessels, from bowls to all the jars. 
ISA.22.25	In that day,” declares the L
ISA.23.1	The oracle concerning Tyre.
ISA.23.1	Wail, O ships of Tarshish,
ISA.23.1	For 
ISA.23.1	It is reported to them from the land of Cyprus.
ISA.23.2	Be silent, you inhabitants of the coastland,
ISA.23.2	You merchants of Sidon;
ISA.23.2	Your messengers crossed the sea
ISA.23.3	And 
ISA.23.3	The grain of the Nile, the harvest of the River was her revenue;
ISA.23.3	And she was the market of nations.
ISA.23.4	Be ashamed, O Sidon;
ISA.23.4	For the sea speaks, the stronghold of the sea, saying,
ISA.23.4	“I have neither travailed nor given birth,
ISA.23.4	I have neither brought up young men 
ISA.23.5	When the report 
ISA.23.5	They will be in anguish at the report of Tyre.
ISA.23.6	Pass over to Tarshish;
ISA.23.6	Wail, O inhabitants of the coastland.
ISA.23.7	Is this your jubilant 
ISA.23.7	Whose origin is from antiquity,
ISA.23.7	Whose feet used to carry her to colonize distant places?
ISA.23.8	Who has planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns,
ISA.23.8	Whose merchants were princes, whose traders were the honored of the earth?
ISA.23.9	The L
ISA.23.9	To despise all the honored of the earth.
ISA.23.10	Overflow your land like the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish,
ISA.23.10	There is no more restraint.
ISA.23.11	He has stretched His hand out over the sea,
ISA.23.11	He has made the kingdoms tremble;
ISA.23.11	The L
ISA.23.12	He has said, “You shall exult no more, O crushed virgin daughter of Sidon.
ISA.23.12	Arise, pass over to Cyprus; even there you will find no rest.”
ISA.23.13	Behold, the land of the Chaldeans—this is the people 
ISA.23.14	Wail, O ships of Tarshish,
ISA.23.14	For your stronghold is destroyed.
ISA.23.15	Now in that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years like the days of one king. At the end of seventy years it will happen to Tyre as 
ISA.23.16	Take 
ISA.23.16	O forgotten harlot;
ISA.23.16	Pluck the strings skillfully, sing many songs,
ISA.23.16	That you may be remembered.
ISA.23.17	It will come about at the end of seventy years that the L
ISA.23.18	Her gain and her harlot’s wages will be set apart to the L
ISA.24.1	Behold, the L
ISA.24.2	And the people will be like the priest, the servant like his master, the maid like her mistress, the buyer like the seller, the lender like the borrower, the creditor like the debtor. 
ISA.24.3	The earth will be completely laid waste and completely despoiled, for the L
ISA.24.4	The earth mourns 
ISA.24.5	The earth is also polluted by its inhabitants, for they transgressed laws, violated statutes, broke the everlasting covenant. 
ISA.24.6	Therefore, a curse devours the earth, and those who live in it are held guilty. Therefore, the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men are left.
ISA.24.7	The new wine mourns,
ISA.24.7	The vine decays,
ISA.24.7	All the merry-hearted sigh.
ISA.24.8	The gaiety of tambourines ceases,
ISA.24.8	The noise of revelers stops,
ISA.24.8	The gaiety of the harp ceases.
ISA.24.9	They do not drink wine with song;
ISA.24.9	Strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.
ISA.24.10	The city of chaos is broken down;
ISA.24.10	Every house is shut up so that none may enter.
ISA.24.11	There is an outcry in the streets concerning the wine;
ISA.24.11	All joy turns to gloom.
ISA.24.11	The gaiety of the earth is banished.
ISA.24.12	Desolation is left in the city
ISA.24.12	And the gate is battered to ruins.
ISA.24.13	For thus it will be in the midst of the earth among the peoples,
ISA.24.13	As the shaking of an olive tree,
ISA.24.13	As the gleanings when the grape harvest is over.
ISA.24.14	They raise their voices, they shout for joy;
ISA.24.14	They cry out from the west concerning the majesty of the L
ISA.24.15	Therefore glorify the L
ISA.24.15	The name of the L
ISA.24.15	In the coastlands of the sea.
ISA.24.16	From the ends of the earth we hear songs, “Glory to the Righteous One,”
ISA.24.16	But I say, “Woe to me! Woe to me! Alas for me!
ISA.24.16	The treacherous deal treacherously,
ISA.24.16	And the treacherous deal very treacherously.”
ISA.24.17	Terror and pit and snare
ISA.24.17	Confront you, O inhabitant of the earth.
ISA.24.18	Then it will be that he who flees the report of disaster will fall into the pit,
ISA.24.18	And he who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the snare;
ISA.24.18	For the windows above are opened, and the foundations of the earth shake.
ISA.24.19	The earth is broken asunder,
ISA.24.19	The earth is split through,
ISA.24.19	The earth is shaken violently.
ISA.24.20	The earth reels to and fro like a drunkard
ISA.24.20	And it totters like a shack,
ISA.24.20	For its transgression is heavy upon it,
ISA.24.20	And it will fall, never to rise again.
ISA.24.21	So it will happen in that day,
ISA.24.21	That the L
ISA.24.21	And the kings of the earth on earth.
ISA.24.22	They will be gathered together
ISA.24.22	And will be confined in prison;
ISA.24.22	And after many days they 
ISA.24.23	Then the moon will be abashed and the sun ashamed,
ISA.24.23	For the L
ISA.24.23	And 
ISA.25.1	O L
ISA.25.1	I will exalt You, I will give thanks to Your name;
ISA.25.1	For You have worked wonders,
ISA.25.1	Plans 
ISA.25.2	For You have made a city into a heap,
ISA.25.2	A fortified city into a ruin;
ISA.25.2	A palace of strangers is a city no more,
ISA.25.2	It will never be rebuilt.
ISA.25.3	Therefore a strong people will glorify You;
ISA.25.3	Cities of ruthless nations will revere You.
ISA.25.4	For You have been a defense for the helpless,
ISA.25.4	A defense for the needy in his distress,
ISA.25.4	A refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat;
ISA.25.4	For the breath of the ruthless
ISA.25.4	Is like a 
ISA.25.5	Like heat in drought, You subdue the uproar of aliens;
ISA.25.6	The L
ISA.25.6	A banquet of aged wine, choice pieces with marrow,
ISA.25.7	And on this mountain He will swallow up the covering which is over all peoples,
ISA.25.7	Even the veil which is stretched over all nations.
ISA.25.8	He will swallow up death for all time,
ISA.25.8	And the Lord G
ISA.25.8	And He will remove the reproach of His people from all the earth;
ISA.25.8	For the L
ISA.25.9	And it will be said in that day,
ISA.25.9	“Behold, this is our God for whom we have waited that He might save us.
ISA.25.9	This is the L
ISA.25.9	Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.”
ISA.25.10	For the hand of the L
ISA.25.10	And Moab will be trodden down in his place
ISA.25.10	As straw is trodden down in the water of a manure pile.
ISA.25.11	And he will spread out his hands in the middle of it
ISA.25.11	As a swimmer spreads out 
ISA.25.11	But 
ISA.25.12	The unassailable fortifications of your walls He will bring down,
ISA.25.12	Lay low 
ISA.26.1	In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
ISA.26.1	“We have a strong city;
ISA.26.1	He sets up walls and ramparts for security.
ISA.26.2	Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter,
ISA.26.2	The one that remains faithful.
ISA.26.3	The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace,
ISA.26.3	Because he trusts in You.
ISA.26.4	Trust in the L
ISA.26.4	For in G
ISA.26.5	For He has brought low those who dwell on high, the unassailable city;
ISA.26.5	He lays it low, He lays it low to the ground, He casts it to the dust.
ISA.26.6	The foot will trample it,
ISA.26.6	The feet of the afflicted, the steps of the helpless.”
ISA.26.7	The way of the righteous is smooth;
ISA.26.7	O Upright One, make the path of the righteous level.
ISA.26.8	Indeed, 
ISA.26.8	We have waited for You eagerly;
ISA.26.8	Your name, even Your memory, is the desire of 
ISA.26.9	At night my soul longs for You,
ISA.26.9	Indeed, my spirit within me seeks You diligently;
ISA.26.9	For when the earth experiences Your judgments
ISA.26.9	The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
ISA.26.10	He does not learn righteousness;
ISA.26.10	He deals unjustly in the land of uprightness,
ISA.26.10	And does not perceive the majesty of the L
ISA.26.11	O L
ISA.26.11	They see 
ISA.26.11	Indeed, fire will devour Your enemies.
ISA.26.12	L
ISA.26.12	Since You have also performed for us all our works.
ISA.26.13	O L
ISA.26.14	The dead will not live, the departed spirits will not rise;
ISA.26.14	Therefore You have punished and destroyed them,
ISA.26.14	And You have wiped out all remembrance of them.
ISA.26.15	You have increased the nation, O L
ISA.26.15	You have increased the nation, You are glorified;
ISA.26.15	You have extended all the borders of the land.
ISA.26.16	O L
ISA.26.16	They could only whisper a prayer,
ISA.26.16	Your chastening was upon them.
ISA.26.17	As the pregnant woman approaches 
ISA.26.17	She writhes 
ISA.26.17	Thus were we before You, O L
ISA.26.18	We were pregnant, we writhed 
ISA.26.18	We gave birth, as it seems, 
ISA.26.18	We could not accomplish deliverance for the earth,
ISA.26.18	Nor were inhabitants of the world born.
ISA.26.19	Your dead will live;
ISA.26.19	Their corpses will rise.
ISA.26.19	You who lie in the dust, awake and shout for joy,
ISA.26.19	For your dew 
ISA.26.19	And the earth will give birth to the departed spirits.
ISA.26.20	Come, my people, enter into your rooms
ISA.26.20	And close your doors behind you;
ISA.26.20	Hide for a little while
ISA.26.20	Until indignation runs 
ISA.26.21	For behold, the L
ISA.26.21	To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity;
ISA.26.21	And the earth will reveal her bloodshed
ISA.26.21	And will no longer cover her slain.
ISA.27.1	In that day the L
ISA.27.1	With His fierce and great and mighty sword,
ISA.27.1	Even Leviathan the twisted serpent;
ISA.27.1	And He will kill the dragon who 
ISA.27.2	In that day,
ISA.27.2	“A vineyard of wine, sing of it!
ISA.27.3	I, the L
ISA.27.3	I water it every moment.
ISA.27.3	So that no one will damage it,
ISA.27.3	I guard it night and day.
ISA.27.4	I have no wrath.
ISA.27.4	Should someone give Me briars 
ISA.27.5	Or let him rely on My protection,
ISA.27.5	Let him make peace with Me,
ISA.27.5	Let him make peace with Me.”
ISA.27.6	In the days to come Jacob will take root,
ISA.27.6	Israel will blossom and sprout,
ISA.27.6	And they will fill the whole world with fruit.
ISA.27.7	Like the striking of Him who has struck them, has He struck them?
ISA.27.7	Or like the slaughter of His slain, have they been slain?
ISA.27.8	You contended with them by banishing them, by driving them away.
ISA.27.8	With His fierce wind He has expelled 
ISA.27.9	Therefore through this Jacob’s iniquity will be forgiven;
ISA.27.9	And this will be the full price of the pardoning of his sin:
ISA.27.9	When he makes all the altar stones like pulverized chalk stones;
ISA.27.10	For the fortified city is isolated,
ISA.27.10	A homestead forlorn and forsaken like the desert;
ISA.27.10	There the calf will graze,
ISA.27.10	And there it will lie down and feed on its branches.
ISA.27.11	When its limbs are dry, they are broken off;
ISA.27.11	Women come 
ISA.27.11	For they are not a people of discernment,
ISA.27.11	Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them.
ISA.27.11	And their Creator will not be gracious to them.
ISA.27.12	In that day the L
ISA.27.13	It will come about also in that day that a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were perishing in the land of Assyria and who were scattered in the land of Egypt will come and worship the L
ISA.28.1	Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim,
ISA.28.1	And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty,
ISA.28.1	Which is at the head of the fertile valley
ISA.28.1	Of those who are overcome with wine!
ISA.28.2	Behold, the Lord has a strong and mighty 
ISA.28.2	As a storm of hail, a tempest of destruction,
ISA.28.2	Like a storm of mighty overflowing waters,
ISA.28.2	He has cast 
ISA.28.3	The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim is trodden under foot.
ISA.28.4	And the fading flower of its glorious beauty,
ISA.28.4	Which is at the head of the fertile valley,
ISA.28.4	Will be like the first-ripe fig prior to summer,
ISA.28.4	Which one sees,
ISA.28.4	He swallows it.
ISA.28.5	In that day the L
ISA.28.5	And a glorious diadem to the remnant of His people;
ISA.28.6	A spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment,
ISA.28.6	A strength to those who repel the onslaught at the gate.
ISA.28.7	And these also reel with wine and stagger from strong drink:
ISA.28.7	The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink,
ISA.28.7	They are confused by wine, they stagger from strong drink;
ISA.28.7	They reel while having visions,
ISA.28.7	They totter 
ISA.28.8	For all the tables are full of filthy vomit, without a 
ISA.28.9	“To whom would He teach knowledge,
ISA.28.9	And to whom would He interpret the message?
ISA.28.9	Those 
ISA.28.9	Those 
ISA.28.10	For 
ISA.28.10	‘Order on order, order on order,
ISA.28.10	Line on line, line on line,
ISA.28.10	A little here, a little there.’ ”
ISA.28.11	Indeed, He will speak to this people
ISA.28.11	Through stammering lips and a foreign tongue,
ISA.28.12	He who said to them, “Here is rest, give rest to the weary,”
ISA.28.12	And, “Here is repose,” but they would not listen.
ISA.28.13	So the word of the L
ISA.28.13	“Order on order, order on order,
ISA.28.13	Line on line, line on line,
ISA.28.13	A little here, a little there,”
ISA.28.13	That they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared and taken captive.
ISA.28.14	Therefore, hear the word of the L
ISA.28.14	Who rule this people who are in Jerusalem,
ISA.28.15	Because you have said, “We have made a covenant with death,
ISA.28.15	And with Sheol we have made a pact.
ISA.28.15	The overwhelming scourge will not reach us when it passes by,
ISA.28.15	For we have made falsehood our refuge and we have concealed ourselves with deception.”
ISA.28.16	Therefore thus says the Lord G
ISA.28.16	“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a tested stone,
ISA.28.16	A costly cornerstone 
ISA.28.16	He who believes 
ISA.28.17	I will make justice the measuring line
ISA.28.17	And righteousness the level;
ISA.28.17	Then hail will sweep away the refuge of lies
ISA.28.17	And the waters will overflow the secret place.
ISA.28.18	Your covenant with death will be canceled,
ISA.28.18	And your pact with Sheol will not stand;
ISA.28.18	When the overwhelming scourge passes through,
ISA.28.18	Then you become its trampling 
ISA.28.19	As often as it passes through, it will seize you;
ISA.28.19	For morning after morning it will pass through, 
ISA.28.19	And it will be sheer terror to understand what it means.”
ISA.28.20	The bed is too short on which to stretch out,
ISA.28.20	And the blanket is too small to wrap oneself in.
ISA.28.21	For the L
ISA.28.21	He will be stirred up as in the valley of Gibeon,
ISA.28.21	To do His task, His unusual task,
ISA.28.21	And to work His work, His extraordinary work.
ISA.28.22	And now do not carry on as scoffers,
ISA.28.22	Or your fetters will be made stronger;
ISA.28.22	For I have heard from the Lord G
ISA.28.22	Of decisive destruction on all the earth.
ISA.28.23	Give ear and hear my voice,
ISA.28.23	Listen and hear my words.
ISA.28.24	Does the farmer plow continually to plant seed?
ISA.28.24	Does he 
ISA.28.25	Does he not level its surface
ISA.28.25	And sow dill and scatter cummin
ISA.28.25	And plant wheat in rows,
ISA.28.25	Barley in its place and rye within its area?
ISA.28.26	For his God instructs and teaches him properly.
ISA.28.27	For dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge,
ISA.28.27	Nor is the cartwheel driven over cummin;
ISA.28.27	But dill is beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a club.
ISA.28.28	Indeed, he does not continue to thresh it forever.
ISA.28.28	Because the wheel of 
ISA.28.28	He does not thresh it longer.
ISA.28.29	This also comes from the L
ISA.29.1	Woe, O Ariel, Ariel the city 
ISA.29.1	Add year to year, observe 
ISA.29.2	I will bring distress to Ariel,
ISA.29.2	And she will be 
ISA.29.2	And she will be like an Ariel to me.
ISA.29.3	I will camp against you encircling 
ISA.29.3	And I will set siegeworks against you,
ISA.29.3	And I will raise up battle towers against you.
ISA.29.4	Then you will be brought low;
ISA.29.4	From the earth you will speak,
ISA.29.4	And from the dust 
ISA.29.4	Your words 
ISA.29.4	Your voice will also be like that of a spirit from the ground,
ISA.29.4	And your speech will whisper from the dust.
ISA.29.5	But the multitude of your enemies will become like fine dust,
ISA.29.5	And the multitude of the ruthless ones like the chaff which blows away;
ISA.29.5	And it will happen instantly, suddenly.
ISA.29.6	From the L
ISA.29.7	And the multitude of all the nations who wage war against Ariel,
ISA.29.7	Even all who wage war against her and her stronghold, and who distress her,
ISA.29.7	Will be like a dream, a vision of the night.
ISA.29.8	It will be as when a hungry man dreams—
ISA.29.8	And behold, he is eating;
ISA.29.8	But when he awakens, his hunger is not satisfied,
ISA.29.8	Or as when a thirsty man dreams—
ISA.29.8	And behold, he is drinking,
ISA.29.8	But when he awakens, behold, he is faint
ISA.29.8	And his thirst is not quenched.
ISA.29.8	Thus the multitude of all the nations will be
ISA.29.8	Who wage war against Mount Zion.
ISA.29.9	Be delayed and wait,
ISA.29.9	Blind yourselves and be blind;
ISA.29.9	They become drunk, but not with wine,
ISA.29.9	They stagger, but not with strong drink.
ISA.29.10	For the L
ISA.29.10	He has shut your eyes, the prophets;
ISA.29.10	And He has covered your heads, the seers.
ISA.29.11	The entire vision will be to you like the words of a sealed book, which when they give it to the one who is literate, saying, “Please read this,” he will say, “I cannot, for it is sealed.” 
ISA.29.12	Then the book will be given to the one who is illiterate, saying, “Please read this.” And he will say, “I cannot read.”
ISA.29.13	Then the Lord said,
ISA.29.13	“Because this people draw near with their words
ISA.29.13	And honor Me with their lip service,
ISA.29.13	But they remove their hearts far from Me,
ISA.29.13	And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned 
ISA.29.14	Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous;
ISA.29.14	And the wisdom of their wise men will perish,
ISA.29.14	And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed.”
ISA.29.15	Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the L
ISA.29.15	And whose deeds are 
ISA.29.15	And they say, “Who sees us?” or “Who knows us?”
ISA.29.16	You turn 
ISA.29.16	Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay,
ISA.29.16	That what is made would say to its maker, “He did not make me”;
ISA.29.16	Or what is formed say to him who formed it, “He has no understanding”?
ISA.29.17	Is it not yet just a little while
ISA.29.17	Before Lebanon will be turned into a fertile field,
ISA.29.17	And the fertile field will be considered as a forest?
ISA.29.18	On that day the deaf will hear words of a book,
ISA.29.18	And out of 
ISA.29.19	The afflicted also will increase their gladness in the L
ISA.29.19	And the needy of mankind will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.29.20	For the ruthless will come to an end and the scorner will be finished,
ISA.29.20	Indeed all who are intent on doing evil will be cut off;
ISA.29.21	Who cause a person to be indicted by a word,
ISA.29.21	And ensnare him who adjudicates at the gate,
ISA.29.21	And defraud the one in the right with meaningless arguments.
ISA.29.22	Therefore thus says the L
ISA.29.22	“Jacob shall not now be ashamed, nor shall his face now turn pale;
ISA.29.23	But when he sees his children, the work of My hands, in his midst,
ISA.29.23	They will sanctify My name;
ISA.29.23	Indeed, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob
ISA.29.23	And will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
ISA.29.24	Those who err in mind will know the truth,
ISA.29.24	And those who criticize will accept instruction.
ISA.30.1	“Woe to the rebellious children,” declares the L
ISA.30.1	“Who execute a plan, but not Mine,
ISA.30.1	And make an alliance, but not of My Spirit,
ISA.30.1	In order to add sin to sin;
ISA.30.2	Who proceed down to Egypt
ISA.30.2	Without consulting Me,
ISA.30.2	To take refuge in the safety of Pharaoh
ISA.30.2	And to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!
ISA.30.3	Therefore the safety of Pharaoh will be your shame
ISA.30.3	And the shelter in the shadow of Egypt, your humiliation.
ISA.30.4	For their princes are at Zoan
ISA.30.4	And their ambassadors arrive at Hanes.
ISA.30.5	Everyone will be ashamed because of a people who cannot profit them,
ISA.30.6	The oracle concerning the beasts of the Negev.
ISA.30.6	Through a land of distress and anguish,
ISA.30.6	From where 
ISA.30.6	They carry their riches on the backs of young donkeys
ISA.30.6	And their treasures on camels’ humps,
ISA.30.6	To a people who cannot profit 
ISA.30.7	Even Egypt, whose help is vain and empty.
ISA.30.7	Therefore, I have called her
ISA.30.7	“Rahab who has been exterminated.”
ISA.30.8	Now go, write it on a tablet before them
ISA.30.8	And inscribe it on a scroll,
ISA.30.8	That it may serve in the time to come
ISA.30.8	As a witness forever.
ISA.30.9	For this is a rebellious people, false sons,
ISA.30.9	Sons who refuse to listen
ISA.30.9	To the instruction of the L
ISA.30.10	Who say to the seers, “You must not see 
ISA.30.10	And to the prophets, “You must not prophesy to us what is right,
ISA.30.10	Speak to us pleasant words,
ISA.30.10	Prophesy illusions.
ISA.30.11	Get out of the way, turn aside from the path,
ISA.30.11	Let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel.”
ISA.30.12	Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.30.12	“Since you have rejected this word
ISA.30.12	And have put your trust in oppression and guile, and have relied on them,
ISA.30.13	Therefore this iniquity will be to you
ISA.30.13	Like a breach about to fall,
ISA.30.13	A bulge in a high wall,
ISA.30.13	Whose collapse comes suddenly in an instant,
ISA.30.14	Whose collapse is like the smashing of a potter’s jar,
ISA.30.14	So ruthlessly shattered
ISA.30.14	That a sherd will not be found among its pieces
ISA.30.14	To take fire from a hearth
ISA.30.14	Or to scoop water from a cistern.”
ISA.30.15	For thus the Lord G
ISA.30.15	“In repentance and rest you will be saved,
ISA.30.15	In quietness and trust is your strength.”
ISA.30.15	But you were not willing,
ISA.30.16	And you said, “No, for we will flee on horses,”
ISA.30.16	Therefore you shall flee!
ISA.30.16	“And we will ride on swift 
ISA.30.16	Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift.
ISA.30.17	One thousand 
ISA.30.17	You will flee at the threat of five,
ISA.30.17	Until you are left as a flag on a mountain top
ISA.30.17	And as a signal on a hill.
ISA.30.18	Therefore the L
ISA.30.18	And therefore He waits on high to have compassion on you.
ISA.30.18	For the L
ISA.30.18	How blessed are all those who long for Him.
ISA.30.19	O people in Zion, inhabitant in Jerusalem, you will weep no longer. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when He hears it, He will answer you. 
ISA.30.20	Although the Lord has given you bread of privation and water of oppression, 
ISA.30.21	Your ears will hear a word behind you, “This is the way, walk in it,” whenever you turn to the right or to the left. 
ISA.30.22	And you will defile your graven images overlaid with silver, and your molten images plated with gold. You will scatter them as an impure thing, 
ISA.30.23	Then He will give 
ISA.30.24	Also the oxen and the donkeys which work the ground will eat salted fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and fork. 
ISA.30.25	On every lofty mountain and on every high hill there will be streams running with water on the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. 
ISA.30.26	The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times 
ISA.30.27	Behold, the name of the L
ISA.30.27	Burning is His anger and dense is 
ISA.30.27	His lips are filled with indignation
ISA.30.27	And His tongue is like a consuming fire;
ISA.30.28	His breath is like an overflowing torrent,
ISA.30.28	Which reaches to the neck,
ISA.30.28	To shake the nations back and forth in a sieve,
ISA.30.28	And to 
ISA.30.29	You will have songs as in the night when you keep the festival,
ISA.30.29	And gladness of heart as when one marches to 
ISA.30.29	To go to the mountain of the L
ISA.30.30	And the L
ISA.30.30	And the descending of His arm to be seen in fierce anger,
ISA.30.30	And 
ISA.30.30	In cloudburst, downpour and hailstones.
ISA.30.31	For at the voice of the L
ISA.30.32	And every blow of the rod of punishment,
ISA.30.32	Which the L
ISA.30.32	Will be with 
ISA.30.32	And in battles, brandishing weapons, He will fight them.
ISA.30.33	For 
ISA.30.33	Indeed, it has been prepared for the king.
ISA.30.33	He has made it deep and large,
ISA.30.33	A pyre of fire with plenty of wood;
ISA.30.33	The breath of the L
ISA.31.1	Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help
ISA.31.1	And trust in chariots because they are many
ISA.31.1	And in horsemen because they are very strong,
ISA.31.1	But they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek the L
ISA.31.2	Yet He also is wise and will bring disaster
ISA.31.2	And does not retract His words,
ISA.31.2	But will arise against the house of evildoers
ISA.31.2	And against the help of the workers of iniquity.
ISA.31.3	Now the Egyptians are men and not God,
ISA.31.3	And their horses are flesh and not spirit;
ISA.31.3	So the L
ISA.31.3	And he who helps will stumble
ISA.31.3	And he who is helped will fall,
ISA.31.3	And all of them will come to an end together.
ISA.31.4	For thus says the L
ISA.31.4	“As the lion or the young lion growls over his prey,
ISA.31.4	Against which a band of shepherds is called out,
ISA.31.4	So will the L
ISA.31.5	Like flying birds so the L
ISA.31.5	He will protect and deliver 
ISA.31.5	He will pass over and rescue 
ISA.31.6	Return to Him from whom you have deeply defected, O sons of Israel. 
ISA.31.7	For in that day every man will cast away his silver idols and his gold idols, which your sinful hands have made for you as a sin.
ISA.31.8	And the Assyrian will fall by a sword not of man,
ISA.31.8	And a sword not of man will devour him.
ISA.31.8	So he will not escape the sword,
ISA.31.8	And his young men will become forced laborers.
ISA.31.9	“His rock will pass away because of panic,
ISA.31.9	And his princes will be terrified at the standard,”
ISA.31.9	Declares the L
ISA.32.1	Behold, a king will reign righteously
ISA.32.1	And princes will rule justly.
ISA.32.2	Each will be like a refuge from the wind
ISA.32.2	And a shelter from the storm,
ISA.32.2	Like streams of water in a dry country,
ISA.32.2	Like the shade of a huge rock in a parched land.
ISA.32.3	Then the eyes of those who see will not be blinded,
ISA.32.3	And the ears of those who hear will listen.
ISA.32.4	The mind of the hasty will discern the truth,
ISA.32.4	And the tongue of the stammerers will hasten to speak clearly.
ISA.32.5	No longer will the fool be called noble,
ISA.32.5	Or the rogue be spoken of 
ISA.32.6	For a fool speaks nonsense,
ISA.32.6	And his heart inclines toward wickedness:
ISA.32.6	To practice ungodliness and to speak error against the L
ISA.32.6	To keep the hungry person unsatisfied
ISA.32.6	And to withhold drink from the thirsty.
ISA.32.7	As for a rogue, his weapons are evil;
ISA.32.7	He devises wicked schemes
ISA.32.7	To destroy 
ISA.32.7	Even though 
ISA.32.8	But the noble man devises noble plans;
ISA.32.8	And by noble plans he stands.
ISA.32.9	Rise up, you women who are at ease,
ISA.32.9	Give ear to my word,
ISA.32.9	You complacent daughters.
ISA.32.10	Within a year and 
ISA.32.10	You will be troubled, O complacent 
ISA.32.10	For the vintage is ended,
ISA.32.11	Tremble, you 
ISA.32.11	Be troubled, you complacent 
ISA.32.11	Strip, undress and put 
ISA.32.12	Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine,
ISA.32.13	For the land of my people 
ISA.32.13	Yea, for all the joyful houses 
ISA.32.14	Because the palace has been abandoned, the populated city forsaken.
ISA.32.14	Hill and watch-tower have become caves forever,
ISA.32.14	A delight for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks;
ISA.32.15	Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high,
ISA.32.15	And the wilderness becomes a fertile field,
ISA.32.15	And the fertile field is considered as a forest.
ISA.32.16	Then justice will dwell in the wilderness
ISA.32.16	And righteousness will abide in the fertile field.
ISA.32.17	And the work of righteousness will be peace,
ISA.32.17	And the service of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.
ISA.32.18	Then my people will live in a peaceful habitation,
ISA.32.18	And in secure dwellings and in undisturbed resting places;
ISA.32.19	And it will hail when the forest comes down,
ISA.32.19	And the city will be utterly laid low.
ISA.32.20	How blessed will you be, you who sow beside all waters,
ISA.32.20	Who let out freely the ox and the donkey.
ISA.33.1	Woe to you, O destroyer,
ISA.33.1	While you were not destroyed;
ISA.33.1	And he who is treacherous, while 
ISA.33.1	As soon as you finish destroying, you will be destroyed;
ISA.33.1	As soon as you cease to deal treacherously, 
ISA.33.2	O L
ISA.33.2	Be their strength every morning,
ISA.33.2	Our salvation also in the time of distress.
ISA.33.3	At the sound of the tumult peoples flee;
ISA.33.3	At the lifting up of Yourself nations disperse.
ISA.33.4	Your spoil is gathered 
ISA.33.4	As locusts rushing about men rush about on it.
ISA.33.5	The L
ISA.33.5	He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
ISA.33.6	And He will be the stability of your times,
ISA.33.6	A wealth of salvation, wisdom and knowledge;
ISA.33.6	The fear of the L
ISA.33.7	Behold, their brave men cry in the streets,
ISA.33.7	The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.
ISA.33.8	The highways are desolate, the traveler has ceased,
ISA.33.8	He has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities,
ISA.33.8	He has no regard for man.
ISA.33.9	The land mourns 
ISA.33.9	Lebanon is shamed 
ISA.33.9	Sharon is like a desert plain,
ISA.33.9	And Bashan and Carmel lose 
ISA.33.10	“Now I will arise,” says the L
ISA.33.10	“Now I will be exalted, now I will be lifted up.
ISA.33.11	You have conceived chaff, you will give birth to stubble;
ISA.33.11	My breath will consume you like a fire.
ISA.33.12	The peoples will be burned to lime,
ISA.33.12	Like cut thorns which are burned in the fire.
ISA.33.13	“You who are far away, hear what I have done;
ISA.33.13	And you who are near, acknowledge My might.”
ISA.33.14	Sinners in Zion are terrified;
ISA.33.14	Trembling has seized the godless.
ISA.33.14	“Who among us can live with the consuming fire?
ISA.33.14	Who among us can live with continual burning?”
ISA.33.15	He who walks righteously and speaks with sincerity,
ISA.33.15	He who rejects unjust gain
ISA.33.15	And shakes his hands so that they hold no bribe;
ISA.33.15	He who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed
ISA.33.15	And shuts his eyes from looking upon evil;
ISA.33.16	He will dwell on the heights,
ISA.33.16	His refuge will be the impregnable rock;
ISA.33.16	His bread will be given 
ISA.33.16	His water will be sure.
ISA.33.17	Your eyes will see the King in His beauty;
ISA.33.17	They will behold a far-distant land.
ISA.33.18	Your heart will meditate on terror:
ISA.33.18	“Where is he who counts?
ISA.33.18	Where is he who weighs?
ISA.33.18	Where is he who counts the towers?”
ISA.33.19	You will no longer see a fierce people,
ISA.33.19	A people of unintelligible speech which no one comprehends,
ISA.33.19	Of a stammering tongue which no one understands.
ISA.33.20	Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts;
ISA.33.20	Your eyes will see Jerusalem, an undisturbed habitation,
ISA.33.20	A tent which will not be folded;
ISA.33.20	Its stakes will never be pulled up,
ISA.33.20	Nor any of its cords be torn apart.
ISA.33.21	But there the majestic 
ISA.33.21	A place of rivers 
ISA.33.21	On which no boat with oars will go,
ISA.33.21	And on which no mighty ship will pass—
ISA.33.22	For the L
ISA.33.22	The L
ISA.33.22	The L
ISA.33.22	He will save us—
ISA.33.23	Your tackle hangs slack;
ISA.33.23	It cannot hold the base of its mast firmly,
ISA.33.23	Nor spread out the sail.
ISA.33.23	Then the prey of an abundant spoil will be divided;
ISA.33.23	The lame will take the plunder.
ISA.33.24	And no resident will say, “I am sick”;
ISA.33.24	The people who dwell there will be forgiven 
ISA.34.1	Draw near, O nations, to hear; and listen, O peoples!
ISA.34.1	Let the earth and all it contains hear, and the world and all that springs from it.
ISA.34.2	For the L
ISA.34.2	And 
ISA.34.2	He has utterly destroyed them,
ISA.34.2	He has given them over to slaughter.
ISA.34.3	So their slain will be thrown out,
ISA.34.3	And their corpses will give off their stench,
ISA.34.3	And the mountains will be drenched with their blood.
ISA.34.4	And all the host of heaven will wear away,
ISA.34.4	And the sky will be rolled up like a scroll;
ISA.34.4	All their hosts will also wither away
ISA.34.4	As a leaf withers from the vine,
ISA.34.4	Or as 
ISA.34.5	For My sword is satiated in heaven,
ISA.34.5	Behold it shall descend for judgment upon Edom
ISA.34.5	And upon the people whom I have devoted to destruction.
ISA.34.6	The sword of the L
ISA.34.6	It is sated with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats,
ISA.34.6	With the fat of the kidneys of rams.
ISA.34.6	For the L
ISA.34.6	And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
ISA.34.7	Wild oxen will also fall with them
ISA.34.7	And young bulls with strong ones;
ISA.34.7	Thus their land will be soaked with blood,
ISA.34.7	And their dust become greasy with fat.
ISA.34.8	For the L
ISA.34.8	A year of recompense for the cause of Zion.
ISA.34.9	Its streams will be turned into pitch,
ISA.34.9	And its loose earth into brimstone,
ISA.34.9	And its land will become burning pitch.
ISA.34.10	It will not be quenched night or day;
ISA.34.10	Its smoke will go up forever.

ISA.34.12	And all its princes will be nothing.
ISA.34.13	Thorns will come up in its fortified towers,
ISA.34.13	Nettles and thistles in its fortified cities;
ISA.34.13	It will also be a haunt of jackals
ISA.34.14	The desert creatures will meet with the wolves,
ISA.34.14	The hairy goat also will cry to its kind;
ISA.34.14	Yes, the night monster will settle there

ISA.36.1	Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them. 
ISA.36.2	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a large army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway of the fuller’s field. 
ISA.36.3	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to him.
ISA.36.4	Then Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, “What is this confidence that you have? 
ISA.36.5	I say, ‘Your counsel and strength for the war are only empty words.’ Now on whom do you rely, that you have rebelled against me?

ISA.36.13	Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.

ISA.36.16	Do not listen to Hezekiah,’ for thus says the king of Assyria, ‘Make your peace with me and come out to me, and eat each of his vine and each of his fig tree and drink each of the waters of his own cistern,

ISA.36.22	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
ISA.37.1	And when King Hezekiah heard 
ISA.37.2	Then he sent Eliakim who was over the household with Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. 
ISA.37.3	They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day of distress, rebuke and rejection; for children have come to birth, and there is no strength to deliver.

ISA.37.5	So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
ISA.37.6	Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to your master, ‘Thus says the L

ISA.37.8	Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish. 
ISA.37.9	When he heard 
ISA.37.10	“Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” 
ISA.37.11	Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them completely. So will you be spared? 
ISA.37.12	Did the gods of those nations which my fathers have destroyed deliver them, 
ISA.37.13	Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, 
ISA.37.14	Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went up to the house of the L

ISA.37.20	Now, O L
ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent 
ISA.37.22	this is the word that the L

ISA.37.23	And against whom have you raised 
ISA.37.23	And haughtily lifted up your eyes?
ISA.37.23	Against the Holy One of Israel!
ISA.37.24	Through your servants you have reproached the Lord,
ISA.37.24	And you have said, ‘With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains,

ISA.37.26	Have you not heard?
ISA.37.26	Long ago I did it,
ISA.37.26	From ancient times I planned it.
ISA.37.26	Now I have brought it to pass,
ISA.37.26	That you should turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
ISA.37.27	Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength,
ISA.37.27	They were dismayed and put to shame;
ISA.37.27	They were

ISA.37.29	Because of your raging against Me
ISA.37.29	And because your arrogance has come up to My ears,
ISA.37.29	Therefore I will put My hook in your nose
ISA.37.29	And My bridle in your lips,
ISA.37.29	And I will turn you back by the way which you came.
ISA.37.30	“Then this shall be the sign for you: you will eat this year what grows of itself, in the second year what springs from the same, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 
ISA.37.31	The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.

ISA.37.36	Then the angel of the L

ISA.38.1	In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, “Thus says the L

ISA.39.4	He said, “What have they seen in your house?” So Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasuries that I have not shown them.”

ISA.41.26	Surely there was no one who heard your words.
ISA.41.27	“Formerly 
ISA.41.27	And to Jerusalem, ‘I will give a messenger of good news.’
ISA.41.28	But when I look, there is no one,
ISA.41.28	And there is no counselor among them
ISA.41.28	Who, if I ask, can give an answer.
ISA.41.29	Behold, all of them are 
ISA.41.29	Their works are worthless,
ISA.41.29	Their molten images are wind and emptiness.
ISA.42.1	“Behold, My Servant, whom I uphold;
ISA.42.1	My chosen one 
ISA.42.1	I have put My Spirit upon Him;
ISA.42.1	He will bring forth justice to the nations.
ISA.42.2	He will not cry out or raise 
ISA.42.2	Nor make His voice heard in the street.
ISA.42.3	A bruised reed He will not break
ISA.42.3	And a dimly burning wick He will not extinguish;
ISA.42.3	He will faithfully bring forth justice.
ISA.42.4	He will not be disheartened or crushed
ISA.42.4	Until He has established justice in the earth;
ISA.42.4	And the coastlands will wait expectantly for His law.”
ISA.42.5	Thus says God the L
ISA.42.5	Who created the heavens and stretched them out,
ISA.42.5	Who spread out the earth and its offspring,
ISA.42.5	Who gives breath to the people on it
ISA.42.5	And spirit to those who walk in it,
ISA.42.6	“I am the L
ISA.42.6	I will also hold You by the hand and watch over You,
ISA.42.6	And I will appoint You as a covenant to the people,
ISA.42.6	As a light to the nations,
ISA.42.7	To open blind eyes,
ISA.42.7	To bring out prisoners from the dungeon
ISA.42.7	And those who dwell in darkness from the prison.
ISA.42.8	I am the L
ISA.42.8	I will not give My glory to another,
ISA.42.8	Nor My praise to graven images.
ISA.42.9	Behold, the former things have come to pass,
ISA.42.9	Now I declare new things;
ISA.42.9	Before they spring forth I proclaim 
ISA.42.10	Sing to the L
ISA.42.10	You who go down to the sea, and all that is in it.
ISA.42.10	You islands, and those who dwell on them.
ISA.42.11	Let the wilderness and its cities lift up 
ISA.42.11	The settlements where Kedar inhabits.
ISA.42.11	Let the inhabitants of Sela sing aloud,
ISA.42.11	Let them shout for joy from the tops of the mountains.
ISA.42.12	Let them give glory to the L
ISA.42.12	And declare His praise in the coastlands.
ISA.42.13	The L
ISA.42.13	He will arouse 
ISA.42.13	He will utter a shout, yes, He will raise a war cry.
ISA.42.13	He will prevail against His enemies.
ISA.42.14	“I have kept silent for a long time,
ISA.42.14	I have kept still and restrained Myself.
ISA.42.14	I will both gasp and pant.
ISA.42.15	I will lay waste the mountains and hills
ISA.42.15	And wither all their vegetation;
ISA.42.15	I will make the rivers into coastlands
ISA.42.15	And dry up the ponds.
ISA.42.16	I will lead the blind by a way they do not know,
ISA.42.16	In paths they do not know I will guide them.
ISA.42.16	I will make darkness into light before them
ISA.42.16	And rugged places into plains.
ISA.42.16	These are the things I will do,
ISA.42.16	And I will not leave them undone.”
ISA.42.17	They will be turned back 
ISA.42.17	Who trust in idols,
ISA.42.17	Who say to molten images,
ISA.42.17	“You are our gods.”
ISA.42.18	Hear, you deaf!
ISA.42.18	And look, you blind, that you may see.
ISA.42.19	Who is blind but My servant,
ISA.42.19	Or so deaf as My messenger whom I send?
ISA.42.19	Who is so blind as he that is at peace 
ISA.42.19	Or so blind as the servant of the L
ISA.42.20	You have seen many things, but you do not observe 
ISA.42.21	The L
ISA.42.21	To make the law great and glorious.
ISA.42.22	But this is a people plundered and despoiled;
ISA.42.22	All of them are trapped in caves,
ISA.42.22	Or are hidden away in prisons;
ISA.42.22	They have become a prey with none to deliver 
ISA.42.22	And a spoil, with none to say, “Give 
ISA.42.23	Who among you will give ear to this?
ISA.42.23	Who will give heed and listen hereafter?
ISA.42.24	Who gave Jacob up for spoil, and Israel to plunderers?
ISA.42.24	Was it not the L
ISA.42.24	And in whose ways they were not willing to walk,
ISA.42.24	And whose law they did not obey?
ISA.42.25	So He poured out on him the heat of His anger
ISA.42.25	And the fierceness of battle;
ISA.42.25	And it set him aflame all around,
ISA.42.25	Yet he did not recognize 
ISA.42.25	And it burned him, but he paid no attention.
ISA.43.1	But now, thus says the L
ISA.43.1	And He who formed you, O Israel,
ISA.43.1	“Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;
ISA.43.1	I have called you by name; you are Mine!
ISA.43.2	When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;
ISA.43.2	And through the rivers, they will not overflow you.
ISA.43.2	When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched,
ISA.43.2	Nor will the flame burn you.
ISA.43.3	For I am the L
ISA.43.3	The Holy One of Israel, your Savior;
ISA.43.3	I have given Egypt as your ransom,
ISA.43.3	Cush and Seba in your place.
ISA.43.4	Since you are precious in My sight,
ISA.43.4	I will give 
ISA.43.5	Do not fear, for I am with you;
ISA.43.5	I will bring your offspring from the east,
ISA.43.5	And gather you from the west.
ISA.43.6	I will say to the north, ‘Give 
ISA.43.6	And to the south, ‘Do not hold 
ISA.43.6	Bring My sons from afar
ISA.43.6	And My daughters from the ends of the earth,
ISA.43.7	Everyone who is called by My name,
ISA.43.7	And whom I have created for My glory,
ISA.43.7	Whom I have formed, even whom I have made.”
ISA.43.8	Bring out the people who are blind, even though they have eyes,
ISA.43.8	And the deaf, even though they have ears.
ISA.43.9	All the nations have gathered together
ISA.43.9	So that the peoples may be assembled.
ISA.43.9	Who among them can declare this
ISA.43.9	And proclaim to us the former things?
ISA.43.9	Let them present their witnesses that they may be justified,
ISA.43.9	Or let them hear and say, “It is true.”
ISA.43.10	“You are My witnesses,” declares the L
ISA.43.10	“And My servant whom I have chosen,
ISA.43.10	So that you may know and believe Me
ISA.43.10	And understand that I am He.
ISA.43.10	Before Me there was no God formed,
ISA.43.10	And there will be none after Me.
ISA.43.11	I, even I, am the L
ISA.43.11	And there is no savior besides Me.
ISA.43.12	It is I who have declared and saved and proclaimed,
ISA.43.12	And there was no strange 
ISA.43.12	So you are My witnesses,” declares the L
ISA.43.12	“And I am God.
ISA.43.13	Even from eternity I am He,
ISA.43.13	And there is none who can deliver out of My hand;
ISA.43.13	I act and who can reverse it?”
ISA.43.14	Thus says the L
ISA.43.14	“For your sake I have sent to Babylon,
ISA.43.14	And will bring them all down as fugitives,
ISA.43.14	Even the Chaldeans, into the ships 
ISA.43.15	I am the L
ISA.43.15	The Creator of Israel, your King.”
ISA.43.16	Thus says the L
ISA.43.16	Who makes a way through the sea
ISA.43.16	And a path through the mighty waters,
ISA.43.17	Who brings forth the chariot and the horse,
ISA.43.17	The army and the mighty man
ISA.43.17	(They will lie down together 
ISA.43.17	They have been quenched 
ISA.43.18	“Do not call to mind the former things,
ISA.43.18	Or ponder things of the past.
ISA.43.19	Behold, I will do something new,
ISA.43.19	Now it will spring forth;
ISA.43.19	Will you not be aware of it?
ISA.43.19	I will even make a roadway in the wilderness,
ISA.43.19	Rivers in the desert.
ISA.43.20	The beasts of the field will glorify Me,
ISA.43.20	The jackals and the ostriches,
ISA.43.20	Because I have given waters in the wilderness
ISA.43.20	And rivers in the desert,
ISA.43.20	To give drink to My chosen people.
ISA.43.21	The people whom I formed for Myself
ISA.43.21	Will declare My praise.
ISA.43.22	“Yet you have not called on Me, O Jacob;
ISA.43.22	But you have become weary of Me, O Israel.
ISA.43.23	You have not brought to Me the sheep of your burnt offerings,
ISA.43.23	Nor have you honored Me with your sacrifices.
ISA.43.23	I have not burdened you with offerings,
ISA.43.23	Nor wearied you with incense.
ISA.43.24	You have bought Me not sweet cane with money,
ISA.43.24	Nor have you filled Me with the fat of your sacrifices;
ISA.43.24	Rather you have burdened Me with your sins,
ISA.43.24	You have wearied Me with your iniquities.
ISA.43.25	“I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions for My own sake,
ISA.43.25	And I will not remember your sins.
ISA.43.26	Put Me in remembrance, let us argue our case together;
ISA.43.26	State your 
ISA.43.27	Your first forefather sinned,
ISA.43.27	And your spokesmen have transgressed against Me.
ISA.43.28	So I will pollute the princes of the sanctuary,
ISA.43.28	And I will consign Jacob to the ban and Israel to revilement.
ISA.44.1	“But now listen, O Jacob, My servant,
ISA.44.1	And Israel, whom I have chosen:
ISA.44.2	Thus says the L
ISA.44.2	And formed you from the womb, who will help you,
ISA.44.2	‘Do not fear, O Jacob My servant;
ISA.44.2	And you Jeshurun whom I have chosen.
ISA.44.3	For I will pour out water on the thirsty 
ISA.44.3	And streams on the dry ground;
ISA.44.3	I will pour out My Spirit on your offspring
ISA.44.3	And My blessing on your descendants;
ISA.44.4	And they will spring up among the grass
ISA.44.4	Like poplars by streams of water.’
ISA.44.5	This one will say, ‘I am the L
ISA.44.5	And that one will call on the name of Jacob;
ISA.44.5	And another will write 
ISA.44.5	And will name Israel’s name with honor.
ISA.44.6	“Thus says the L
ISA.44.6	‘I am the first and I am the last,
ISA.44.6	And there is no God besides Me.
ISA.44.7	Who is like Me? Let him proclaim and declare it;
ISA.44.7	Yes, let him recount it to Me in order,
ISA.44.7	From the time that I established the ancient nation.
ISA.44.7	And let them declare to them the things that are coming
ISA.44.7	And the events that are going to take place.
ISA.44.8	Do not tremble and do not be afraid;
ISA.44.8	Have I not long since announced 
ISA.44.8	And you are My witnesses.
ISA.44.8	Is there any God besides Me,
ISA.44.8	Or is there any 
ISA.44.8	I know of none.’ ”
ISA.44.9	Those who fashion a graven image are all of them futile, and their precious things are of no profit; even their own witnesses fail to see or know, so that they will be put to shame. 
ISA.44.10	Who has fashioned a god or cast an idol to no profit? 
ISA.44.11	Behold, all his companions will be put to shame, for the craftsmen themselves are mere men. Let them all assemble themselves, let them stand up, let them tremble, let them together be put to shame.
ISA.44.12	The man shapes iron into a cutting tool and does his work over the coals, fashioning it with hammers and working it with his strong arm. He also gets hungry and his strength fails; he drinks no water and becomes weary. 
ISA.44.13	 shapes wood, he extends a measuring line; he outlines it with red chalk. He works it with planes and outlines it with a compass, and makes it like the form of a man, like the beauty of man, so that it may sit in a house. 
ISA.44.14	Surely he cuts cedars for himself, and takes a cypress or an oak and raises 
ISA.44.15	Then it becomes 
ISA.44.16	Half of it he burns in the fire; over 
ISA.44.17	But the rest of it he makes into a god, his graven image. He falls down before it and worships; he also prays to it and says, “Deliver me, for you are my god.”
ISA.44.18	They do not know, nor do they understand, for He has smeared over their eyes so that they cannot see and their hearts so that they cannot comprehend. 
ISA.44.19	No one recalls, nor is there knowledge or understanding to say, “I have burned half of it in the fire and also have baked bread over its coals. I roast meat and eat 
ISA.44.20	He feeds on ashes; a deceived heart has turned him aside. And he cannot deliver himself, nor say, “Is there not a lie in my right hand?”
ISA.44.21	“Remember these things, O Jacob,
ISA.44.21	And Israel, for you are My servant;
ISA.44.21	I have formed you, you are My servant,
ISA.44.21	O Israel, you will not be forgotten by Me.
ISA.44.22	I have wiped out your transgressions like a thick cloud
ISA.44.22	And your sins like a heavy mist.
ISA.44.22	Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.”
ISA.44.23	Shout for joy, O heavens, for the L
ISA.44.23	Shout joyfully, you lower parts of the earth;
ISA.44.23	Break forth into a shout of joy, you mountains,
ISA.44.23	O forest, and every tree in it;
ISA.44.23	For the L
ISA.44.23	And in Israel He shows forth His glory.
ISA.44.24	Thus says the L
ISA.44.24	“I, the L
ISA.44.24	Stretching out the heavens by Myself
ISA.44.24	And spreading out the earth all alone,
ISA.44.25	Causing the omens of boasters to fail,
ISA.44.25	Making fools out of diviners,
ISA.44.25	Causing wise men to draw back
ISA.44.25	And turning their knowledge into foolishness,
ISA.44.26	Confirming the word of His servant
ISA.44.26	And performing the purpose of His messengers.
ISA.44.26	And of the cities of Judah, ‘They shall be built.’
ISA.44.26	And I will raise up her ruins 
ISA.44.27	And I will make your rivers dry.
ISA.44.28	And he will perform all My desire.’
ISA.44.28	And he declares of Jerusalem, ‘She will be built,’
ISA.44.28	And of the temple, ‘Your foundation will be laid.’ ”
ISA.45.1	Thus says the L
ISA.45.1	Whom I have taken by the right hand,
ISA.45.1	To subdue nations before him
ISA.45.1	And to loose the loins of kings;
ISA.45.1	To open doors before him so that gates will not be shut:
ISA.45.2	“I will go before you and make the rough places smooth;
ISA.45.2	I will shatter the doors of bronze and cut through their iron bars.
ISA.45.3	I will give you the treasures of darkness
ISA.45.3	And hidden wealth of secret places,
ISA.45.3	So that you may know that it is I,
ISA.45.3	The L
ISA.45.4	For the sake of Jacob My servant,
ISA.45.4	And Israel My chosen 
ISA.45.4	I have also called you by your name;
ISA.45.4	I have given you a title of honor
ISA.45.4	Though you have not known Me.
ISA.45.5	I am the L
ISA.45.5	Besides Me there is no God.
ISA.45.5	I will gird you, though you have not known Me;
ISA.45.6	That men may know from the rising to the setting of the sun
ISA.45.6	That there is no one besides Me.
ISA.45.6	I am the L
ISA.45.7	The One forming light and creating darkness,
ISA.45.7	Causing well-being and creating calamity;
ISA.45.7	I am the L
ISA.45.8	“Drip down, O heavens, from above,
ISA.45.8	And let the clouds pour down righteousness;
ISA.45.8	Let the earth open up and salvation bear fruit,
ISA.45.8	And righteousness spring up with it.
ISA.45.8	I, the L
ISA.45.9	“Woe to 
ISA.45.9	An earthenware vessel among the vessels of earth!
ISA.45.9	Will the clay say to the potter, ‘What are you doing?’
ISA.45.9	Or the thing you are making 
ISA.45.10	Woe to him who says to a father, ‘What are you begetting?’
ISA.45.10	Or to a woman, ‘To what are you giving birth?’ ”
ISA.45.11	Thus says the L
ISA.45.11	“Ask Me about the things to come concerning My sons,
ISA.45.11	And you shall commit to Me the work of My hands.
ISA.45.12	It is I who made the earth, and created man upon it.
ISA.45.12	I stretched out the heavens with My hands
ISA.45.12	And I ordained all their host.
ISA.45.13	I have aroused him in righteousness
ISA.45.13	And I will make all his ways smooth;
ISA.45.13	He will build My city and will let My exiles go free,
ISA.45.13	Without any payment or reward,” says the L
ISA.45.14	Thus says the L
ISA.45.14	“The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush
ISA.45.14	And the Sabeans, men of stature,

ISA.45.14	And will bow down to you;
ISA.45.14	They will make supplication to you:
ISA.45.14	‘Surely, God is with you, and there is none else,
ISA.45.14	No other God.’ ”
ISA.45.15	Truly, You are a God who hides Himself,
ISA.45.15	O God of Israel, Savior!
ISA.45.16	They will be put to shame and even humiliated, all of them;
ISA.45.16	The manufacturers of idols will go away together in humiliation.
ISA.45.17	Israel has been saved by the L
ISA.45.17	With an everlasting salvation;
ISA.45.17	You will not be put to shame or humiliated
ISA.45.17	To all eternity.
ISA.45.18	For thus says the L
ISA.45.18	“I am the L
ISA.45.19	I have not spoken in secret,
ISA.45.19	In some dark land;
ISA.45.19	I did not say to the offspring of Jacob,
ISA.45.19	‘Seek Me in a waste place’;
ISA.45.19	I, the L

ISA.45.20	“Gather yourselves and come;

ISA.45.21	Declare and set forth 
ISA.45.21	Indeed, let them consult together.
ISA.45.21	Who has announced this from of old?
ISA.45.21	Who has long since declared it?
ISA.45.21	Is it not I, the L
ISA.45.21	And there is no other God besides Me,
ISA.45.21	A righteous God and a Savior;
ISA.45.21	There is none except Me.
ISA.45.22	Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth;
ISA.45.22	For I am God, and there is no other.
ISA.45.23	I have sworn by Myself,
ISA.45.23	The word has gone forth from My mouth in righteousness
ISA.45.23	And will not turn back,
ISA.45.23	That to Me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear 
ISA.45.24	They will say of Me, ‘Only in the L

ISA.46.1	Bel has bowed down, Nebo stoops over;
ISA.46.1	Their images are 
ISA.46.1	The things that you carry are burdensome,
ISA.46.1	A load for the weary 
ISA.46.2	They stooped over, they have bowed down together;
ISA.46.2	They could not rescue the burden,
ISA.46.2	But have themselves gone into captivity.
ISA.46.3	“Listen to Me, O house of Jacob,
ISA.46.3	And all the remnant of the house of Israel,
ISA.46.3	You who have been borne by Me from birth
ISA.46.3	And have been carried from the womb;
ISA.46.4	Even to

ISA.46.4	I have done 
ISA.46.4	And I will bear 
ISA.46.5	“To whom would you liken Me
ISA.46.5	And make Me equal and compare Me,
ISA.46.5	That we would be alike?
ISA.46.6	Those who lavish gold from the purse
ISA.46.6	And weigh silver on the scale
ISA.46.6	Hire a goldsmith, and he makes it 
ISA.46.6	They bow down, indeed they worship it.
ISA.46.7	They lift it upon the shoulder 
ISA.46.7	They set it in its place and it stands 
ISA.46.7	It does not move from its place.
ISA.46.7	Though one may cry to it, it cannot answer;
ISA.46.7	It cannot deliver him from his distress.
ISA.46.8	“Remember this, and be assured;
ISA.46.8	Recall it to mind, you transgressors.
ISA.46.9	Remember the former things long past,
ISA.46.9	For I am God, and there is no other;

ISA.46.11	Calling a bird of prey from the east,
ISA.46.11	The man of My purpose from a far country.
ISA.46.11	Truly I have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass.
ISA.46.11	I have planned 
ISA.46.12	“Listen to Me, you stubborn-minded,
ISA.46.12	Who are far from righteousness.
ISA.46.13	I bring near My righteousness, it is not far off;
ISA.46.13	And My salvation will not delay.
ISA.46.13	And I will grant salvation in Zion,
ISA.47.1	“Come down and sit in the dust,
ISA.47.1	O virgin daughter of Babylon;

ISA.47.2	Take the millstones and grind meal.
ISA.47.2	Remove your veil, strip off the skirt,
ISA.47.2	Uncover the leg, cross the rivers.
ISA.47.3	Your nakedness will be uncovered,

ISA.47.4	Our Redeemer, the L
ISA.47.4	The Holy One of Israel.
ISA.47.5	“Sit silently, and go into darkness,
ISA.47.5	O daughter of the Chaldeans,
ISA.47.5	For you will no longer be called
ISA.47.5	The queen of kingdoms.
ISA.47.6	I was angry with My people,
ISA.47.6	I profaned My heritage
ISA.47.6	And gave them into your hand.
ISA.47.6	You did not show mercy to them,
ISA.47.6	On the aged you made your yoke very heavy.
ISA.47.7	Yet you said, ‘I will be a queen forever.’
ISA.47.7	These things you did not consider
ISA.47.7	Nor remember the outcome of them.
ISA.47.8	“Now, then, hear this, you sensual one,
ISA.47.8	Who dwells securely,

ISA.47.8	I will not sit as a widow,
ISA.47.8	Nor know loss of children.’
ISA.47.9	But these two things will come on you suddenly in one day:
ISA.47.9	Loss of children and widowhood.
ISA.47.9	They will come on you in full measure
ISA.47.9	In spite of your many sorceries,
ISA.47.9	In spite of the great power of your spells.
ISA.47.10	You felt secure in your wickedness and said,
ISA.47.10	‘No one sees me,’
ISA.47.10	Your wisdom and your knowledge, they have deluded you;
ISA.47.10	For you have said in your heart,
ISA.47.10	‘I am, and there is no one besides me.’
ISA.47.11	But evil will come on you
ISA.47.11	Which you will not know how to charm away;
ISA.47.11	And disaster will fall on you
ISA.47.11	For which you cannot atone;
ISA.47.11	And destruction about which you do not know
ISA.47.11	Will come on you suddenly.
ISA.47.12	“Stand 
ISA.47.12	And in your many sorceries
ISA.47.12	With which you have labored from your youth;
ISA.47.12	Perhaps you will be able to profit,
ISA.47.12	Perhaps you may cause trembling.
ISA.47.13	You are wearied with your many counsels;
ISA.47.13	Let now the astrologers,
ISA.47.13	Those who prophesy by the stars,
ISA.47.13	Those who predict by the new moons,
ISA.47.13	Stand up and save you from what will come upon you.
ISA.47.14	Behold, they have become like stubble,
ISA.47.14	Fire burns them;
ISA.47.14	They cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame;
ISA.47.14	There will be no coal to warm by
ISA.47.15	So have those become to you with whom you have labored,
ISA.47.15	Who have trafficked with you from your youth;
ISA.47.15	Each has wandered in his own way;
ISA.47.15	There is none to save you.
ISA.48.1	“Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are named Israel
ISA.48.1	And who came forth from the loins of Judah,
ISA.48.1	Who swear by the name of the L
ISA.48.1	And invoke the God of Israel,
ISA.48.2	For they call themselves after the holy city
ISA.48.2	And lean on the God of Israel;
ISA.48.2	The L
ISA.48.3	I declared the former things long ago
ISA.48.3	And they went forth from My mouth, and I proclaimed them.
ISA.48.3	Suddenly I acted, and they came to pass.
ISA.48.4	Because I know that you are obstinate,
ISA.48.4	And your neck is an iron sinew
ISA.48.4	And your forehead bronze,
ISA.48.5	Therefore I declared 
ISA.48.5	Before they took place I proclaimed 
ISA.48.5	So that you would not say, ‘My idol has done them,
ISA.48.5	And my graven image and my molten image have commanded them.’
ISA.48.6	You have heard; look at all this.
ISA.48.6	And you, will you not declare it?
ISA.48.6	I proclaim to you new things from this time,
ISA.48.6	Even hidden things which you have not known.
ISA.48.7	They are created now and not long ago;
ISA.48.7	And before today you have not heard them,
ISA.48.7	So that you will not say, ‘Behold, I knew them.’
ISA.48.8	You have not heard, you have not known.
ISA.48.8	Even from long ago your ear has not been open,
ISA.48.8	Because I knew that you would deal very treacherously;
ISA.48.8	And you have been called a rebel from birth.
ISA.48.9	For the sake of My name I delay My wrath,
ISA.48.9	And 
ISA.48.9	In order not to cut you off.
ISA.48.10	Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver;
ISA.48.10	I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.
ISA.48.11	For My own sake, for My own sake, I will act;
ISA.48.11	For how can 
ISA.48.11	And My glory I will not give to another.
ISA.48.12	“Listen to Me, O Jacob, even Israel whom I called;
ISA.48.12	I am He, I am the first, I am also the last.
ISA.48.13	Surely My hand founded the earth,
ISA.48.13	And My right hand spread out the heavens;
ISA.48.13	When I call to them, they stand together.
ISA.48.14	Assemble, all of you, and listen!
ISA.48.14	Who among them has declared these things?
ISA.48.14	The L
ISA.48.14	And His arm 
ISA.48.15	I, even I, have spoken; indeed I have called him,
ISA.48.15	I have brought him, and He will make his ways successful.
ISA.48.16	Come near to Me, listen to this:
ISA.48.16	From the first I have not spoken in secret,
ISA.48.16	From the time it took place, I was there.
ISA.48.16	And now the Lord G
ISA.48.17	Thus says the L
ISA.48.17	“I am the L
ISA.48.17	Who leads you in the way you should go.
ISA.48.18	If only you had paid attention to My commandments!
ISA.48.18	Then your well-being would have been like a river,
ISA.48.18	And your righteousness like the waves of the sea.
ISA.48.19	Your descendants would have been like the sand,
ISA.48.19	And your offspring like its grains;
ISA.48.19	Their name would never be cut off or destroyed from My presence.”
ISA.48.20	Go forth from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans!
ISA.48.20	Declare with the sound of joyful shouting, proclaim this,
ISA.48.20	Send it out to the end of the earth;
ISA.48.20	Say, “The L
ISA.48.21	They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts.
ISA.48.21	He made the water flow out of the rock for them;
ISA.48.21	He split the rock and the water gushed forth.
ISA.48.22	“There is no peace for the wicked,” says the L
ISA.49.1	Listen to Me, O islands,
ISA.49.1	And pay attention, you peoples from afar.
ISA.49.1	The L
ISA.49.1	From the body of My mother He named Me.
ISA.49.2	He has made My mouth like a sharp sword,
ISA.49.2	In the shadow of His hand He has concealed Me;
ISA.49.2	And He has also made Me a select arrow,
ISA.49.2	He has hidden Me in His quiver.
ISA.49.3	He said to Me, “You are My Servant, Israel,
ISA.49.3	In Whom I will show My glory.”
ISA.49.4	But I said, “I have toiled in vain,
ISA.49.4	I have spent My strength for nothing and vanity;
ISA.49.4	Yet surely the justice 
ISA.49.4	And My reward with My God.”
ISA.49.5	And now says the L
ISA.49.5	To bring Jacob back to Him, so that Israel might be gathered to Him
ISA.49.5	(For I am honored in the sight of the L
ISA.49.5	And My God is My strength),
ISA.49.6	He says, “It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant
ISA.49.6	To raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved ones of Israel;
ISA.49.6	I will also make You a light of the nations
ISA.49.6	So that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”
ISA.49.7	Thus says the L
ISA.49.7	To the despised One,
ISA.49.7	To the One abhorred by the nation,
ISA.49.7	To the Servant of rulers,
ISA.49.7	“Kings will see and arise,
ISA.49.7	Princes will also bow down,
ISA.49.7	Because of the L
ISA.49.8	Thus says the L
ISA.49.8	“In a favorable time I have answered You,
ISA.49.8	And in a day of salvation I have helped You;
ISA.49.8	And I will keep You and give You for a covenant of the people,
ISA.49.8	To restore the land, to make

ISA.49.10	They will not hunger or thirst,
ISA.49.10	Nor will the scorching heat or sun strike them down;
ISA.49.10	For He who has compassion on them will lead them
ISA.49.10	And will guide them to springs of water.
ISA.49.11	I will make all My mountains a road,
ISA.49.11	And My highways will be raised up.
ISA.49.12	Behold, these will come from afar;
ISA.49.12	And lo, these 
ISA.49.12	And these from the land of Sinim.”
ISA.49.13	Shout for joy, O heavens! And rejoice, O earth!
ISA.49.13	Break forth into joyful shouting, O mountains!
ISA.49.13	For the L
ISA.49.13	And will have compassion on His afflicted.
ISA.49.14	But Zion said, “The L
ISA.49.14	And the Lord has forgotten me.”
ISA.49.15	“Can a woman forget her nursing child
ISA.49.15	And have no compassion on the son of her womb?
ISA.49.15	Even these may forget, but I will not forget you.
ISA.49.16	Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms 
ISA.49.16	Your walls are continually before Me.
ISA.49.17	Your builders hurry;
ISA.49.17	Your destroyers and devastators
ISA.49.17	Will depart from you.
ISA.49.18	Lift up your eyes and look around;
ISA.49.18	All of them gather together, they come to you.
ISA.49.18	As I live,” declares the L
ISA.49.18	“You will surely put on all of them as jewels and bind them on as a bride.
ISA.49.19	For your waste and desolate places and your destroyed land—
ISA.49.19	Surely now you will be too cramped for the inhabitants,
ISA.49.19	And those who swallowed you will be far away.
ISA.49.20	The children of whom you were bereaved will yet say in your ears,
ISA.49.20	‘The place is too cramped for me;
ISA.49.20	Make room for me that I may live 
ISA.49.21	Then you will say in your heart,
ISA.49.21	‘Who has begotten these for me,
ISA.49.21	Since I have been bereaved of my children
ISA.49.21	And am barren, an exile and a wanderer?
ISA.49.21	And who has reared these?
ISA.49.21	Behold, I was left alone;
ISA.49.21	From where did these come?’ ”
ISA.49.22	Thus says the Lord G
ISA.49.22	“Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations
ISA.49.22	And set up My standard to the peoples;
ISA.49.22	And they will bring your sons in 
ISA.49.22	And your daughters will be carried on 
ISA.49.23	Kings will be your guardians,
ISA.49.23	And their princesses your nurses.
ISA.49.23	They will bow down to you with their faces to the earth
ISA.49.23	And lick the dust of your feet;
ISA.49.23	And 
ISA.49.23	Those who hopefully wait for Me will not be put to shame.
ISA.49.24	“Can the prey be taken from the mighty man,
ISA.49.24	Or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?”
ISA.49.25	Surely, thus says the L
ISA.49.25	“Even the captives of the mighty man will be taken away,
ISA.49.25	And the prey of the tyrant will be rescued;
ISA.49.25	For I will contend with the one who contends with you,
ISA.49.25	And I will save your sons.
ISA.49.26	I will feed your oppressors with their own flesh,
ISA.49.26	And they will become drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine;
ISA.49.26	And all flesh will know that I, the L
ISA.49.26	And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”
ISA.50.1	Thus says the L
ISA.50.1	“Where is the certificate of divorce
ISA.50.1	By which I have sent your mother away?
ISA.50.1	Or to whom of My creditors did I sell you?
ISA.50.1	Behold, you were sold for your iniquities,
ISA.50.1	And for your transgressions your mother was sent away.
ISA.50.2	Why was there no man when I came?
ISA.50.2	When I called, 
ISA.50.2	Is My hand so short that it cannot ransom?
ISA.50.2	Or have I no power to deliver?
ISA.50.2	Behold, I dry up the sea with My rebuke,
ISA.50.2	I make the rivers a wilderness;
ISA.50.2	Their fish stink for lack of water
ISA.50.2	And die of thirst.
ISA.50.3	I clothe the heavens with blackness
ISA.50.3	And make sackcloth their covering.”
ISA.50.4	The Lord G
ISA.50.4	That I may know how to sustain the weary one with a word.
ISA.50.4	He awakens 
ISA.50.4	He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple.
ISA.50.5	The Lord G
ISA.50.5	And I was not disobedient
ISA.50.5	Nor did I turn back.
ISA.50.6	I gave My back to those who strike 
ISA.50.6	And My cheeks to those who pluck out the beard;
ISA.50.6	I did not cover My face from humiliation and spitting.
ISA.50.7	For the Lord G
ISA.50.7	Therefore, I am not disgraced;
ISA.50.7	Therefore, I have set My face like flint,
ISA.50.7	And I know that I will not be ashamed.
ISA.50.8	He who vindicates Me is near;
ISA.50.8	Who will contend with Me?
ISA.50.8	Let us stand up to each other;
ISA.50.8	Who has a case against Me?
ISA.50.8	Let him draw near to Me.
ISA.50.9	Behold, the Lord G
ISA.50.9	Who is he who condemns Me?
ISA.50.9	Behold, they will all wear out like a garment;
ISA.50.9	The moth will eat them.
ISA.50.10	Who is among you that fears the L
ISA.50.10	That obeys the voice of His servant,
ISA.50.10	That walks in darkness and has no light?
ISA.50.10	Let him trust in the name of the L
ISA.50.11	Behold, all you who kindle a fire,
ISA.50.11	Who encircle yourselves with firebrands,
ISA.50.11	Walk in the light of your fire
ISA.50.11	And among the brands you have set ablaze.
ISA.50.11	This you will have from My hand:
ISA.50.11	You will lie down in torment.
ISA.51.1	“Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness,
ISA.51.1	Who seek the L
ISA.51.1	Look to the rock from which you were hewn
ISA.51.1	And to the quarry from which you were dug.
ISA.51.2	Look to Abraham your father
ISA.51.2	And to Sarah who gave birth to you in pain;
ISA.51.2	When 
ISA.51.2	Then I blessed him and multiplied him.”
ISA.51.3	Indeed, the L
ISA.51.3	He will comfort all her waste places.
ISA.51.3	And her wilderness He will make like Eden,
ISA.51.3	And her desert like the garden of the L
ISA.51.3	Joy and gladness will be found in her,
ISA.51.3	Thanksgiving and sound of a melody.
ISA.51.4	“Pay attention to Me, O My people,
ISA.51.4	And give ear to Me, O My nation;
ISA.51.4	For a law will go forth from Me,
ISA.51.4	And I will set My justice for a light of the peoples.
ISA.51.5	My righteousness is near, My salvation has gone forth,
ISA.51.5	And My arms will judge the peoples;
ISA.51.5	The coastlands will wait for Me,
ISA.51.5	And for My arm they will wait expectantly.
ISA.51.6	Lift up your eyes to the sky,
ISA.51.6	Then look to the earth beneath;
ISA.51.6	For the sky will vanish like smoke,
ISA.51.6	And the earth will wear out like a garment
ISA.51.6	And its inhabitants will die in like manner;
ISA.51.6	But My salvation will be forever,
ISA.51.6	And My righteousness will not wane.
ISA.51.7	Listen to Me, you who know righteousness,
ISA.51.7	A people in whose heart is My law;
ISA.51.7	Do not fear the reproach of man,
ISA.51.7	Nor be dismayed at their revilings.
ISA.51.8	For the moth will eat them like a garment,
ISA.51.8	And the grub will eat them like wool.
ISA.51.8	But My righteousness will be forever,
ISA.51.8	And My salvation to all generations.”
ISA.51.9	Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the L
ISA.51.9	Awake as in the days of old, the generations of long ago.
ISA.51.9	Was it not You who cut Rahab in pieces,
ISA.51.9	Who pierced the dragon?
ISA.51.10	Was it not You who dried up the sea,
ISA.51.10	The waters of the great deep;
ISA.51.10	Who made the depths of the sea a pathway
ISA.51.10	For the redeemed to cross over?
ISA.51.11	So the ransomed of the L
ISA.51.11	And come with joyful shouting to Zion,
ISA.51.11	And everlasting joy 
ISA.51.11	They will obtain gladness and joy,
ISA.51.11	And sorrow and sighing will flee away.
ISA.51.12	“I, even I, am He who comforts you.
ISA.51.12	Who are you that you are afraid of man who dies
ISA.51.12	And of the son of man who is made like grass,
ISA.51.13	That you have forgotten the L
ISA.51.13	Who stretched out the heavens
ISA.51.13	And laid the foundations of the earth,
ISA.51.13	That you fear continually all day long because of the fury of the oppressor,
ISA.51.13	As he makes ready to destroy?
ISA.51.13	But where is the fury of the oppressor?
ISA.51.14	The exile will soon be set free, and will not die in the dungeon, nor will his bread be lacking. 
ISA.51.15	For I am the L
ISA.51.16	I have put My words in your mouth and have covered you with the shadow of My hand, to establish the heavens, to found the earth, and to say to Zion, ‘You are My people.’ ”
ISA.51.17	Rouse yourself! Rouse yourself! Arise, O Jerusalem,
ISA.51.17	You who have drunk from the L
ISA.51.17	The chalice of reeling you have drained to the dregs.
ISA.51.18	There is none to guide her among all the sons she has borne,
ISA.51.18	Nor is there one to take her by the hand among all the sons she has reared.
ISA.51.19	These two things have befallen you;
ISA.51.19	Who will mourn for you?
ISA.51.19	The devastation and destruction, famine and sword;
ISA.51.19	How shall I comfort you?
ISA.51.20	Your sons have fainted,
ISA.51.20	They lie 
ISA.51.20	Like an antelope in a net,
ISA.51.20	Full of the wrath of the L
ISA.51.20	The rebuke of your God.
ISA.51.21	Therefore, please hear this, you afflicted,
ISA.51.21	Who are drunk, but not with wine:
ISA.51.22	Thus says your Lord, the L
ISA.51.22	Who contends for His people,
ISA.51.22	“Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of reeling,
ISA.51.22	The chalice of My anger;
ISA.51.22	You will never drink it again.
ISA.51.23	I will put it into the hand of your tormentors,
ISA.51.23	Who have said to you, ‘Lie down that we may walk over 
ISA.51.23	You have even made your back like the ground
ISA.51.23	And like the street for those who walk over 
ISA.52.1	Awake, awake,
ISA.52.1	Clothe yourself in your strength, O Zion;
ISA.52.1	Clothe yourself in your beautiful garments,
ISA.52.1	O Jerusalem, the holy city;
ISA.52.1	For the uncircumcised and the unclean
ISA.52.1	Will no longer come into you.
ISA.52.2	Shake yourself from the dust, rise up,
ISA.52.2	O captive Jerusalem;
ISA.52.2	Loose yourself from the chains around your neck,
ISA.52.2	O captive daughter of Zion.
ISA.52.3	For thus says the L
ISA.52.4	For thus says the Lord G
ISA.52.5	Now therefore, what do I have here,” declares the L
ISA.52.6	Therefore My people shall know My name; therefore in that day I am the one who is speaking, ‘Here I am.’ ”
ISA.52.7	How lovely on the mountains
ISA.52.7	Are the feet of him who brings good news,
ISA.52.7	Who announces peace
ISA.52.7	And brings good news of happiness,
ISA.52.7	Who announces salvation,
ISA.52.8	Listen! Your watchmen lift up 
ISA.52.8	They shout joyfully together;
ISA.52.8	For they will see with their own eyes
ISA.52.8	When the L
ISA.52.9	Break forth, shout joyfully together,
ISA.52.9	You waste places of Jerusalem;
ISA.52.9	For the L
ISA.52.9	He has redeemed Jerusalem.
ISA.52.10	The L
ISA.52.10	In the sight of all the nations,
ISA.52.10	That all the ends of the earth may see
ISA.52.10	The salvation of our God.
ISA.52.11	Depart, depart, go out from there,
ISA.52.11	Touch nothing unclean;
ISA.52.11	Go out of the midst of her, purify yourselves,
ISA.52.11	You who carry the vessels of the L
ISA.52.12	But you will not go out in haste,
ISA.52.12	Nor will you go as fugitives;
ISA.52.12	For the L
ISA.52.12	And the God of Israel 
ISA.52.13	Behold, My servant will prosper,
ISA.52.13	He will be high and lifted up and greatly exalted.
ISA.52.14	Just as many were astonished at you, 
ISA.52.14	So His appearance was marred more than any man
ISA.52.14	And His form more than the sons of men.
ISA.52.15	Thus He will sprinkle many nations,
ISA.52.15	Kings will shut their mouths on account of Him;
ISA.52.15	For what had not been told them they will see,
ISA.52.15	And what they had not heard they will understand.
ISA.53.1	Who has believed our message?
ISA.53.1	And to whom has the arm of the L
ISA.53.2	For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot,
ISA.53.2	And like a root out of parched ground;
ISA.53.2	He has no 
ISA.53.2	That we should look upon Him,
ISA.53.2	Nor appearance that we should 
ISA.53.3	He was despised and forsaken of men,
ISA.53.3	A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;
ISA.53.3	And like one from whom men hide their face
ISA.53.3	He was despised, and we did not esteem Him.
ISA.53.4	Surely our 
ISA.53.4	And our sorrows He carried;
ISA.53.4	Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken,
ISA.53.4	Smitten of God, and afflicted.
ISA.53.5	But He was 
ISA.53.5	He was crushed for our iniquities;
ISA.53.5	The chastening for our well-being 
ISA.53.5	And by His scourging we are healed.
ISA.53.6	All of us like sheep have gone astray,
ISA.53.6	Each of us has turned to his own way;
ISA.53.6	But the L
ISA.53.6	To fall on Him.
ISA.53.7	He was oppressed and He was afflicted,
ISA.53.7	Yet He did not open His mouth;
ISA.53.7	Like a lamb that is led to slaughter,
ISA.53.7	And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers,
ISA.53.7	So He did not open His mouth.
ISA.53.8	By oppression and judgment He was taken away;
ISA.53.8	And as for His generation, who considered
ISA.53.8	That He was cut off out of the land of the living
ISA.53.8	For the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke 
ISA.53.9	His grave was assigned with wicked men,
ISA.53.9	Yet He was with a rich man in His death,
ISA.53.9	Because He had done no violence,
ISA.53.9	Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.
ISA.53.10	But the L
ISA.53.10	To crush Him, putting 
ISA.53.10	If He would render Himself 
ISA.53.10	He will see 
ISA.53.10	He will prolong 
ISA.53.10	And the good pleasure of the L
ISA.53.11	As a result of the anguish of His soul,
ISA.53.11	He will see 
ISA.53.11	By His knowledge the Righteous One,
ISA.53.11	My Servant, will justify the many,
ISA.53.11	As He will bear their iniquities.
ISA.53.12	Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great,
ISA.53.12	And He will divide the booty with the strong;
ISA.53.12	Because He poured out Himself to death,
ISA.53.12	And was numbered with the transgressors;
ISA.53.12	Yet He Himself bore the sin of many,
ISA.53.12	And interceded for the transgressors.
ISA.54.1	“Shout for joy, O barren one, you who have borne no 
ISA.54.1	Break forth into joyful shouting and cry aloud, you who have not travailed;
ISA.54.1	For the sons of the desolate one 
ISA.54.1	Than the sons of the married woman,” says the L
ISA.54.2	“Enlarge the place of your tent;
ISA.54.2	Stretch out the curtains of your dwellings, spare not;

ISA.54.4	“Fear not, for you will not be put to shame;
ISA.54.4	And do not feel humiliated, for you will not be disgraced;
ISA.54.4	But you will forget the shame of your youth,
ISA.54.4	And the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more.
ISA.54.5	For your husband is your Maker,
ISA.54.5	Whose name is the L
ISA.54.5	And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.54.5	Who is called the God of all the earth.
ISA.54.6	For the L
ISA.54.6	Like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit,
ISA.54.6	Even like a wife of

ISA.54.7	“For a brief moment I forsook you,
ISA.54.7	But with great compassion I will gather you.
ISA.54.8	In an outburst of anger
ISA.54.8	I hid My face from you for a moment,
ISA.54.8	But with everlasting lovingkindness I will have compassion on you,”
ISA.54.8	Says the L
ISA.54.9	“For this is like the days of Noah to Me,
ISA.54.9	When I swore that the waters of Noah
ISA.54.9	Would not flood the earth again;
ISA.54.9	So I have sworn that I will not be angry with you
ISA.54.9	Nor will I rebuke you.
ISA.54.10	For the mountains may be removed and the hills may shake,
ISA.54.10	But My lovingkindness will not be removed from you,
ISA.54.10	And My covenant of peace will not be shaken,”
ISA.54.10	Says the L
ISA.54.11	“O afflicted one, storm-tossed, 
ISA.54.11	Behold, I will set your stones in antimony,
ISA.54.11	And your foundations I will lay in sapphires.
ISA.54.12	Moreover, I will make your battlements of rubies,
ISA.54.12	And your gates of crystal,
ISA.54.12	And your entire wall of precious stones.
ISA.54.13	All your sons will be taught of the L
ISA.54.13	And the well-being of your sons will be great.
ISA.54.14	In righteousness you will be established;
ISA.54.14	You will be far from oppression, for you will not fear;
ISA.54.14	And from terror, for it will not come near you.
ISA.54.15	If anyone fiercely assails 
ISA.54.15	Whoever assails you will fall because of you.
ISA.54.16	Behold, I Myself have created the smith who blows the fire of coals
ISA.54.16	And brings out a weapon for its work;
ISA.54.16	And I have created the destroyer to ruin.
ISA.54.17	No weapon that is formed against you will prosper;
ISA.54.17	And every tongue that accuses you in judgment you will condemn.
ISA.54.17	This is the heritage of the servants of the L
ISA.54.17	And their vindication is from Me,” declares the L
ISA.55.1	“Ho! Every one who thirsts, come to the waters;
ISA.55.1	And you who have no money come, buy and eat.
ISA.55.1	Come, buy wine and milk
ISA.55.1	Without money and without cost.
ISA.55.2	Why do you spend money for what is not bread,
ISA.55.2	And your wages for what does not satisfy?
ISA.55.2	Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good,
ISA.55.2	And delight yourself in abundance.
ISA.55.3	Incline your ear and come to Me.
ISA.55.3	Listen, that you may live;
ISA.55.3	And I will make an everlasting covenant with you,
ISA.55.4	Behold, I have made him a witness to the peoples,
ISA.55.4	A leader and commander for the peoples.
ISA.55.5	Behold, you will call a nation you do not know,
ISA.55.5	And a nation which knows you not will run to you,
ISA.55.5	Because of the L
ISA.55.5	For He has glorified you.”
ISA.55.6	Seek the L
ISA.55.6	Call upon Him while He is near.
ISA.55.7	Let the wicked forsake his way
ISA.55.7	And the unrighteous man his thoughts;
ISA.55.7	And let him return to the L
ISA.55.7	And He will have compassion on him,
ISA.55.7	And to our God,
ISA.55.7	For He will abundantly pardon.
ISA.55.8	“For My thoughts are not your thoughts,
ISA.55.8	Nor are your ways My ways,” declares the L
ISA.55.9	“For 
ISA.55.9	So are My ways higher than your ways
ISA.55.9	And My thoughts than your thoughts.
ISA.55.10	For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven,
ISA.55.10	And do not return there without watering the earth
ISA.55.10	And making it bear and sprout,
ISA.55.10	And furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
ISA.55.11	So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;
ISA.55.11	It will not return to Me empty,
ISA.55.11	Without accomplishing what I desire,
ISA.55.11	And without succeeding 
ISA.55.12	For you will go out with joy
ISA.55.12	And be led forth with peace;
ISA.55.12	The mountains and the hills will break forth into shouts of joy before you,
ISA.55.12	And all the trees of the field will clap 
ISA.55.13	Instead of the thorn bush the cypress will come up,
ISA.55.13	And instead of the nettle the myrtle will come up,
ISA.55.13	And it will be a memorial to the L
ISA.55.13	For an everlasting sign which will not be cut off.”
ISA.56.1	Thus says the L
ISA.56.1	“Preserve justice and do righteousness,
ISA.56.1	For My salvation is about to come
ISA.56.1	And My righteousness to be revealed.
ISA.56.2	How blessed is the man who does this,
ISA.56.2	And the son of man who takes hold of it;
ISA.56.2	Who keeps from profaning the sabbath,
ISA.56.2	And keeps his hand from doing any evil.”
ISA.56.3	Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the L
ISA.56.3	“The L
ISA.56.3	Nor let the eunuch say, “Behold, I am a dry tree.”
ISA.56.4	For thus says the L
ISA.56.4	“To the eunuchs who keep My sabbaths,
ISA.56.4	And choose what pleases Me,
ISA.56.4	And hold fast My covenant,
ISA.56.5	To them I will give in My house and within My walls a memorial,
ISA.56.5	And a name better than that of sons and daughters;
ISA.56.5	I will give them an everlasting name which will not be cut off.
ISA.56.6	“Also the foreigners who join themselves to the L
ISA.56.6	To minister to Him, and to love the name of the L
ISA.56.6	To be His servants, every one who keeps from profaning the sabbath
ISA.56.6	And holds fast My covenant;
ISA.56.7	Even those I will bring to My holy mountain
ISA.56.7	And make them joyful in My house of prayer.
ISA.56.7	Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar;
ISA.56.7	For My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples.”
ISA.56.8	The Lord G
ISA.56.8	“Yet 
ISA.56.9	All you beasts of the field,
ISA.56.9	All you beasts in the forest,
ISA.56.9	Come to eat.

ISA.56.10	All of them know nothing.
ISA.56.10	All of them are mute dogs unable to bark,
ISA.56.10	Dreamers lying down, who love to slumber;
ISA.56.11	And the dogs are greedy, they are not satisfied.
ISA.56.11	And they are shepherds who have no understanding;
ISA.56.11	They have all turned to their own way,
ISA.56.11	Each one to his unjust gain, to the last one.
ISA.56.12	“Come,” 
ISA.56.12	And tomorrow will be like today, only more so.”
ISA.57.1	The righteous man perishes, and no man takes it to heart;
ISA.57.1	And devout men are taken away, while no one understands.
ISA.57.1	For the righteous man is taken away from evil,
ISA.57.2	He enters into peace;
ISA.57.2	They rest in their beds,
ISA.57.3	“But come here, you sons of a sorceress,
ISA.57.3	Offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute.
ISA.57.4	Against whom do you jest?
ISA.57.4	Against whom do you open wide your mouth
ISA.57.4	And stick out your tongue?
ISA.57.4	Are you not children of rebellion,
ISA.57.4	Offspring of deceit,
ISA.57.5	Under every luxuriant tree,
ISA.57.5	Who slaughter the children in the ravines,
ISA.57.5	Under the clefts of the crags?
ISA.57.6	Among the smooth 
ISA.57.6	Is your portion, they are your lot;
ISA.57.6	Even to them you have poured out a drink offering,
ISA.57.6	You have made a grain offering.
ISA.57.6	Shall I relent concerning these things?
ISA.57.7	Upon a high and lofty mountain
ISA.57.7	You have made your bed.
ISA.57.7	You also went up there to offer sacrifice.
ISA.57.8	Behind the door and the doorpost
ISA.57.8	You have set up your sign;
ISA.57.8	Indeed, far removed from Me, you have uncovered yourself,
ISA.57.8	And have gone up and made your bed wide.
ISA.57.8	And you have made an agreement for yourself with them,
ISA.57.8	You have loved their bed,
ISA.57.8	You have looked on 
ISA.57.9	You have journeyed to the king with oil
ISA.57.9	And increased your perfumes;
ISA.57.9	You have sent your envoys a great distance
ISA.57.9	And made 
ISA.57.10	You were tired out by the length of your road,
ISA.57.10	You found renewed strength,
ISA.57.10	Therefore you did not faint.
ISA.57.11	“Of whom were you worried and fearful
ISA.57.11	When you lied, and did not remember Me
ISA.57.11	Nor give 
ISA.57.11	Was I not silent even for a long time
ISA.57.11	So you do not fear Me?
ISA.57.12	I will declare your righteousness and your deeds,
ISA.57.12	But they will not profit you.
ISA.57.13	When you cry out, let your collection 
ISA.57.13	But the wind will carry all of them up,
ISA.57.13	But he who takes refuge in Me will inherit the land
ISA.57.13	And will possess My holy mountain.”
ISA.57.14	And it will be said,
ISA.57.14	“Build up, build up, prepare the way,
ISA.57.14	Remove

ISA.57.15	And 
ISA.57.15	In order to revive the spirit of the lowly
ISA.57.15	And to revive the heart of the contrite.
ISA.57.16	For I will not contend forever,
ISA.57.16	Nor will I always be angry;
ISA.57.16	For the spirit would grow faint before Me,
ISA.57.16	And the breath 
ISA.57.17	Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry and struck him;
ISA.57.17	I hid 
ISA.57.17	And he went on turning away, in the way of his heart.
ISA.57.18	I have seen his ways, but I will heal him;
ISA.57.18	I will lead him and restore comfort to him and to his mourners,
ISA.57.19	Creating the praise of the lips.
ISA.57.19	Peace, peace to him who is far and to him who is near,”
ISA.57.19	Says the L
ISA.57.20	But the wicked are like the tossing sea,
ISA.57.20	For it cannot be quiet,
ISA.57.20	And its waters toss up refuse and mud.
ISA.57.21	“There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”
ISA.58.1	“Cry loudly, do not hold back;
ISA.58.1	Raise your voice like a trumpet,
ISA.58.1	And declare to My people their transgression
ISA.58.1	And to the house of Jacob their sins.
ISA.58.2	Yet they seek Me day by day and delight to know My ways,
ISA.58.2	As a nation that has done righteousness
ISA.58.2	And has not forsaken the ordinance of their God.
ISA.58.2	They ask Me 
ISA.58.2	They delight in the nearness of God.
ISA.58.3	‘Why have we fasted and You do not see?
ISA.58.3	Behold, on the day of your fast you find 
ISA.58.3	And drive hard all your workers.
ISA.58.4	Behold, you fast for contention and strife and to strike with a wicked fist.
ISA.58.4	You do not fast like 
ISA.58.5	Is it a fast like this which I choose, a day for a man to humble himself?
ISA.58.5	Is it for bowing one’s head like a reed
ISA.58.5	And for spreading out sackcloth and ashes as a bed?
ISA.58.5	Will you call this a fast, even an acceptable day to the L
ISA.58.6	Is this not the fast which I choose,
ISA.58.6	To loosen the bonds of wickedness,
ISA.58.6	To undo the bands of the yoke,
ISA.58.6	And to let the oppressed go free
ISA.58.6	And break every yoke?
ISA.58.7	Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry
ISA.58.7	And bring the homeless poor into the house;
ISA.58.7	When you see the naked, to cover him;
ISA.58.7	And not to hide yourself from your own flesh?
ISA.58.8	Then your light will break out like the dawn,
ISA.58.8	And your recovery will speedily spring forth;
ISA.58.8	And your righteousness will go before you;
ISA.58.8	The glory of the L
ISA.58.9	Then you will call, and the L
ISA.58.9	You will cry, and He will say, ‘Here I am.’
ISA.58.9	If you remove the yoke from your midst,
ISA.58.9	The pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness,
ISA.58.10	And if you give yourself to the hungry
ISA.58.10	And satisfy the desire of the afflicted,
ISA.58.10	Then your light will rise in darkness
ISA.58.10	And your gloom 
ISA.58.11	And the L
ISA.58.11	And satisfy your desire in scorched places,
ISA.58.11	And give strength to your bones;
ISA.58.11	And you will be like a watered garden,
ISA.58.11	And like a spring of water whose waters do not fail.
ISA.58.12	Those from among you will rebuild the ancient ruins;
ISA.58.12	You will raise up the age-old foundations;
ISA.58.12	And you will be called the repairer of the breach,
ISA.58.12	The restorer of the streets in which to dwell.
ISA.58.13	“If because of the sabbath, you turn your foot
ISA.58.13	From doing your 
ISA.58.13	And call the sabbath a delight, the holy 
ISA.58.13	And honor it, desisting from your 
ISA.58.13	From seeking your 
ISA.58.13	And speaking 
ISA.58.14	Then you will take delight in the L
ISA.58.14	And I will make you ride on the heights of the earth;
ISA.58.14	And I will feed you 
ISA.58.14	For the mouth of the L
ISA.59.1	Behold, the L
ISA.59.1	That it cannot save;
ISA.59.1	Nor is His ear so dull
ISA.59.1	That it cannot hear.
ISA.59.2	But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God,
ISA.59.2	And your sins have hidden 
ISA.59.3	For your hands are defiled with blood
ISA.59.3	And your fingers with iniquity;
ISA.59.3	Your lips have spoken falsehood,
ISA.59.3	Your tongue mutters wickedness.
ISA.59.4	No one sues righteously and no one pleads honestly.
ISA.59.4	They trust in confusion and speak lies;
ISA.59.4	They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.
ISA.59.5	They hatch adders’ eggs and weave the spider’s web;
ISA.59.5	He who eats of their eggs dies,
ISA.59.5	And 
ISA.59.6	Their webs will not become clothing,
ISA.59.6	Nor will they cover themselves with their works;
ISA.59.6	Their works are works of iniquity,
ISA.59.6	And an act of violence is in their hands.
ISA.59.7	Their feet run to evil,
ISA.59.7	And they hasten to shed innocent blood;
ISA.59.7	Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity,
ISA.59.7	Devastation and destruction are in their highways.
ISA.59.8	They do not know the way of peace,
ISA.59.8	And there is no justice in their tracks;
ISA.59.8	They have made their paths crooked,
ISA.59.8	Whoever treads on them does not know peace.
ISA.59.9	Therefore justice is far from us,
ISA.59.9	And righteousness does not overtake us;
ISA.59.9	We hope for light, but behold, darkness,
ISA.59.9	For brightness, but we walk in gloom.
ISA.59.10	We grope along the wall like blind men,
ISA.59.10	We grope like those who have no eyes;
ISA.59.10	We stumble at midday as in the twilight,
ISA.59.10	Among those who are vigorous 
ISA.59.11	All of us growl like bears,
ISA.59.11	And moan sadly like doves;
ISA.59.11	We hope for justice, but there is none,
ISA.59.11	For salvation, 
ISA.59.12	For our transgressions are multiplied before You,
ISA.59.12	And our sins testify against us;
ISA.59.12	For our transgressions are with us,
ISA.59.12	And we know our iniquities:
ISA.59.13	Transgressing and denying the L
ISA.59.13	And turning away from our God,
ISA.59.13	Speaking oppression and revolt,
ISA.59.13	Conceiving 
ISA.59.14	Justice is turned back,
ISA.59.14	And righteousness stands far away;
ISA.59.14	For truth has stumbled in the street,
ISA.59.14	And uprightness cannot enter.
ISA.59.15	Yes, truth is lacking;
ISA.59.15	And he who turns aside from evil makes himself a prey.
ISA.59.15	And it was displeasing in His sight that there was no justice.
ISA.59.16	And He saw that there was no man,
ISA.59.16	And was astonished that there was no one to intercede;
ISA.59.16	Then His own arm brought salvation to Him,
ISA.59.16	And His righteousness upheld Him.
ISA.59.17	He put on righteousness like a breastplate,
ISA.59.17	And a helmet of salvation on His head;
ISA.59.17	And He put on garments of vengeance for clothing
ISA.59.17	And wrapped Himself with zeal as a mantle.
ISA.59.18	According to 
ISA.59.18	Wrath to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies;
ISA.59.18	To the coastlands He will make recompense.
ISA.59.19	So they will fear the name of the L
ISA.59.19	And His glory from the rising of the sun,
ISA.59.19	For He will come like a rushing stream
ISA.59.19	Which the wind of the L
ISA.59.20	“A Redeemer will come to Zion,
ISA.59.20	And to those who turn from transgression in Jacob,” declares the L
ISA.59.21	“As for Me, this is My covenant with them,” says the L
ISA.60.1	“Arise, shine; for your light has come,
ISA.60.1	And the glory of the L

ISA.60.2	And deep darkness the peoples;
ISA.60.2	But the L
ISA.60.2	And His glory will appear upon you.
ISA.60.3	Nations will come to your light,
ISA.60.3	And kings to the brightness of your rising.
ISA.60.4	“Lift up your eyes round about and see;
ISA.60.4	They all gather together, they come to you.
ISA.60.4	Your sons will come from afar,
ISA.60.4	And your daughters will be carried in the arms.
ISA.60.5	Then you will see and be radiant,
ISA.60.5	And your heart will thrill and rejoice;
ISA.60.5	Because the abundance of the sea will be turned to you,
ISA.60.5	The wealth of the nations will come to you.
ISA.60.6	A multitude of camels will cover you,
ISA.60.6	The young camels of Midian and Ephah;
ISA.60.6	All those from Sheba will come;
ISA.60.6	They will bring gold and frankincense,
ISA.60.6	And will bear good news of the praises of the L
ISA.60.7	All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered together to you,
ISA.60.7	The rams of Nebaioth will minister to you;
ISA.60.7	They will go up with acceptance on My altar,
ISA.60.7	And I shall glorify My glorious house.
ISA.60.8	Who are these who fly like a cloud
ISA.60.8	And like the doves to their lattices?
ISA.60.9	Surely the coastlands will wait for Me;
ISA.60.9	And the ships of Tarshish 
ISA.60.9	To bring your sons from afar,
ISA.60.9	Their silver and their gold with them,
ISA.60.9	For the name of the L
ISA.60.9	And for the Holy One of Israel because He has glorified you.
ISA.60.10	“Foreigners will build up your walls,
ISA.60.10	And their kings will minister to you;
ISA.60.10	For in My wrath I struck you,
ISA.60.10	And in My favor I have had compassion on you.
ISA.60.11	Your gates will be open continually;
ISA.60.11	They will not be closed day or night,
ISA.60.11	So that 
ISA.60.11	With their kings led in procession.
ISA.60.12	For the nation and the kingdom which will not serve you will perish,
ISA.60.12	And the nations will be utterly ruined.
ISA.60.13	The glory of Lebanon will come to you,
ISA.60.13	The juniper, the box tree and the cypress together,
ISA.60.13	To beautify the place of My sanctuary;
ISA.60.13	And I shall make the place of My feet glorious.
ISA.60.14	The sons of those who afflicted you will come bowing to you,
ISA.60.14	And all those who despised you will bow themselves at the soles of your feet;
ISA.60.14	And they will call you the city of the L
ISA.60.14	The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.60.15	“Whereas you have been forsaken and hated
ISA.60.15	With no one passing through,
ISA.60.15	I will make you an everlasting pride,
ISA.60.15	A joy from generation to generation.
ISA.60.16	You will also suck the milk of nations
ISA.60.16	And suck the breast of kings;
ISA.60.16	Then you will know that I, the L
ISA.60.16	And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
ISA.60.17	Instead of bronze I will bring gold,
ISA.60.17	And instead of iron I will bring silver,
ISA.60.17	And instead of wood, bronze,
ISA.60.17	And instead of stones, iron.
ISA.60.17	And I will make peace your administrators
ISA.60.17	And righteousness your overseers.
ISA.60.18	Violence will not be heard again in your land,
ISA.60.18	Nor devastation or destruction within your borders;
ISA.60.18	But you will call your walls salvation, and your gates praise.
ISA.60.19	No longer will you have the sun for light by day,
ISA.60.19	Nor for brightness will the moon give you light;
ISA.60.19	But you will have the L
ISA.60.19	And your God for your glory.
ISA.60.20	Your sun will no longer set,
ISA.60.20	Nor will your moon wane;
ISA.60.20	For you will have the L
ISA.60.20	And the days of your mourning will be over.
ISA.60.21	Then all your people 
ISA.60.21	They will possess the land forever,
ISA.60.21	The branch of My planting,
ISA.60.21	The work of My hands,
ISA.60.21	That I may be glorified.
ISA.60.22	The smallest one will become a clan,

ISA.61.1	He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
ISA.61.1	To proclaim liberty to captives
ISA.61.1	And freedom to prisoners;
ISA.61.2	To proclaim the favorable year of the L
ISA.61.2	And the day of vengeance of our God;
ISA.61.2	To comfort all who mourn,
ISA.61.3	To grant those who mourn 
ISA.61.3	Giving them a garland instead of ashes,
ISA.61.3	The oil of gladness instead of mourning,
ISA.61.3	The mantle of praise instead of a spirit of fainting.
ISA.61.3	So they will be called oaks of righteousness,
ISA.61.3	The planting of the L
ISA.61.4	Then they will rebuild the ancient ruins,
ISA.61.4	They will raise up the former devastations;
ISA.61.4	And they will repair the ruined cities,
ISA.61.4	The desolations of many generations.
ISA.61.5	Strangers will stand and pasture your flocks,
ISA.61.5	And foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers.
ISA.61.6	But you will be called the priests of the L
ISA.61.6	You will be spoken of 
ISA.61.6	You will eat the wealth of nations,
ISA.61.6	And in their riches you will boast.
ISA.61.7	Instead of your shame 
ISA.61.7	And 
ISA.61.7	Therefore they will possess a double 
ISA.61.7	Everlasting joy will be theirs.
ISA.61.8	For I, the L
ISA.61.8	I hate robbery in the burnt offering;
ISA.61.8	And I will faithfully give them their recompense
ISA.61.8	And make an everlasting covenant with them.
ISA.61.9	Then their offspring will be known among the nations,
ISA.61.9	And their descendants in the midst of the peoples.
ISA.61.9	All who see them will recognize them
ISA.61.9	Because they are the offspring 
ISA.61.10	I will rejoice greatly in the L
ISA.61.10	My soul will exult in my God;
ISA.61.10	For He has clothed me with garments of salvation,
ISA.61.10	He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness,
ISA.61.10	As a bridegroom decks himself with a garland,

ISA.62.1	For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent,
ISA.62.1	And for Jerusalem’s sake I will not keep quiet,
ISA.62.1	Until her righteousness goes forth like brightness,
ISA.62.1	And her salvation like a torch that is burning.
ISA.62.2	The nations will see your righteousness,
ISA.62.2	And all kings your glory;
ISA.62.2	And you will be called by a new name
ISA.62.2	Which the mouth of the L
ISA.62.3	You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the L
ISA.62.3	And a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
ISA.62.4	It will no longer be said to you, “Forsaken,”
ISA.62.4	Nor to your land will it any longer be said, “Desolate”;
ISA.62.4	But you will be called, “My delight is in her,”
ISA.62.4	And your land, “Married”;
ISA.62.4	For the L
ISA.62.4	And 
ISA.62.5	For 
ISA.62.5	And 
ISA.62.6	On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen;
ISA.62.6	All day and all night they will never keep silent.
ISA.62.6	You who remind the L
ISA.62.7	And give Him no rest until He establishes
ISA.62.7	And makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
ISA.62.8	The L
ISA.62.8	“I will never again give your grain 
ISA.62.8	Nor will foreigners drink your new wine for which you have labored.”
ISA.62.9	But those who garner it will eat it and praise the L
ISA.62.9	And those who gather it will drink it in the courts of My sanctuary.
ISA.62.10	Go through, go through the gates,
ISA.62.10	Clear the way for the people;
ISA.62.10	Build up, build up the highway,
ISA.62.10	Remove the stones, lift up a standard over the peoples.
ISA.62.11	Behold, the L
ISA.62.11	Say to the daughter of Zion, “Lo, your salvation comes;
ISA.62.11	Behold His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him.”
ISA.62.12	And they will call them, “The holy people,
ISA.62.12	The redeemed of the L
ISA.62.12	And you will be called, “Sought out, a city not forsaken.”
ISA.63.1	Who is this who comes from Edom,
ISA.63.1	With garments of glowing colors from Bozrah,
ISA.63.1	This One who is majestic in His apparel,
ISA.63.1	Marching in the greatness of His strength?
ISA.63.1	“It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.”
ISA.63.2	Why is Your apparel red,
ISA.63.2	And Your garments like the one who treads in the wine press?
ISA.63.3	“I have trodden the wine trough alone,
ISA.63.3	And from the peoples there was no man with Me.
ISA.63.3	I also trod them in My anger
ISA.63.3	And trampled them in My wrath;
ISA.63.3	And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments,
ISA.63.3	And I stained all My raiment.
ISA.63.4	For the day of vengeance was in My heart,
ISA.63.4	And My year of redemption has come.
ISA.63.5	I looked, and there was no one to help,
ISA.63.5	And I was astonished and there was no one to uphold;
ISA.63.5	So My own arm brought salvation to Me,
ISA.63.5	And My wrath upheld Me.
ISA.63.6	I trod down the peoples in My anger
ISA.63.6	And made them drunk in My wrath,
ISA.63.6	And I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.”
ISA.63.7	I shall make mention of the lovingkindnesses of the L
ISA.63.7	According to all that the L
ISA.63.7	And the great goodness toward the house of Israel,
ISA.63.7	Which He has granted them according to His compassion
ISA.63.7	And according to the abundance of His lovingkindnesses.
ISA.63.8	For He said, “Surely, they are My people,
ISA.63.8	Sons who will not deal falsely.”
ISA.63.8	So He became their Savior.
ISA.63.9	In all their affliction He was afflicted,
ISA.63.9	And the angel of His presence saved them;
ISA.63.9	In His love and in His mercy He redeemed them,
ISA.63.9	And He lifted them and carried them all the days of old.
ISA.63.10	But they rebelled
ISA.63.10	And grieved His Holy Spirit;
ISA.63.10	Therefore He turned Himself to become their enemy,
ISA.63.10	He fought against them.
ISA.63.11	Then His people remembered the days of old, of Moses.
ISA.63.11	Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of His flock?
ISA.63.11	Where is He who put His Holy Spirit in the midst of them,
ISA.63.12	Who caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses,
ISA.63.12	Who divided the waters before them to make for Himself an everlasting name,
ISA.63.13	Who led them through the depths?
ISA.63.13	Like the horse in the wilderness, they did not stumble;
ISA.63.14	As the cattle which go down into the valley,
ISA.63.14	The Spirit of the L
ISA.63.14	So You led Your people,
ISA.63.14	To make for Yourself a glorious name.
ISA.63.15	Look down from heaven and see from Your holy and glorious habitation;
ISA.63.15	Where are Your zeal and Your mighty deeds?
ISA.63.15	The stirrings of Your heart and Your compassion are restrained toward me.
ISA.63.16	For You are our Father, though Abraham does not know us
ISA.63.16	And Israel does not recognize us.
ISA.63.16	You, O L
ISA.63.16	Our Redeemer from of old is Your name.
ISA.63.17	Why, O L
ISA.63.17	And harden our heart from fearing You?
ISA.63.17	Return for the sake of Your servants, the tribes of Your heritage.
ISA.63.18	Your holy people possessed Your sanctuary for a little while,
ISA.63.18	Our adversaries have trodden 
ISA.63.19	We have become 
ISA.64.1	Oh, that You would rend the heavens 
ISA.64.1	That the mountains might quake at Your presence—
ISA.64.2	As fire kindles the brushwood, 
ISA.64.2	To make Your name known to Your adversaries,
ISA.64.3	When You did awesome things which we did not expect,
ISA.64.3	You came down, the mountains quaked at Your presence.
ISA.64.4	For from days of old they have not heard or perceived by ear,
ISA.64.4	Nor has the eye seen a God besides You,
ISA.64.4	Who acts in behalf of the one who waits for Him.
ISA.64.5	You meet him who rejoices in doing righteousness,
ISA.64.5	Who remembers You in Your ways.
ISA.64.5	Behold, You were angry, for we sinned,
ISA.64.5	And shall we be saved?
ISA.64.6	For all of us have become like one who is unclean,
ISA.64.6	And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment;
ISA.64.6	And all of us wither like a leaf,
ISA.64.6	And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
ISA.64.7	There is no one who calls on Your name,
ISA.64.7	Who arouses himself to take hold of You;
ISA.64.7	For You have hidden Your face from us
ISA.64.7	And have delivered us into the power of our iniquities.
ISA.64.8	But now, O L
ISA.64.8	We are the clay, and You our potter;
ISA.64.8	And all of us are the work of Your hand.
ISA.64.9	Do not be angry beyond measure, O L
ISA.64.9	Nor remember iniquity forever;
ISA.64.9	Behold, look now, all of us are Your people.
ISA.64.10	Your holy cities have become a wilderness,
ISA.64.10	Zion has become a wilderness,
ISA.64.10	Jerusalem a desolation.
ISA.64.11	Our holy and beautiful house,
ISA.64.11	Where our fathers praised You,
ISA.64.11	Has been burned 
ISA.64.11	And all our precious things have become a ruin.
ISA.64.12	Will You restrain Yourself at these things, O L
ISA.64.12	Will You keep silent and afflict us beyond measure?
ISA.65.1	“I permitted Myself to be sought by those who did not ask 
ISA.65.1	I permitted Myself to be found by those who did not seek Me.
ISA.65.1	I said, ‘Here am I, here am I,’
ISA.65.1	To a nation which did not call on My name.
ISA.65.2	I have spread out My hands all day long to a rebellious people,
ISA.65.2	Who walk 
ISA.65.3	A people who continually provoke Me to My face,
ISA.65.3	Offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on bricks;
ISA.65.4	Who sit among graves and spend the night in secret places;
ISA.65.4	Who eat swine’s flesh,
ISA.65.4	And the broth of unclean meat is 
ISA.65.5	Who say, ‘Keep to yourself, do not come near me,
ISA.65.5	For I am holier than you!’
ISA.65.5	These are smoke in My nostrils,
ISA.65.5	A fire that burns all the day.
ISA.65.6	Behold, it is written before Me,
ISA.65.6	I will not keep silent, but I will repay;
ISA.65.6	I will even repay into their bosom,
ISA.65.7	Both their own iniquities and the iniquities of their fathers together,” says the L
ISA.65.7	“Because they have burned incense on the mountains
ISA.65.7	And scorned Me on the hills,
ISA.65.7	Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom.”
ISA.65.8	Thus says the L
ISA.65.8	“As the new wine is found in the cluster,
ISA.65.8	And one says, ‘Do not destroy it, for there is benefit in it,’
ISA.65.8	So I will act on behalf of My servants
ISA.65.8	In order not to destroy all of them.
ISA.65.9	I will bring forth offspring from Jacob,
ISA.65.9	And an heir of My mountains from Judah;
ISA.65.9	Even My chosen ones shall inherit it,
ISA.65.9	And My servants will dwell there.
ISA.65.10	Sharon will be a pasture land for flocks,
ISA.65.10	And the valley of Achor a resting place for herds,
ISA.65.10	For My people who seek Me.
ISA.65.11	But you who forsake the L
ISA.65.11	Who forget My holy mountain,
ISA.65.11	Who set a table for Fortune,
ISA.65.11	And who fill 
ISA.65.12	I will destine you for the sword,
ISA.65.12	And all of you will bow down to the slaughter.
ISA.65.12	Because I called, but you did not answer;
ISA.65.12	I spoke, but you did not hear.
ISA.65.12	And you did evil in My sight
ISA.65.12	And chose that in which I did not delight.”
ISA.65.13	Therefore, thus says the Lord G
ISA.65.13	“Behold, My servants will eat, but you will be hungry.
ISA.65.13	Behold, My servants will drink, but you will be thirsty.
ISA.65.13	Behold, My servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.
ISA.65.14	Behold, My servants will shout joyfully with a glad heart,
ISA.65.14	But you will cry out with a heavy heart,
ISA.65.14	And you will wail with a broken spirit.
ISA.65.15	You will leave your name for a curse to My chosen ones,
ISA.65.15	And the Lord G
ISA.65.15	But My servants will be called by another name.
ISA.65.16	Because he who is blessed in the earth
ISA.65.16	Will be blessed by the God of truth;
ISA.65.16	And he who swears in the earth
ISA.65.16	Will swear by the God of truth;
ISA.65.16	Because the former troubles are forgotten,
ISA.65.16	And because they are hidden from My sight!
ISA.65.17	“For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth;
ISA.65.17	And the former things will not be remembered or come to mind.
ISA.65.18	But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create;
ISA.65.18	For behold, I create Jerusalem 
ISA.65.18	And her people 
ISA.65.19	I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people;
ISA.65.19	And there will no longer be heard in her
ISA.65.19	The voice of weeping and the sound of crying.
ISA.65.20	No longer will there be in it an infant 
ISA.65.20	Or an old man who does not live out his days;
ISA.65.20	For the youth will die at the age of one hundred
ISA.65.20	And the one who does not reach the age of one hundred
ISA.65.20	Will be

ISA.65.21	They will also plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
ISA.65.22	They will not build and another inhabit,
ISA.65.22	They will not plant and another eat;
ISA.65.22	For as the lifetime of a tree, 
ISA.65.22	And My chosen ones will wear out the work of their hands.
ISA.65.23	They will not labor in vain,
ISA.65.23	Or bear 
ISA.65.23	For they are the offspring of those blessed by the L
ISA.65.23	And their descendants with them.
ISA.65.24	It will also come to pass that before they call, I will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear. 
ISA.65.25	The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the serpent’s food. They will do no evil or harm in all My holy mountain,” says the L
ISA.66.1	Thus says the L
ISA.66.1	“Heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool.
ISA.66.1	Where then is a house you could build for Me?
ISA.66.1	And where is a place that I may rest?
ISA.66.2	For My hand made all these things,
ISA.66.2	Thus all these things came into being,” declares the L
ISA.66.2	“But to this one I will look,
ISA.66.2	To him who is humble and contrite of spirit, and who trembles at My word.
ISA.66.3	“
ISA.66.3	He who sacrifices a lamb is 
ISA.66.3	He who offers a grain offering 
ISA.66.3	He who burns incense is 
ISA.66.3	As they have chosen their 
ISA.66.3	And their soul delights in their abominations,
ISA.66.4	So I will choose their punishments
ISA.66.4	And will bring on them what they dread.
ISA.66.4	Because I called, but no one answered;
ISA.66.4	I spoke, but they did not listen.
ISA.66.4	And they did evil in My sight
ISA.66.4	And chose that in which I did not delight.”
ISA.66.5	Hear the word of the L
ISA.66.5	“Your brothers who hate you, who exclude you for My name’s sake,
ISA.66.5	Have said, ‘Let the L
ISA.66.5	But they will be put to shame.
ISA.66.6	A voice of uproar from the city, a voice from the temple,
ISA.66.6	The voice of the L

ISA.66.7	Before her pain came, she gave birth to a boy.
ISA.66.8	Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things?
ISA.66.8	Can a land be born in one day?
ISA.66.8	Can a nation be brought forth all at once?
ISA.66.8	As soon as Zion travailed, she also brought forth her sons.
ISA.66.9	Shall I bring to the point of birth and not give delivery?” says the L
ISA.66.9	“Or shall I who gives delivery shut 
ISA.66.10	“Be joyful with Jerusalem and rejoice for her, all you who love her;
ISA.66.10	Be exceedingly glad with her, all you who mourn over her,
ISA.66.11	That you may nurse and be satisfied with her comforting breasts,
ISA.66.11	That you may suck and be delighted with her bountiful bosom.”
ISA.66.12	For thus says the L
ISA.66.12	And the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream;
ISA.66.12	And you will be nursed, you will be carried on the hip and fondled on the knees.
ISA.66.13	As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you;
ISA.66.13	And you will be comforted in Jerusalem.”
ISA.66.14	Then you will see 
ISA.66.14	And your bones will flourish like the new grass;
ISA.66.14	And the hand of the L
ISA.66.14	But He will be indignant toward His enemies.
ISA.66.15	For behold, the L
ISA.66.15	And His chariots like the whirlwind,
ISA.66.15	To render His anger with fury,
ISA.66.15	And His rebuke with flames of fire.
ISA.66.16	For the L

ISA.66.18	“For I know their works and their thoughts; the time is coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and see My glory. 
ISA.66.19	I will set a sign among them and will send survivors from them to the nations: Tarshish, Put, Lud, Meshech, Tubal and Javan, to the distant coastlands that have neither heard My fame nor seen My glory. And they will declare My glory among the nations. 
ISA.66.20	Then they shall bring all your brethren from all the nations as a grain offering to the L
ISA.66.21	I will also take some of them for priests 
ISA.66.22	“For just as the new heavens and the new earth
ISA.66.22	Which I make will endure before Me,” declares the L
ISA.66.22	“So your offspring and your name will endure.
ISA.66.23	And it shall be from new moon to new moon
ISA.66.23	And from sabbath to sabbath,
ISA.66.23	All mankind will come to bow down before Me,” says the L
ISA.66.24	“Then they will go forth and look
ISA.66.24	On the corpses of the men
ISA.66.24	Who have transgressed against Me.
ISA.66.24	For their worm will not die

JER.1.17	Now, gird up your loins and arise, and speak to them all which I command you. Do not be dismayed before them, or I will dismay you before them.

JER.2.27	And not 
JER.2.27	But in the time of their trouble they will say,
JER.2.27	‘Arise and save us.’
JER.2.28	But where are your gods
JER.2.28	Which you made for yourself?
JER.2.28	Let them arise, if they can save you
JER.2.28	In the time of your trouble;
JER.2.28	For 
JER.2.28	Are your gods, O Judah.
JER.2.29	“Why do you contend with Me?
JER.2.29	You have all transgressed against Me,” declares the L
JER.2.30	“In vain I have struck your sons;
JER.2.30	They accepted no chastening.
JER.2.30	Your sword has devoured your prophets
JER.2.30	Like a destroying lion.
JER.2.31	O generation, heed the word of the L
JER.2.31	Have I been a wilderness to Israel,
JER.2.31	Or a land of thick darkness?
JER.2.31	Why do My people say, ‘We 
JER.2.31	We will no longer come to You’?
JER.2.32	Can a virgin forget her ornaments,
JER.2.32	Or a bride her attire?
JER.2.32	Yet My people have forgotten Me
JER.2.32	Days without number.
JER.2.33	How well you prepare your way
JER.2.33	To seek love!
JER.2.33	Therefore even the wicked women
JER.2.33	You have taught your ways.
JER.2.34	Also on your skirts is found
JER.2.34	The lifeblood of the innocent poor;
JER.2.34	You did not find them breaking in.
JER.2.34	But in spite of all these things,
JER.2.35	Yet you said, ‘I am innocent;
JER.2.35	Surely His anger is turned away from me.’
JER.2.35	Behold, I will enter into judgment with you
JER.2.35	Because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’
JER.2.36	Why do you go around so much
JER.2.36	Changing your way?
JER.2.36	Also, you will be put to shame by Egypt
JER.2.36	As you were put to shame by Assyria.
JER.2.37	From this 
JER.2.37	With your hands on your head;
JER.2.37	For the L
JER.2.37	And you will not prosper with them.”
JER.3.1	And she goes from him
JER.3.1	And belongs to another man,
JER.3.1	Will he still return to her?
JER.3.1	Will not that land be completely polluted?
JER.3.1	But you are a harlot 
JER.3.1	Yet you turn to Me,” declares the L
JER.3.2	“Lift up your eyes to the bare heights and see;
JER.3.2	Where have you not been violated?
JER.3.2	By the roads you have sat for them
JER.3.2	Like an Arab in the desert,
JER.3.2	And you have polluted a land
JER.3.2	With your harlotry and with your wickedness.
JER.3.3	Therefore the showers have been withheld,
JER.3.3	And there has been no spring rain.
JER.3.3	Yet you had a harlot’s forehead;
JER.3.3	You refused to be ashamed.
JER.3.4	Have you not just now called to Me,
JER.3.4	‘My Father, You are the friend of my youth?
JER.3.5	Will He be angry forever?
JER.3.5	Will He be indignant to the end?’
JER.3.5	Behold, you have spoken
JER.3.5	And have done evil things,
JER.3.5	And you have had your way.”
JER.3.6	Then the L
JER.3.7	I thought, ‘After she has done all these things she will return to Me’; but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. 
JER.3.8	And I saw that for all the adulteries of faithless Israel, I had sent her away and given her a writ of divorce, yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear; but she went and was a harlot also. 
JER.3.9	Because of the lightness of her harlotry, she polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and trees. 
JER.3.10	Yet in spite of all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to Me with all her heart, but rather in deception,” declares the L
JER.3.11	And the L

JER.3.12	‘Return, faithless Israel,’ declares the L
JER.3.12	‘I will not look upon you in anger.
JER.3.12	For I am gracious,’ declares the L
JER.3.12	‘I will not be angry forever.
JER.3.13	Only acknowledge your iniquity,
JER.3.13	That you have transgressed against the L

JER.3.13	And you have not obeyed My voice,’ declares the L
JER.3.14	‘Return, O faithless sons,’ declares the L
JER.3.14	‘For I am a master to you,
JER.3.14	And I will take you one from a city and two from a family,
JER.3.14	And I will bring you to Zion.’
JER.3.15	“Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart, who will feed you on knowledge and understanding. 
JER.3.16	It shall be in those days when you are multiplied and increased in the land,” declares the L
JER.3.17	At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘The Throne of the L
JER.3.18	In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers as an inheritance.
JER.3.19	“Then I said,
JER.3.19	‘How I would set you among My sons
JER.3.19	And give you a pleasant land,
JER.3.19	The most beautiful inheritance of the nations!’
JER.3.19	And I said, ‘You shall call Me, My Father,
JER.3.19	And not turn away from following Me.’
JER.3.20	Surely, as a woman treacherously departs from her lover,
JER.3.20	So you have dealt treacherously with Me,
JER.3.20	O house of Israel,” declares the L
JER.3.21	A voice is heard on the bare heights,
JER.3.21	The weeping 
JER.3.21	Because they have perverted their way,
JER.3.21	They have forgotten the L

JER.3.22	I will heal your faithlessness.”
JER.3.22	“Behold, we come to You;

JER.3.23	A tumult 
JER.3.23	Surely in the L

JER.3.24	“But the shameful thing has consumed the labor of our fathers since our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 
JER.3.25	Let us lie down in our shame, and let our humiliation cover us; for we have sinned against the L
JER.4.1	“If you will return, O Israel,” declares the L
JER.4.1	“
JER.4.1	And if you will put away your detested things from My presence,
JER.4.1	And will not waver,
JER.4.2	And you will swear, ‘As the L

JER.4.2	Then the nations will bless themselves in Him,
JER.4.2	And in Him they will glory.”
JER.4.3	For thus says the L
JER.4.3	“Break up your fallow ground,
JER.4.3	And do not sow among thorns.
JER.4.4	Circumcise yourselves to the L
JER.4.4	And remove the foreskins of your heart,
JER.4.4	Men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem,
JER.4.4	Or else My wrath will go forth like fire
JER.4.4	And burn with none to quench it,
JER.4.4	Because of the evil of your deeds.”
JER.4.5	Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say,
JER.4.5	“Blow the trumpet in the land;
JER.4.5	Cry aloud and say,
JER.4.5	‘Assemble yourselves, and let us go
JER.4.5	Into the fortified cities.’
JER.4.6	Lift up a standard toward Zion!
JER.4.6	Seek refuge, do not stand 
JER.4.6	For I am bringing evil from the north,
JER.4.6	And great destruction.
JER.4.7	A lion has gone up from his thicket,
JER.4.7	And a destroyer of nations has set out;
JER.4.7	He has gone out from his place
JER.4.7	To make your land a waste.
JER.4.7	Your cities will be ruins
JER.4.7	Without inhabitant.
JER.4.8	For this, put on sackcloth,
JER.4.8	Lament and wail;
JER.4.8	For the fierce anger of the L
JER.4.8	Has not turned back from us.”
JER.4.9	“It shall come about in that day,” declares the L
JER.4.10	Then I said, “Ah, Lord G
JER.4.11	In that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A scorching wind from the bare heights in the wilderness in the direction of the daughter of My people—not to winnow and not to cleanse, 
JER.4.12	a wind too strong for this—will come at My command; now I will also pronounce judgments against them.
JER.4.13	Behold, he goes up like clouds,
JER.4.13	And his chariots like the whirlwind;
JER.4.13	His horses are swifter than eagles.
JER.4.13	Woe to us, for we are ruined!”
JER.4.14	Wash your heart from evil, O Jerusalem,
JER.4.14	That you may be saved.
JER.4.14	How long will your wicked thoughts
JER.4.14	Lodge within you?
JER.4.15	For a voice declares from Dan,
JER.4.15	And proclaims wickedness from Mount Ephraim.
JER.4.16	“Report 
JER.4.16	Proclaim over Jerusalem,
JER.4.16	‘Besiegers come from a far country,
JER.4.16	And lift their voices against the cities of Judah.
JER.4.17	Like watchmen of a field they are against her round about,
JER.4.17	Because she has rebelled against Me,’ declares the L
JER.4.18	Your ways and your deeds
JER.4.18	Have brought these things to you.
JER.4.18	This is your evil. How bitter!
JER.4.18	How it has touched your heart!”
JER.4.19	My soul, my soul! I am in anguish! Oh, my heart!
JER.4.19	My heart is pounding in me;
JER.4.19	I cannot be silent,
JER.4.19	Because you have heard, O my soul,
JER.4.19	The sound of the trumpet,
JER.4.19	The alarm of war.
JER.4.20	Disaster on disaster is proclaimed,
JER.4.20	For the whole land is devastated;
JER.4.20	Suddenly my tents are devastated,
JER.4.20	My curtains in an instant.
JER.4.21	How long must I see the standard
JER.4.21	And hear the sound of the trumpet?
JER.4.22	“For My people are foolish,
JER.4.22	They know Me not;
JER.4.22	They are stupid children
JER.4.22	And have no understanding.
JER.4.22	They are shrewd to do evil,
JER.4.22	But to do good they do not know.”
JER.4.23	I looked on the earth, and behold, 
JER.4.23	And to the heavens, and they had no light.
JER.4.24	I looked on the mountains, and behold, they were quaking,
JER.4.24	And all the hills moved to and fro.
JER.4.25	I looked, and behold, there was no man,
JER.4.25	And all the birds of the heavens had fled.
JER.4.26	I looked, and behold, the fruitful land was a wilderness,
JER.4.26	And all its cities were pulled down
JER.4.26	Before the L
JER.4.27	For thus says the L
JER.4.27	“The whole land shall be a desolation,
JER.4.27	Yet I will not execute a complete destruction.
JER.4.28	For this the earth shall mourn
JER.4.28	And the heavens above be dark,
JER.4.28	Because I have spoken, I have purposed,
JER.4.28	And I will not change My mind, nor will I turn from it.”
JER.4.29	At the sound of the horseman and bowman every city flees;
JER.4.29	They go into the thickets and climb among the rocks;
JER.4.29	Every city is forsaken,
JER.4.29	And no man dwells in them.
JER.4.30	And you, O desolate one, what will you do?
JER.4.30	Although you dress in scarlet,
JER.4.30	Although you decorate 
JER.4.30	Although you enlarge your eyes with paint,
JER.4.30	In vain you make yourself beautiful.
JER.4.30	They seek your life.
JER.4.31	For I heard a cry as of a woman in labor,
JER.4.31	The anguish as of one giving birth to her first child,
JER.4.31	The cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath,
JER.4.31	Stretching out her hands, 
JER.4.31	“Ah, woe is me, for I faint before murderers.”
JER.5.1	“Roam to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem,
JER.5.1	And look now and take note.
JER.5.1	And seek in her open squares,
JER.5.1	If you can find a man,
JER.5.1	If there is one who does justice, who seeks truth,
JER.5.1	Then I will pardon her.
JER.5.2	And although they say, ‘As the L
JER.5.2	Surely they swear falsely.”
JER.5.3	O L
JER.5.3	You have smitten them,
JER.5.3	You have consumed them,
JER.5.3	But they refused to take correction.
JER.5.3	They have made their faces harder than rock;
JER.5.3	They have refused to repent.
JER.5.4	Then I said, “They are only the poor,
JER.5.4	They are foolish;
JER.5.4	For they do not know the way of the L
JER.5.5	I will go to the great
JER.5.5	And will speak to them,
JER.5.5	For they know the way of the L
JER.5.5	But they too, with one accord, have broken the yoke
JER.5.6	Therefore a lion from the forest will slay them,
JER.5.6	A wolf of the deserts will destroy them,
JER.5.6	A leopard is watching their cities.
JER.5.6	Everyone who goes out of them will be torn in pieces,
JER.5.6	Because their transgressions are many,
JER.5.6	Their apostasies are numerous.
JER.5.7	“Why should I pardon you?
JER.5.7	Your sons have forsaken Me
JER.5.7	And sworn by those who are not gods.
JER.5.7	When I had fed them to the full,
JER.5.7	They committed adultery
JER.5.7	And trooped to the harlot’s house.
JER.5.8	They were well-fed lusty horses,
JER.5.8	Each one neighing after his neighbor’s wife.
JER.5.9	Shall I not punish these 
JER.5.9	“And on a nation such as this
JER.5.9	Shall I not avenge Myself?
JER.5.10	“Go up through her vine rows and destroy,
JER.5.10	But do not execute a complete destruction;
JER.5.10	Strip away her branches,
JER.5.10	For they are not the L
JER.5.11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah
JER.5.11	Have dealt very treacherously with Me,” declares the L
JER.5.12	They have lied about the L
JER.5.12	And said, “
JER.5.12	Misfortune will not come on us,
JER.5.12	And we will not see sword or famine.
JER.5.13	The prophets are 
JER.5.13	And the word is not in them.
JER.5.13	Thus it will be done to them!”
JER.5.14	Therefore, thus says the L
JER.5.14	“Because you have spoken this word,
JER.5.14	Behold, I am making My words in your mouth fire
JER.5.14	And this people wood, and it will consume them.
JER.5.15	Behold, I am bringing a nation against you from afar, O house of Israel,” declares the L
JER.5.15	“It is an enduring nation,
JER.5.15	It is an ancient nation,
JER.5.15	A nation whose language you do not know,
JER.5.15	Nor can you understand what they say.
JER.5.16	Their quiver is like an open grave,
JER.5.16	All of them are mighty men.
JER.5.17	They will devour your harvest and your food;
JER.5.17	They will devour your sons and your daughters;
JER.5.17	They will devour your flocks and your herds;
JER.5.17	They will devour your vines and your fig trees;
JER.5.17	They will demolish with the sword your fortified cities in which you trust.
JER.5.18	“Yet even in those days,” declares the L
JER.5.19	It shall come about when they say, ‘Why has the L
JER.5.20	“Declare this in the house of Jacob
JER.5.20	And proclaim it in Judah, saying,
JER.5.21	‘Now hear this, O foolish and senseless people,
JER.5.21	Who have eyes but do not see;
JER.5.21	Who have ears but do not hear.
JER.5.22	Do you not fear Me?’ declares the L
JER.5.22	‘Do you not tremble in My presence?
JER.5.22	For I have placed the sand as a boundary for the sea,
JER.5.22	An eternal decree, so it cannot cross over it.
JER.5.22	Though the waves toss, yet they cannot prevail;
JER.5.22	Though they roar, yet they cannot cross over it.
JER.5.23	But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart;
JER.5.23	They have turned aside and departed.
JER.5.24	They do not say in their heart,
JER.5.24	“Let us now fear the L
JER.5.24	Who gives rain in its season,
JER.5.24	Both the autumn rain and the spring rain,
JER.5.24	Who keeps for us
JER.5.24	The appointed weeks of the harvest.”
JER.5.25	Your iniquities have turned these away,
JER.5.25	And your sins have withheld good from you.
JER.5.26	For wicked men are found among My people,
JER.5.26	They watch like fowlers lying in wait;
JER.5.26	They set a trap,
JER.5.26	They catch men.
JER.5.27	Like a cage full of birds,
JER.5.27	So their houses are full of deceit;
JER.5.27	Therefore they have become great and rich.
JER.5.28	They are fat, they are sleek,
JER.5.28	They also 
JER.5.28	They do not plead the cause,
JER.5.28	The cause of the orphan, that they may prosper;
JER.5.28	And they do not defend the rights of the poor.
JER.5.29	Shall I not punish these 
JER.5.29	‘On a nation such as this
JER.5.29	Shall I not avenge Myself?’
JER.5.30	“An appalling and horrible thing
JER.5.30	Has happened in the land:
JER.5.31	The prophets prophesy falsely,
JER.5.31	And the priests rule on their

JER.5.31	But what will you do at the end of it?
JER.6.1	“Flee for safety, O sons of Benjamin,
JER.6.1	From the midst of Jerusalem!
JER.6.1	Now blow a trumpet in Tekoa
JER.6.1	And raise a signal over

JER.6.1	And a great destruction.
JER.6.2	The comely and dainty one, the daughter of Zion, I will cut off.
JER.6.3	Shepherds and their flocks will come to her,

JER.6.3	They will pasture each in his place.

JER.6.4	Woe to us, for the day declines,
JER.6.4	For the shadows of the evening lengthen!
JER.6.5	Arise, and let us attack by night
JER.6.5	And destroy her palaces!”
JER.6.6	For thus says the L
JER.6.6	“Cut down her trees
JER.6.6	And cast up a siege against Jerusalem.
JER.6.6	This is the city to be punished,
JER.6.6	In whose midst there is only oppression.
JER.6.7	As a well keeps its waters fresh,
JER.6.7	So she keeps fresh her wickedness.
JER.6.7	Violence and destruction are heard in her;
JER.6.7	Sickness and wounds are ever before Me.
JER.6.8	Be warned, O Jerusalem,
JER.6.8	Or I shall be alienated from you,
JER.6.8	And make you a desolation,
JER.6.8	A land not inhabited.”
JER.6.9	Thus says the L
JER.6.9	“They will thoroughly glean as the vine the remnant of Israel;
JER.6.9	Pass your hand again like a grape gatherer
JER.6.9	Over the branches.”
JER.6.10	To whom shall I speak and give warning
JER.6.10	That they may hear?
JER.6.10	Behold, their ears are closed
JER.6.10	And they cannot listen.
JER.6.10	Behold, the word of the L
JER.6.10	They have no delight in it.
JER.6.11	But I am full of the wrath of the L
JER.6.11	I am weary with holding 
JER.6.11	“Pour 
JER.6.11	And on the gathering of young men together;

JER.6.11	The aged and the very old.
JER.6.12	Their houses shall be turned over to others,
JER.6.12	Their fields and their wives together;

JER.6.13	“For from the least of them even to the greatest of them,
JER.6.13	Everyone is greedy for gain,
JER.6.13	And from the prophet even to the priest
JER.6.13	Everyone deals falsely.
JER.6.14	They have healed the brokenness of My people superficially,
JER.6.14	Saying, ‘Peace, peace,’
JER.6.14	But there is no peace.
JER.6.15	Were they ashamed because of the abomination they have done?
JER.6.15	They were not even ashamed at all;
JER.6.15	They did not even know how to blush.
JER.6.15	Therefore they shall fall among those who fall;
JER.6.15	At the time that I punish them,
JER.6.15	They shall be cast down,” says the L
JER.6.16	Thus says the L
JER.6.16	“Stand by the ways and see and ask for the ancient paths,
JER.6.16	Where the good way is, and walk in it;
JER.6.16	And you will find rest for your souls.
JER.6.16	But they said, ‘We will not walk 
JER.6.17	And I set watchmen over you, 
JER.6.17	‘Listen to the sound of the trumpet!’
JER.6.17	But they said, ‘We will not listen.’
JER.6.18	Therefore hear, O nations,
JER.6.18	And know, O congregation, what is among them.
JER.6.19	Hear, O earth: behold, I am bringing disaster on this people,
JER.6.19	The fruit of their plans,
JER.6.19	Because they have not listened to My words,
JER.6.19	And as for My law, they have rejected it also.
JER.6.20	For what purpose does frankincense come to Me from Sheba
JER.6.20	And the sweet cane from a distant land?
JER.6.20	Your burnt offerings are not acceptable
JER.6.20	And your sacrifices are not pleasing to Me.”
JER.6.21	Therefore, thus says the L
JER.6.21	“Behold, I am laying stumbling blocks before this people.
JER.6.21	And they will stumble against them,
JER.6.21	Fathers and sons together;
JER.6.21	Neighbor and friend will perish.”
JER.6.22	Thus says the L
JER.6.22	“Behold, a people is coming from the north land,
JER.6.22	And a great nation will be aroused from the remote parts of the earth.
JER.6.23	They seize bow and spear;
JER.6.23	They are cruel and have no mercy;
JER.6.23	Their voice roars like the sea,
JER.6.23	And they ride on horses,
JER.6.23	Arrayed as a man for the battle
JER.6.23	Against you, O daughter of Zion!”
JER.6.24	We have heard the report of it;
JER.6.24	Our hands are limp.
JER.6.24	Anguish has seized us,
JER.6.24	Pain as of a woman in childbirth.
JER.6.25	Do not go out into the field
JER.6.25	And do not walk on the road,
JER.6.25	For the enemy has a sword,
JER.6.25	Terror is on every side.
JER.6.26	O daughter of my people, put on sackcloth
JER.6.26	And roll in ashes;
JER.6.26	Mourn as for an only son,
JER.6.26	A lamentation most bitter.
JER.6.26	For suddenly the destroyer
JER.6.26	Will come upon us.
JER.6.27	“I have made you an assayer 
JER.6.27	That you may know and assay their way.”
JER.6.28	All of them are stubbornly rebellious,
JER.6.28	Going about as a talebearer.
JER.6.28	They, all of them, are corrupt.
JER.6.29	The bellows blow fiercely,
JER.6.29	The lead is consumed by the fire;
JER.6.29	In vain the refining goes on,
JER.6.29	But the wicked are not separated.
JER.6.30	They call them rejected silver,
JER.6.30	Because the L
JER.7.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the L

JER.7.12	“But go now to My place which was in Shiloh, where I made My name dwell at the first, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel. 
JER.7.13	And now, because you have done all these things,” declares the L
JER.7.14	therefore, I will do to the house which is called by My name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave you and your fathers, as I did to Shiloh. 
JER.7.15	I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, all the offspring of Ephraim.
JER.7.16	“As for you, do not pray for this people, and do not lift up cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with Me; for I do not hear you. 
JER.7.17	Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and 
JER.7.19	Do they spite Me?” declares the L
JER.7.20	Therefore thus says the Lord G
JER.7.21	Thus says the L
JER.7.22	For I did not speak to your fathers, or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices. 
JER.7.23	But this is what I commanded them, saying, ‘Obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you will be My people; and you will walk in all the way which I command you, that it may be well with you.’ 
JER.7.24	Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in 
JER.7.25	Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent you all My servants the prophets, daily rising early and sending 
JER.7.26	Yet they did not listen to Me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck; they did more evil than their fathers.
JER.7.27	“You shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you; and you shall call to them, but they will not answer you. 
JER.7.28	You shall say to them, ‘This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the L
JER.7.29	Cut off your hair and cast 
JER.7.29	And take up a lamentation on the bare heights;
JER.7.29	For the L
JER.7.29	The generation of His wrath.’
JER.7.30	For the sons of Judah have done that which is evil in My sight,” declares the L
JER.7.31	They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, and it did not come into My mind.
JER.7.32	“Therefore, behold, days are coming,” declares the L
JER.7.33	The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth; and no one will frighten 
JER.7.34	Then I will make to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a ruin.
JER.8.1	“At that time,” declares the L
JER.8.2	They will spread them out to the sun, the moon and to all the host of heaven, which they have loved and which they have served, and which they have gone after and which they have sought, and which they have worshiped. They will not be gathered or buried; they will be as dung on the face of the ground. 
JER.8.3	And death will be chosen rather than life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family, that remains in all the places to which I have driven them,” declares the L
JER.8.4	“You shall say to them, ‘Thus says the L

JER.8.5	Why then has this people, Jerusalem,

JER.8.5	They hold fast to deceit,
JER.8.5	They refuse to return.
JER.8.6	I have listened and heard,
JER.8.6	They have spoken what is not right;
JER.8.6	No man repented of his wickedness,
JER.8.6	Saying, ‘What have I done?’
JER.8.6	Everyone turned to his course,
JER.8.6	Like a horse charging into the battle.
JER.8.7	Even the stork in the sky
JER.8.7	Knows her seasons;
JER.8.7	And the turtledove and the swift and the thrush
JER.8.7	Observe the time of their migration;
JER.8.7	But My people do not know
JER.8.7	The ordinance of the L

JER.8.10	Therefore I will give their wives to others,
JER.8.10	Their fields to new owners;
JER.8.10	Because from the least even to the greatest
JER.8.10	Everyone is greedy for gain;

JER.8.10	Everyone practices deceit.
JER.8.11	They heal the brokenness of the daughter of My people superficially,
JER.8.11	Saying, ‘Peace, peace,’
JER.8.11	But there is no peace.
JER.8.12	Were they ashamed because of the abomination they had done?
JER.8.12	They certainly were not ashamed,
JER.8.12	And they did not know how to blush;
JER.8.12	Therefore they shall fall among those who fall;
JER.8.12	At the time of their punishment they shall be brought down,”
JER.8.12	Says the L

JER.8.13	And no figs on the fig tree,

JER.8.14	Why are we sitting still?
JER.8.14	Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities
JER.8.14	And let us perish there,

JER.8.16	From Dan is heard the snorting of his horses;
JER.8.16	At the sound of the neighing of his stallions
JER.8.16	The whole land quakes;
JER.8.16	For they come and devour the land and its fullness,
JER.8.16	The city and its inhabitants.
JER.8.17	“For behold, I am sending serpents against you,
JER.8.17	Adders, for which there is no charm,
JER.8.17	And they will bite you,” declares the L
JER.8.18	My sorrow is beyond healing,
JER.8.18	My heart is faint 
JER.8.19	Behold, listen! The cry of the daughter of my people from a distant land:
JER.8.19	“Is the L
JER.8.19	“Why have they provoked Me with their graven images, with foreign idols?”
JER.8.20	“Harvest is past, summer is ended,
JER.8.20	And we are not saved.”
JER.8.21	For the brokenness of the daughter of my people I am broken;
JER.8.21	I mourn, dismay has taken hold of me.
JER.8.22	Is there no balm in Gilead?
JER.8.22	Is there no physician there?
JER.8.22	Why then has not the health of the daughter of my people been restored?
JER.9.1	Oh that my head were waters
JER.9.1	And my eyes a fountain of tears,
JER.9.1	That I might weep day and night
JER.9.1	For the slain of the daughter of my people!
JER.9.2	Oh that I had in the desert
JER.9.2	A wayfarers’ lodging place;
JER.9.2	That I might leave my people
JER.9.2	And go from them!
JER.9.2	For all of them are adulterers,
JER.9.2	An assembly of treacherous men.
JER.9.3	“They bend their tongue 
JER.9.3	Lies and not truth prevail in the land;
JER.9.3	For they proceed from evil to evil,
JER.9.3	And they do not know Me,” declares the L

JER.9.4	And do not trust any brother;
JER.9.4	Because every brother deals craftily,
JER.9.4	And every neighbor goes about as a slanderer.
JER.9.5	Everyone deceives his neighbor
JER.9.5	And does not speak the truth,
JER.9.5	They have taught their tongue to speak lies;
JER.9.5	They weary themselves committing iniquity.
JER.9.6	Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit;
JER.9.6	Through deceit they refuse to know Me,” declares the L

JER.9.8	Their tongue is a deadly arrow;
JER.9.8	It speaks deceit;

JER.9.10	“For the mountains I will take up a weeping and wailing,
JER.9.10	And for the pastures of the wilderness a dirge,

JER.9.10	And the lowing of the cattle is not heard;
JER.9.10	Both the birds of the sky and the beasts have fled; they are gone.
JER.9.11	I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins,
JER.9.11	A haunt of jackals;

JER.9.15	therefore thus says the L
JER.9.16	I will scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them until I have annihilated them.”
JER.9.17	Thus says the L
JER.9.17	“Consider and call for the mourning women, that they may come;
JER.9.17	And send for the wailing women, that they may come!
JER.9.18	Let them make haste and take up a wailing for us,
JER.9.18	That our eyes may shed tears
JER.9.18	And our eyelids flow with water.
JER.9.19	For a voice of wailing is heard from Zion,
JER.9.19	‘How are we ruined!
JER.9.19	We are put to great shame,

JER.9.19	Because they have cast down our dwellings.’ ”
JER.9.20	Now hear the word of the L
JER.9.20	And let your ear receive the word of His mouth;
JER.9.20	Teach your daughters wailing,
JER.9.20	And everyone her neighbor a dirge.
JER.9.21	For death has come up through our windows;
JER.9.21	It has entered our palaces
JER.9.21	To cut off the children from the streets,
JER.9.21	The young men from the town squares.
JER.9.22	Speak, “Thus says the L
JER.9.22	‘The corpses of men will fall like dung on the open field,
JER.9.22	And like the sheaf after the reaper,
JER.9.22	But no one will gather

JER.9.25	“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the L
JER.9.26	Egypt and Judah, and Edom and the sons of Ammon, and Moab and all those inhabiting the desert who clip the hair on their temples; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised of heart.”
JER.10.1	Hear the word which the L
JER.10.2	Thus says the L
JER.10.2	“Do not learn the way of the nations,
JER.10.2	And do not be terrified by the signs of the heavens
JER.10.2	Although the nations are terrified by them;
JER.10.3	For the customs of the peoples are delusion;
JER.10.3	Because it is wood cut from the forest,
JER.10.3	The work of the hands of a craftsman with a cutting tool.
JER.10.4	They decorate 
JER.10.4	They fasten it with nails and with hammers
JER.10.4	So that it will not totter.
JER.10.5	Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field are they,
JER.10.5	And they cannot speak;
JER.10.5	They must be carried,
JER.10.5	Because they cannot walk!
JER.10.5	Do not fear them,
JER.10.5	For they can do no harm,
JER.10.5	Nor can they do any good.”
JER.10.6	There is none like You, O L
JER.10.6	You are great, and great is Your name in might.
JER.10.7	Who would not fear You, O King of the nations?
JER.10.7	Indeed it is Your due!
JER.10.7	For among all the wise men of the nations
JER.10.7	And in all their kingdoms,
JER.10.7	There is none like You.
JER.10.8	But they are altogether stupid and foolish
JER.10.9	Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish,
JER.10.9	And gold from Uphaz,
JER.10.9	The work of a craftsman and of the hands of a goldsmith;
JER.10.9	Violet and purple are their clothing;
JER.10.9	They are all the work of skilled men.
JER.10.10	But the L
JER.10.10	He is the living God and the everlasting King.
JER.10.10	At His wrath the earth quakes,
JER.10.10	And the nations cannot endure His indignation.
JER.10.11	Thus you shall say to them, “The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.”
JER.10.12	Who established the world by His wisdom;
JER.10.12	And by His understanding He has stretched out the heavens.
JER.10.13	When He utters His voice, 
JER.10.13	And He causes the clouds to ascend from the end of the earth;
JER.10.13	He makes lightning for the rain,
JER.10.13	And brings out the wind from His storehouses.
JER.10.14	Every man is stupid, devoid of knowledge;
JER.10.14	Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols;
JER.10.14	For his molten images are deceitful,
JER.10.14	And there is no breath in them.
JER.10.15	They are worthless, a work of mockery;
JER.10.15	In the time of their punishment they will perish.
JER.10.16	The portion of Jacob is not like these;
JER.10.16	For the Maker of all is He,
JER.10.16	And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance;
JER.10.16	The L
JER.10.17	Pick up your bundle from the ground,
JER.10.17	You who dwell under siege!
JER.10.18	For thus says the L
JER.10.18	“Behold, I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land
JER.10.18	At this time,
JER.10.18	And will cause them distress,
JER.10.18	That they may be found.”
JER.10.19	Woe is me, because of my injury!
JER.10.19	My wound is incurable.
JER.10.19	But I said, “Truly this is a sickness,
JER.10.19	And I must bear it.”
JER.10.20	My tent is destroyed,
JER.10.20	And all my ropes are broken;
JER.10.20	My sons have gone from me and are no more.
JER.10.20	There is no one to stretch out my tent again
JER.10.20	Or to set up my curtains.
JER.10.21	For the shepherds have become stupid
JER.10.21	And have not sought the L
JER.10.21	Therefore they have not prospered,
JER.10.21	And all their flock is scattered.
JER.10.22	The sound of a report! Behold, it comes—
JER.10.22	A great commotion out of the land of the north—
JER.10.22	To make the cities of Judah
JER.10.22	A desolation, a haunt of jackals.
JER.10.23	I know, O L
JER.10.23	Nor is it in a man who walks to direct his steps.
JER.10.24	Correct me, O L
JER.10.24	Not with Your anger, or You will bring me to nothing.
JER.10.25	Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know You
JER.10.25	And on the families that do not call Your name;
JER.10.25	For they have devoured Jacob;
JER.10.25	They have devoured him and consumed him
JER.10.25	And have laid waste his habitation.
JER.11.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the L
JER.11.2	“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 
JER.11.3	and say to them, ‘Thus says the L
JER.11.4	which I commanded your forefathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, ‘Listen to My voice, and do according to all which I command you; so you shall be My people, and I will be your God,’ 
JER.11.5	in order to confirm the oath which I swore to your forefathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as 
JER.11.6	And the L
JER.11.7	For I solemnly warned your fathers in the day that I brought them up from the land of Egypt, even to this day, warning persistently, saying, “Listen to My voice.” 
JER.11.8	Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked, each one, in the stubbornness of his evil heart; therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded 
JER.11.9	Then the L
JER.11.10	They have turned back to the iniquities of their ancestors who refused to hear My words, and they have gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.” 
JER.11.11	Therefore thus says the L
JER.11.12	Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they surely will not save them in the time of their disaster. 
JER.11.13	For your gods are as many as your cities, O Judah; and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.
JER.11.14	“Therefore do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not listen when they call to Me because of their disaster.
JER.11.15	What right has My beloved in My house
JER.11.15	When she has done many vile deeds?
JER.11.15	Can the sacrificial flesh take away from you your disaster,
JER.11.15	So 
JER.11.16	The L
JER.11.16	“A green olive tree, beautiful in fruit and form”;
JER.11.16	With the noise of a great tumult
JER.11.16	He has kindled fire on it,
JER.11.16	And its branches are worthless.
JER.11.17	The L
JER.11.18	Moreover, the L
JER.11.18	Then You showed me their deeds.
JER.11.19	But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter;
JER.11.19	And I did not know that they had devised plots against me, 
JER.11.19	“Let us destroy the tree with its fruit,
JER.11.19	And let us cut him off from the land of the living,
JER.11.19	That his name be remembered no more.”
JER.11.20	But, O L
JER.11.20	Who tries the feelings and the heart,
JER.11.20	Let me see Your vengeance on them,
JER.11.20	For to You have I committed my cause.
JER.11.21	Therefore thus says the L
JER.11.22	therefore, thus says the L
JER.11.23	and a remnant will not be left to them, for I will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth—the year of their punishment.”
JER.12.1	Righteous are You, O L
JER.12.1	Indeed I would discuss matters of justice with You:
JER.12.1	Why has the way of the wicked prospered?
JER.12.2	You have planted them, they have also taken root;
JER.12.2	They grow, they have even produced fruit.
JER.12.2	You are near to their lips
JER.12.2	But far from their mind.
JER.12.3	But You know me, O L
JER.12.3	You see me;
JER.12.3	And You examine my heart’s 
JER.12.3	Drag them off like sheep for the slaughter
JER.12.3	And set them apart for a day of carnage!
JER.12.4	How long is the land to mourn
JER.12.4	And the vegetation of the countryside to wither?
JER.12.4	For the wickedness of those who dwell in it,
JER.12.4	Animals and birds have been snatched away,
JER.12.4	Because 
JER.12.5	“If you have run with footmen and they have tired you out,
JER.12.5	Then how can you compete with horses?
JER.12.5	If you fall down in a land of peace,
JER.12.5	How will you do in the thicket of the Jordan?
JER.12.6	For even your brothers and the household of your father,
JER.12.6	Even they have dealt treacherously with you,
JER.12.6	Even they have cried aloud after you.
JER.12.6	Do not believe them, although they may say nice things to you.”
JER.12.7	“I have forsaken My house,
JER.12.7	I have abandoned My inheritance;
JER.12.7	I have given the beloved of My soul
JER.12.7	Into the hand of her enemies.
JER.12.8	My inheritance has become to Me
JER.12.8	Like a lion in the forest;
JER.12.8	She has roared against Me;
JER.12.8	Therefore I have come to hate her.
JER.12.9	Is My inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to Me?
JER.12.9	Are the birds of prey against her on every side?
JER.12.9	Go, gather all the beasts of the field,

JER.12.10	Many shepherds have ruined My vineyard,
JER.12.10	They have trampled down My field;
JER.12.10	They have made My pleasant field
JER.12.10	A desolate wilderness.
JER.12.11	It has been made a desolation,
JER.12.11	Desolate, it mourns before Me;
JER.12.11	The whole land has been made desolate,
JER.12.11	Because no man lays it to heart.
JER.12.12	On all the bare heights in the wilderness
JER.12.12	Destroyers have come,
JER.12.12	For a sword of the L
JER.12.12	From one end of the land even to the other;
JER.12.12	There is no peace for anyone.
JER.12.13	They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns,
JER.12.13	They have strained themselves to no profit.
JER.12.13	But be ashamed of your harvest
JER.12.13	Because of the fierce anger of the L
JER.12.14	Thus says the L
JER.12.15	And it will come about that after I have uprooted them, I will again have compassion on them; and I will bring them back, each one to his inheritance and each one to his land. 
JER.12.16	Then if they will really learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, ‘As the L

JER.13.10	This wicked people, who refuse to listen to My words, who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and have gone after other gods to serve them and to bow down to them, let them be just like this waistband which is totally worthless. 
JER.13.11	For as the waistband clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole household of Israel and the whole household of Judah cling to Me,’ declares the L

JER.13.17	And flow down with tears,
JER.13.17	Because the flock of the L

JER.13.25	This is your lot, the portion measured to you
JER.13.25	From Me,” declares the L
JER.13.25	“Because you have forgotten Me
JER.13.25	And trusted in falsehood.
JER.13.26	So I Myself have also stripped your skirts off over your face,
JER.13.26	That your shame may be seen.
JER.13.27	As for your adulteries and your 
JER.13.27	The lewdness of your prostitution
JER.13.27	On the hills in the field,
JER.13.27	I have seen your abominations.
JER.13.27	Woe to you, O Jerusalem!
JER.13.27	How long will you remain unclean?”
JER.14.1	That which came as the word of the L
JER.14.2	“Judah mourns
JER.14.2	And her gates languish;
JER.14.2	They sit on the ground in mourning,
JER.14.2	And the cry of Jerusalem has ascended.
JER.14.3	Their nobles have sent their servants for water;
JER.14.3	They have come to the cisterns and found no water.
JER.14.3	They have returned with their vessels empty;
JER.14.3	They have been put to shame and humiliated,
JER.14.3	And they cover their heads.
JER.14.4	Because the ground is cracked,
JER.14.4	For there has been no rain on the land;
JER.14.4	The farmers have been put to shame,
JER.14.4	They have covered their heads.
JER.14.5	For even the doe in the field has given birth only to abandon 
JER.14.5	Because there is no grass.
JER.14.6	The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights;
JER.14.6	They pant for air like jackals,
JER.14.6	Their eyes fail
JER.14.6	For there is no vegetation.
JER.14.7	Although our iniquities testify against us,
JER.14.7	O L
JER.14.7	Truly our apostasies have been many,
JER.14.7	We have sinned against You.
JER.14.8	O Hope of Israel,
JER.14.8	Its Savior in time of distress,
JER.14.8	Why are You like a stranger in the land
JER.14.8	Or like a traveler who has pitched his 
JER.14.9	Why are You like a man dismayed,
JER.14.9	Like a mighty man who cannot save?
JER.14.9	Yet You are in our midst, O L
JER.14.9	And we are called by Your name;
JER.14.9	Do not forsake us!”
JER.14.10	Thus says the L
JER.14.11	So the L
JER.14.12	When they fast, I am not going to listen to their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I am not going to accept them. Rather I am going to make an end of them by the sword, famine and pestilence.”
JER.14.13	But, “Ah, Lord G
JER.14.14	Then the L
JER.14.15	Therefore thus says the L
JER.14.16	The people also to whom they are prophesying will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and there will be no one to bury them—
JER.14.17	You will say this word to them,
JER.14.17	‘Let my eyes flow down with tears night and day,
JER.14.17	And let them not cease;
JER.14.17	For the virgin daughter of my people has been crushed with a mighty blow,
JER.14.17	With a sorely infected wound.
JER.14.18	If I go out to the country,
JER.14.18	Behold, those slain with the sword!
JER.14.18	Or if I enter the city,
JER.14.18	Behold, diseases of famine!
JER.14.18	For both prophet and priest
JER.14.18	Have gone roving about in the land that they do not know.’ ”
JER.14.19	Have You completely rejected Judah?
JER.14.19	Or have You loathed Zion?
JER.14.19	Why have You stricken us so that we are beyond healing?
JER.14.19	And for a time of healing, but behold, terror!
JER.14.20	We know our wickedness, O L
JER.14.20	The iniquity of our fathers, for we have sinned against You.
JER.14.21	Do not despise 
JER.14.21	Do not disgrace the throne of Your glory;
JER.14.21	Remember 
JER.14.22	Are there any among the idols of the nations who give rain?
JER.14.22	Or can the heavens grant showers?
JER.14.22	Is it not You, O L
JER.14.22	Therefore we hope in You,
JER.14.22	For You are the one who has done all these things.
JER.15.1	Then the L
JER.15.2	And it shall be that when they say to you, ‘Where should we go?’ then you are to tell them, ‘Thus says the L
JER.15.2	“Those

JER.15.4	I will make them an object of horror among all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.
JER.15.5	“Indeed, who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem,
JER.15.5	Or who will mourn for you,
JER.15.5	Or who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?
JER.15.6	You who have forsaken Me,” declares the L
JER.15.6	“You keep going backward.
JER.15.6	So I will stretch out My hand against you and destroy you;
JER.15.6	I am tired of relenting!
JER.15.7	I will winnow them with a winnowing fork
JER.15.7	At the gates of the land;
JER.15.7	I will bereave 
JER.15.7	They did not repent of their ways.
JER.15.8	Their widows will be more numerous before Me
JER.15.8	Than the sand of the seas;
JER.15.8	I will bring against them, against the mother of a young man,
JER.15.8	A destroyer at noonday;
JER.15.8	I will suddenly bring down on her
JER.15.8	Anguish and dismay.
JER.15.9	She who bore seven 
JER.15.9	Her breathing is labored.
JER.15.9	Her sun has set while it was yet day;
JER.15.9	She has been shamed and humiliated.
JER.15.9	So I will give over their survivors to the sword
JER.15.9	Before their enemies,” declares the L

JER.15.10	I have not lent, nor have men lent money to me,
JER.15.11	The L

JER.15.11	In a time of disaster and a time of distress.
JER.15.12	“Can anyone smash iron,
JER.15.12	Iron from the north, or bronze?
JER.15.13	Your wealth and your treasures
JER.15.13	I will give for booty without cost,
JER.15.13	Even for all your sins
JER.15.13	And within all your borders.
JER.15.14	Then I will cause your enemies to bring 
JER.15.14	Into a land you do not know;
JER.15.14	For a fire has been kindled in My anger,
JER.15.14	It will burn upon you.”
JER.15.15	You who know, O L
JER.15.15	Remember me, take notice of me,
JER.15.15	And take vengeance for me on my persecutors.
JER.15.15	Do not, in view of Your patience, take me away;
JER.15.15	Know that for Your sake I endure reproach.
JER.15.16	Your words were found and I ate them,
JER.15.16	And Your words became for me a joy and the delight of my heart;
JER.15.16	For I have been called by Your name,
JER.15.16	O L
JER.15.17	I did not sit in the circle of merrymakers,
JER.15.17	Nor did I exult.
JER.15.17	Because of Your hand 
JER.15.17	For You filled me with indignation.
JER.15.18	Why has my pain been perpetual
JER.15.18	And my wound incurable, refusing to be healed?
JER.15.18	Will You indeed be to me like a deceptive 
JER.15.18	With water that is unreliable?
JER.15.19	Therefore, thus says the L
JER.15.19	“If you return, then I will restore you—
JER.15.19	Before Me you will stand;
JER.15.19	And if you extract the precious from the worthless,
JER.15.19	You will become My spokesman.
JER.15.19	They for their part may turn to you,
JER.15.19	But as for you, you must not turn to them.
JER.15.20	Then I will make you to this people
JER.15.20	A fortified wall of bronze;
JER.15.20	And though they fight against you,
JER.15.20	They will not prevail over you;
JER.15.20	For I am with you to save you
JER.15.20	And deliver you,” declares the L
JER.15.21	“So I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked,
JER.15.21	And I will redeem you from the grasp of the violent.”
JER.16.1	The word of the L
JER.16.2	“You shall not take a wife for yourself nor have sons or daughters in this place.” 
JER.16.3	For thus says the L
JER.16.4	“They will die of deadly diseases, they will not be lamented or buried; they will be as dung on the surface of the ground and come to an end by sword and famine, and their carcasses will become food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth.”
JER.16.5	For thus says the L
JER.16.6	Both great men and small will die in this land; they will not be buried, they will not be lamented, nor will anyone gash himself or shave his head for them. 
JER.16.7	Men will not break 
JER.16.8	Moreover you shall not go into a house of feasting to sit with them to eat and drink.” 
JER.16.9	For thus says the L
JER.16.10	“Now when you tell this people all these words, they will say to you, ‘For what reason has the L
JER.16.11	Then you are to say to them, ‘
JER.16.12	You too have done evil, 
JER.16.13	So I will hurl you out of this land into the land which you have not known, neither you nor your fathers; and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will grant you no favor.’
JER.16.14	“Therefore behold, days are coming,” declares the L
JER.16.15	but, ‘As the L

JER.16.18	I will first doubly repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted My land; they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable idols and with their abominations.”
JER.16.19	O L
JER.16.19	And my refuge in the day of distress,
JER.16.19	To You the nations will come
JER.16.19	From the ends of the earth and say,
JER.16.19	“Our fathers have inherited nothing but falsehood,
JER.16.19	Futility and things of no profit.”
JER.16.20	Can man make gods for himself?
JER.16.20	Yet they are not gods!
JER.16.21	“Therefore behold, I am going to make them know—
JER.16.21	This time I will make them know
JER.16.21	My power and My might;

JER.17.1	The sin of Judah is written down with an iron stylus;
JER.17.1	With a diamond point it is engraved upon the tablet of their heart
JER.17.1	And on the horns of their altars,
JER.17.2	As they remember their children,
JER.17.2	So they 
JER.17.2	By green trees on the high hills.
JER.17.3	O mountain of Mine in the countryside,
JER.17.3	I will give over your wealth and all your treasures for booty,
JER.17.3	Your high places for sin throughout your borders.
JER.17.4	And you will, even of yourself, let go of your inheritance
JER.17.4	That I gave you;
JER.17.4	And I will make you serve your enemies
JER.17.4	In the land which you do not know;
JER.17.4	For you have kindled a fire in My anger
JER.17.4	Which will burn forever.
JER.17.5	Thus says the L
JER.17.5	“Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind
JER.17.5	And makes flesh his strength,
JER.17.5	And whose heart turns away from the L
JER.17.6	For he will be like a bush in the desert
JER.17.6	And will not see when prosperity comes,
JER.17.6	But will live in stony wastes in the wilderness,
JER.17.6	A land of salt without inhabitant.
JER.17.7	Blessed is the man who trusts in the L
JER.17.7	And whose trust is the L
JER.17.8	For he will be like a tree planted by the water,
JER.17.8	That extends its roots by a stream
JER.17.8	And will not fear when the heat comes;
JER.17.8	But its leaves will be green,
JER.17.8	And it will not be anxious in a year of drought
JER.17.8	Nor cease to yield fruit.
JER.17.9	“The heart is more deceitful than all else
JER.17.9	And is desperately sick;
JER.17.9	Who can understand it?
JER.17.10	I, the L
JER.17.10	I test the mind,
JER.17.10	Even to give to each man according to his ways,
JER.17.10	According to the results of his deeds.
JER.17.11	As a partridge that hatches eggs which it has not laid,
JER.17.11	In the midst of his days it will forsake him,
JER.17.11	And in the end he will be a fool.”
JER.17.12	A glorious throne on high from the beginning
JER.17.12	Is the place of our sanctuary.
JER.17.13	O L
JER.17.13	All who forsake You will be put to shame.
JER.17.13	Those who turn away on earth will be written down,
JER.17.13	Because they have forsaken the fountain of living water, even the L
JER.17.14	Heal me, O L
JER.17.14	Save me and I will be saved,
JER.17.14	For You are my praise.
JER.17.15	Look, they keep saying to me,
JER.17.15	“Where is the word of the L
JER.17.15	Let it come now!”
JER.17.16	But as for me, I have not hurried away from 
JER.17.16	Nor have I longed for the woeful day;
JER.17.16	You Yourself know that the utterance of my lips
JER.17.16	Was in Your presence.
JER.17.17	Do not be a terror to me;
JER.17.17	You are my refuge in the day of disaster.
JER.17.18	Let those who persecute me be put to shame, but as for me, let me not be put to shame;
JER.17.18	Let them be dismayed, but let me not be dismayed.
JER.17.18	Bring on them a day of disaster,
JER.17.18	And crush them with twofold destruction!
JER.17.19	Thus the L
JER.17.20	and say to them, ‘Listen to the word of the L
JER.17.21	Thus says the L
JER.17.22	You shall not bring a load out of your houses on the sabbath day nor do any work, but keep the sabbath day holy, as I commanded your forefathers. 
JER.17.23	Yet they did not listen or incline their ears, but stiffened their necks in order not to listen or take correction.
JER.17.24	“But it will come about, if you listen attentively to Me,” declares the L
JER.17.25	then there will come in through the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever. 
JER.17.26	They will come in from the cities of Judah and from the environs of Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the lowland, from the hill country and from the Negev, bringing burnt offerings, sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving to the house of the L
JER.17.27	But if you do not listen to Me to keep the sabbath day holy by not carrying a load and coming in through the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem and not be quenched.” ’ ”
JER.18.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the L
JER.18.2	“Arise and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will announce My words to you.” 
JER.18.3	Then I went down to the potter’s house, and there he was, making something on the wheel. 
JER.18.4	But the vessel that he was making of clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter; so he remade it into another vessel, as it pleased the potter to make.
JER.18.5	Then the word of the L
JER.18.6	“Can I not, O house of Israel, deal with you as this potter 
JER.18.7	At one moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to uproot, to pull down, or to destroy 
JER.18.8	if that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will 
JER.18.9	Or at another moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to build up or to plant 
JER.18.10	if it does evil in My sight by not obeying My voice, then I will 
JER.18.11	So now then, speak to the men of Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying, ‘Thus says the L
JER.18.12	But they will say, ‘It’s hopeless! For we are going to follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’
JER.18.13	“Therefore thus says the L
JER.18.13	‘Ask now among the nations,
JER.18.13	Who ever heard the like of this?
JER.18.13	The virgin of Israel
JER.18.13	Has done a most appalling thing.
JER.18.14	Does the snow of Lebanon forsake the rock of the open country?
JER.18.14	Or is the cold flowing water 
JER.18.15	For My people have forgotten Me,
JER.18.15	They burn incense to worthless gods
JER.18.15	And they have stumbled from their ways,
JER.18.15	From the ancient paths,
JER.18.15	To walk in bypaths,
JER.18.15	Not on a highway,
JER.18.16	To make their land a desolation,
JER.18.16	Everyone who passes by it will be astonished
JER.18.16	And shake his head.
JER.18.17	Like an east wind I will scatter them
JER.18.17	Before the enemy;
JER.18.17	I will show them My back and not 
JER.18.17	In the day of their calamity.’ ”
JER.18.18	Then they said, “Come and let us devise plans against Jeremiah. Surely the law is not going to be lost to the priest, nor counsel to the sage, nor the 
JER.18.19	Do give heed to me, O L
JER.18.19	And listen to what my opponents are saying!
JER.18.20	Should good be repaid with evil?
JER.18.20	For they have dug a pit for me.
JER.18.20	Remember how I stood before You
JER.18.20	To speak good on their behalf,
JER.18.20	So as to turn away Your wrath from them.
JER.18.21	Therefore, give their children over to famine
JER.18.21	And deliver them up to the power of the sword;
JER.18.21	And let their wives become childless and widowed.
JER.18.21	Let their men also be smitten to death,
JER.18.21	Their young men struck down by the sword in battle.
JER.18.22	May an outcry be heard from their houses,
JER.18.22	When You suddenly bring raiders upon them;
JER.18.22	For they have dug a pit to capture me
JER.18.22	And hidden snares for my feet.
JER.18.23	Yet You, O L
JER.18.23	All their deadly designs against me;
JER.18.23	Do not forgive their iniquity
JER.18.23	Or blot out their sin from Your sight.
JER.18.23	But may they be overthrown before You;
JER.18.23	Deal with them in the time of Your anger!
JER.19.1	Thus says the L
JER.19.2	Then go out to the valley of Ben-hinnom, which is by the entrance of the potsherd gate, and proclaim there the words that I tell you, 
JER.19.3	and say, ‘Hear the word of the L
JER.19.4	Because they have forsaken Me and have made this an alien place and have burned sacrifices in it to other gods, that neither they nor their forefathers nor the kings of Judah had 
JER.19.5	and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, a thing which I never commanded or spoke of, nor did it 
JER.19.6	therefore, behold, days are coming,” declares the L
JER.19.7	I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of those who seek their life; and I will give over their carcasses as food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth. 
JER.19.8	I will also make this city a desolation and an 
JER.19.9	I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they will eat one another’s flesh in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies and those who seek their life will distress them.” ’
JER.19.10	“Then you are to break the jar in the sight of the men who accompany you 
JER.19.11	and say to them, ‘Thus says the L
JER.19.12	This is how I will treat this place and its inhabitants,” declares the L
JER.19.13	The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like the place Topheth, because of all the houses on whose rooftops they burned sacrifices to all the heavenly host and poured out drink offerings to other gods.” ’ ”
JER.19.14	Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the L
JER.19.15	“Thus says the L
JER.20.1	When Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer, who was chief officer in the house of the L
JER.20.2	Pashhur had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate, which was by the house of the L
JER.20.3	On the next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “Pashhur is not the name the L
JER.20.4	For thus says the L
JER.20.5	I will also give over all the wealth of this city, all its produce and all its costly things; even all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give over to the hand of their enemies, and they will plunder them, take them away and bring them to Babylon. 
JER.20.6	And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into captivity; and you will enter Babylon, and there you will die and there you will be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied.’ ”
JER.20.7	O L
JER.20.7	You have overcome me and prevailed.
JER.20.7	I have become a laughingstock all day long;
JER.20.7	Everyone mocks me.
JER.20.8	For each time I speak, I cry aloud;
JER.20.8	I proclaim violence and destruction,
JER.20.8	Because for me the word of the L
JER.20.8	In reproach and derision all day long.
JER.20.9	But if I say, “I will not remember Him
JER.20.9	Or speak anymore in His name,”
JER.20.9	Then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire
JER.20.9	Shut up in my bones;
JER.20.9	And I am weary of holding 
JER.20.9	And I cannot endure 
JER.20.10	For I have heard the whispering of many,
JER.20.10	“Terror on every side!
JER.20.10	Denounce 
JER.20.10	All my trusted friends,
JER.20.10	Watching for my fall, say:
JER.20.10	“Perhaps he will be deceived, so that we may prevail against him
JER.20.10	And take our revenge on him.”
JER.20.11	But the L
JER.20.11	Therefore my persecutors will stumble and not prevail.
JER.20.11	They will be utterly ashamed, because they have failed,
JER.20.11	With an everlasting disgrace that will not be forgotten.
JER.20.12	Yet, O L
JER.20.12	Who see the mind and the heart;
JER.20.12	Let me see Your vengeance on them;
JER.20.12	For to You I have set forth my cause.
JER.20.13	Sing to the L
JER.20.13	For He has delivered the soul of the needy one
JER.20.13	From the hand of evildoers.
JER.20.14	Cursed be the day when I was born;
JER.20.14	Let the day not be blessed when my mother bore me!
JER.20.15	Cursed be the man who brought the news
JER.20.15	To my father, saying,
JER.20.15	“A baby boy has been born to you!”
JER.20.16	But let that man be like the cities
JER.20.16	Which the L
JER.20.16	And let him hear an outcry in the morning
JER.20.16	And a shout of alarm at noon;
JER.20.17	Because he did not kill me before birth,
JER.20.17	So that my mother would have been my grave,
JER.20.17	And her womb ever pregnant.
JER.20.18	Why did I ever come forth from the womb
JER.20.18	To look on trouble and sorrow,
JER.20.18	So that my days have been spent in shame?
JER.21.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the L
JER.21.2	“Please inquire of the L
JER.21.3	Then Jeremiah said to them, “You shall say to Zedekiah as follows: 
JER.21.4	‘Thus says the L
JER.21.5	I Myself will war against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, even in anger and wrath and great indignation. 
JER.21.6	I will also strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they will die of a great pestilence. 
JER.21.7	Then afterwards,” declares the L
JER.21.8	“You shall also say to this people, ‘Thus says the L
JER.21.9	He who dwells in this city will die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence; but he who goes out and falls away to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live, and he will have his own life as booty. 
JER.21.10	For I have set My face against this city for harm and not for good,” declares the L

JER.22.13	And his upper rooms without justice,

JER.23.10	The pastures of the wilderness have dried up.

JER.23.13	They prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray.
JER.23.14	Also among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing:
JER.23.14	The committing of adultery and walking in falsehood;

JER.23.14	So that no one has turned back from his wickedness.

JER.25.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), 
JER.25.2	which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,

JER.25.11	This whole land will be a desolation and a horror, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
JER.25.12	‘Then it will be when seventy years are completed I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,’ declares the L
JER.25.13	I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations. 
JER.25.14	(For many nations and great kings will make slaves of them, even them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands.)’ ”
JER.25.15	For thus the L
JER.25.16	They will drink and stagger and go mad because of the sword that I will send among them.”

JER.25.38	Because of the fierceness of the oppressing

JER.26.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the L
JER.26.2	“Thus says the L
JER.26.3	Perhaps they will listen and everyone will turn from his evil way, that I may repent of the calamity which I am planning to do to them because of the evil of their deeds.’

JER.26.7	The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the L
JER.26.8	When Jeremiah finished speaking all that the L

JER.26.10	When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to the house of the L

JER.26.12	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and to all the people, saying, “The L

JER.26.18	“Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Thus the L

JER.26.18	And Jerusalem will become ruins,
JER.26.18	And the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.” ’
JER.26.19	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the L
JER.26.20	Indeed, there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the L
JER.26.21	When King Jehoiakim and all his mighty men and all the officials heard his words, then the king sought to put him to death; but Uriah heard 
JER.26.22	Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor and 
JER.26.23	And they brought Uriah from Egypt and led him to King Jehoiakim, who slew him with a sword and cast his dead body into the burial place of the common people.
JER.26.24	But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not given into the hands of the people to put him to death.
JER.27.1	In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the L
JER.27.2	thus says the L
JER.27.3	and send word to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of the sons of Ammon, to the king of Tyre and to the king of Sidon by the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. 
JER.27.4	Command them 
JER.27.5	“I have made the earth, the men and the beasts which are on the face of the earth by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and I will give it to the one who is pleasing in My sight.

JER.27.7	All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson until the time of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings will make him their servant.

JER.27.11	But the nation which will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let remain on its land,” declares the L
JER.27.12	I spoke words like all these to Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and live! 
JER.27.13	Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, famine and pestilence, as the L
JER.27.14	So do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they prophesy a lie to you; 
JER.27.15	for I have not sent them,” declares the L
JER.27.17	Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live! Why should this city become a ruin? 
JER.27.18	But if they are prophets, and if the word of the L

JER.27.20	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried into exile Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem. 
JER.27.21	Yes, thus says the L
JER.27.22	‘They will be carried to Babylon and they will be there until the day I visit them,’ declares the L
JER.28.1	Now in the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the L
JER.28.2	“Thus says the L
JER.28.3	Within two years I am going to bring back to this place all the vessels of the L
JER.28.4	I am also going to bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares the L
JER.28.5	Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who were standing in the house of the L
JER.28.6	and the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the L
JER.28.7	Yet hear now this word which I am about to speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people! 
JER.28.8	The prophets who were before me and before you from ancient times prophesied against many lands and against great kingdoms, of war and of calamity and of pestilence. 
JER.28.9	The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, then that prophet will be known 
JER.28.10	Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it. 
JER.28.11	Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Thus says the L

JER.29.1	Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the exile, the priests, the prophets and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
JER.29.2	(This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the court officials, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem.) 
JER.29.3	 by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying,

JER.34.7	when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah, 
JER.34.8	The word which came to Jeremiah from the L

JER.34.11	But afterward they turned around and took back the male servants and the female servants whom they had set free, and brought them into subjection for male servants and for female servants.
JER.34.12	Then the word of the L

JER.35.8	We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons or our daughters, 
JER.35.9	nor to build ourselves houses to dwell in; and we do not have vineyard or field or seed. 
JER.35.10	We have only dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and have done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.

JER.36.11	Now when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard all the words of the L
JER.36.12	he went down to the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber. And behold, all the officials were sitting there—Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the 
JER.36.13	Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read from the book to the people. 
JER.36.14	Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and went to them. 
JER.36.15	They said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it to us.” So Baruch read it to them. 
JER.36.16	When they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one to another and said to Baruch, “We will surely report all these words to the king.” 
JER.36.17	And they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? 
JER.36.18	Then Baruch said to them, “He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink on the book.” 
JER.36.19	Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go, hide yourself, you and Jeremiah, and do not let anyone know where you are.”
JER.36.20	So they went to the king in the court, but they had deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and they reported all the words to the king. 
JER.36.21	Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it to the king as well as to all the officials who stood beside the king. 
JER.36.22	Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, with 
JER.36.23	When Jehudi had read three or four columns, 
JER.36.24	Yet the king and all his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, nor did they rend their garments. 
JER.36.25	Even though Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. 
JER.36.26	And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the L
JER.36.27	Then the word of the L
JER.36.28	“Take again another scroll and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned. 
JER.36.29	And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Thus says the L
JER.36.30	Therefore thus says the L
JER.36.31	I will also punish him and his descendants and his servants for their iniquity, and I will bring on them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the men of Judah all the calamity that I have declared to them—but they did not listen.” ’ ”
JER.36.32	Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah, the scribe, and he wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.
JER.37.1	Now Zedekiah the son of Josiah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had made king in the land of Judah, reigned as king in place of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim. 
JER.37.2	But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the L
JER.37.3	Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Please pray to the L
JER.37.4	Now Jeremiah was 
JER.37.5	Meanwhile, Pharaoh’s army had set out from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who had been besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they lifted the 
JER.37.6	Then the word of the L
JER.37.7	“Thus says the L
JER.37.8	The Chaldeans will also return and fight against this city, and they will capture it and burn it with fire.” ’ 
JER.37.9	Thus says the L
JER.37.10	For even if you had defeated the entire army of Chaldeans who were fighting against you, and there were 
JER.37.11	Now it happened when the army of the Chaldeans had lifted 
JER.37.12	that Jeremiah went out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin in order to take possession of 
JER.37.13	While he was at the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah was there; and he arrested Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are going over to the Chaldeans!” 
JER.37.14	But Jeremiah said, “A lie! I am not going over to the Chaldeans”; yet he would not listen to him. So Irijah arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. 
JER.37.15	Then the officials were angry at Jeremiah and beat him, and they put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe, which they had made into the prison. 
JER.37.16	For Jeremiah had come into the dungeon, that is, the vaulted cell; and Jeremiah stayed there many days.
JER.37.17	Now King Zedekiah sent and took him 
JER.37.18	Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “
JER.37.19	Where then are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land’? 
JER.37.20	But now, please listen, O my lord the king; please let my petition come before you and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, that I may not die there.” 
JER.37.21	Then King Zedekiah gave commandment, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guardhouse and gave him a loaf of bread daily from the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guardhouse.
JER.38.1	Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying, 
JER.38.2	“Thus says the L
JER.38.3	Thus says the L
JER.38.4	Then the officials said to the king, “Now let this man be put to death, inasmuch as he is discouraging the men of war who are left in this city and all the people, by speaking such words to them; for this man is not seeking the well-being of this people but rather their harm.” 
JER.38.5	So King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can 
JER.38.6	Then they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern 
JER.38.7	But Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, while he was in the king’s palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. Now the king was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin; 
JER.38.8	and Ebed-melech went out from the king’s palace and spoke to the king, saying, 
JER.38.9	“My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the cistern; and he will die right where he is because of the famine, for there is no more bread in the city.” 
JER.38.10	Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take thirty men from here under your authority and bring up Jeremiah the prophet from the cistern before he dies.” 
JER.38.11	So Ebed-melech took the men under his authority and went into the king’s palace to 
JER.38.12	Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these worn-out clothes and rags under your armpits under the ropes”; and Jeremiah did so. 
JER.38.13	So they pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern, and Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse.
JER.38.14	Then King Zedekiah sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance that is in the house of the L
JER.38.15	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not certainly put me to death? Besides, if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.” 
JER.38.16	But King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in secret saying, “As the L
JER.38.17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the L
JER.38.18	But if you will not go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given over to the hand of the Chaldeans; and they will burn it with fire, and you yourself will not escape from their hand.’ ” 
JER.38.19	Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I dread the Jews who have gone over to the Chaldeans, for they may give me over into their hand and they will abuse me.” 
JER.38.20	But Jeremiah said, “They will not give you over. Please obey the L
JER.38.21	But if you keep refusing to go out, this is the word which the L
JER.38.22	‘Then behold, all of the women who have been left in the palace of the king of Judah are going to be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon; and those women will say,
JER.38.22	“Your close friends
JER.38.22	Have misled and overpowered you;
JER.38.22	While your feet were sunk in the mire,
JER.38.22	They turned back.”
JER.38.23	They will also bring out all your wives and your sons to the Chaldeans, and you yourself will not escape from their hand, but will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned with fire.’ ”
JER.38.24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no man know about these words and you will not die. 
JER.38.25	But if the officials hear that I have talked with you and come to you and say to you, ‘Tell us now what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide 
JER.38.26	then you are to say to them, ‘I was presenting my petition before the king, not to make me return to the house of Jonathan to die there.’ ” 
JER.38.27	Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him. So he reported to them in accordance with all these words which the king had commanded; and they ceased speaking with him, since the conversation had not been overheard. 
JER.38.28	So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse until the day that Jerusalem was captured.
JER.39.1	Now when Jerusalem was captured in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it; 
JER.39.2	in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, in the ninth 
JER.39.3	Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat down at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sar-ezer, Samgar-nebu, Sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer 
JER.39.4	When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they fled and went out of the city at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the 
JER.39.5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and they seized him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. 
JER.39.6	Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes at Riblah; the king of Babylon also slew all the nobles of Judah. 
JER.39.7	He then blinded Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in fetters of bronze to bring him to Babylon. 
JER.39.8	The Chaldeans also burned with fire the king’s palace and the houses of the people, and they broke down the walls of Jerusalem. 
JER.39.9	As for the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had gone over to him and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard carried 
JER.39.10	But some of the poorest people who had nothing, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard left behind in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at that time.
JER.39.11	Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, saying, 
JER.39.12	“Take him and look after him, and do nothing harmful to him, but rather deal with him just as he tells you.” 
JER.39.13	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard sent 
JER.39.14	they even sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guardhouse and entrusted him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he stayed among the people.
JER.39.15	Now the word of the L
JER.39.16	“Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Thus says the L
JER.39.17	But I will deliver you on that day,” declares the L
JER.39.18	For I will certainly rescue you, and you will not fall by the sword; but you will have your 
JER.40.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the L
JER.40.2	Now the captain of the bodyguard had taken Jeremiah and said to him, “The L
JER.40.3	and the L
JER.40.4	But now, behold, I am freeing you today from the chains which are on your hands. If you would prefer to come with me to Babylon, come 
JER.40.5	As Jeremiah was still not going back, 
JER.40.6	Then Jeremiah went to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.
JER.40.7	Now all the commanders of the forces that were in the field, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam over the land and that he had put him in charge of the men, women and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been exiled to Babylon. 
JER.40.8	So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, along with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, 
JER.40.9	Then Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, “Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans; stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, that it may go well with you. 
JER.40.10	Now as for me, behold, I am going to stay at Mizpah to stand 
JER.40.11	Likewise, also all the Jews who were in Moab and among the sons of Ammon and in Edom and who were in all the 
JER.40.12	Then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been driven away and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered in wine and summer fruit in great abundance.
JER.40.13	Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah 
JER.40.14	and said to him, “Are you well aware that Baalis the king of the sons of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them. 
JER.40.15	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, “Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and not a man will know! Why should he take your life, so that all the Jews who are gathered to you would be scattered and the remnant of Judah would perish?” 
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “Do not do this thing, for you are telling a lie about Ishmael.”
JER.41.1	In the seventh month Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family and 
JER.41.2	Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him arose and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and put to death the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land. 
JER.41.3	Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with him, 
JER.41.4	Now it happened on the next day after the killing of Gedaliah, when no one knew about 
JER.41.5	that eighty men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria with their beards shaved off and their clothes torn and their bodies gashed, having grain offerings and incense in their hands to bring to the house of the L
JER.41.6	Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went; and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!” 
JER.41.7	Yet it turned out that as soon as they came inside the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men that were with him slaughtered them 
JER.41.8	But ten men who were found among them said to Ishmael, “Do not put us to death; for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil and honey hidden in the field.” So he refrained and did not put them to death along with their companions.
JER.41.9	Now as for the cistern where Ishmael had cast all the corpses of the men whom he had struck down because of Gedaliah, it was the one that King Asa had made on account of Baasha, king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain. 
JER.41.10	Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people who were in Mizpah, the king’s daughters and all the people who were left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had put under the charge of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; thus Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and proceeded to cross over to the sons of Ammon.
JER.41.11	But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done. 
JER.41.12	So they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and they found him by the great pool that is in Gibeon. 
JER.41.13	Now as soon as all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and the commanders of the forces that were with him, they were glad. 
JER.41.14	So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. 
JER.41.15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the sons of Ammon. 
JER.41.16	Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, 
JER.41.17	And they went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, which is beside Bethlehem, in order to proceed into Egypt 
JER.41.18	because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, since Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
JER.42.1	Then all the commanders of the forces, Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people both small and great approached 
JER.42.2	and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please let our petition come before you, and pray for us to the L
JER.42.3	that the L
JER.42.4	Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard 
JER.42.5	Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the L
JER.42.6	Whether 
JER.42.7	Now at the end of ten days the word of the L
JER.42.8	Then he called for Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him, and for all the people both small and great, 
JER.42.9	and said to them, “Thus says the L
JER.42.10	‘If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down, and I will plant you and not uproot you; for I will relent concerning the calamity that I have inflicted on you. 
JER.42.11	Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you are 
JER.42.12	I will also show you compassion, so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your own soil. 
JER.42.13	But if you are going to say, “We will not stay in this land,” so as not to listen to the voice of the L
JER.42.14	saying, “No, but we will go to the land of Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the sound of a trumpet or hunger for bread, and we will stay there”; 
JER.42.15	then in that case listen to the word of the L
JER.42.16	then the sword, which you are afraid of, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are anxious, will follow closely after you there 
JER.42.17	So all the men who set their mind to go to Egypt to reside there will die by the sword, by famine and by pestilence; and they will have no survivors or refugees from the calamity that I am going to bring on them.” ’ ”
JER.42.18	For thus says the L
JER.42.19	The L
JER.42.20	For you have 
JER.42.21	So I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the L
JER.42.22	Therefore you should now clearly understand that you will die by the sword, by famine and by pestilence, in the place where you wish to go to reside.
JER.43.1	But as soon as Jeremiah, whom the L
JER.43.2	Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie! The L
JER.43.3	but Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us to give us over into the hand of the Chaldeans, so they will put us to death or exile us to Babylon.” 
JER.43.4	So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces, and all the people, did not obey the voice of the L
JER.43.5	But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the entire remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations to which they had been driven away, in order to reside in the land of Judah— 
JER.43.6	the men, the women, the children, the king’s daughters and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, together with Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah— 
JER.43.7	and they entered the land of Egypt (for they did not obey the voice of the L
JER.43.8	Then the word of the L
JER.43.9	“Take 
JER.43.10	and say to them, ‘Thus says the L
JER.43.11	He will also come and strike the land of Egypt; those who are 
JER.43.12	And I shall set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he will burn them and take them captive. So he will wrap himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps himself with his garment, and he will depart from there safely. 
JER.43.13	He will also shatter the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt; and the temples of the gods of Egypt he will burn with fire.” ’ ”
JER.44.1	The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt, those who were living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the land of Pathros, saying, 
JER.44.2	“Thus says the L
JER.44.3	because of their wickedness which they committed so as to provoke Me to anger by continuing to burn sacrifices 
JER.44.4	Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets, again and again, saying, “Oh, do not do this abominable thing which I hate.” 
JER.44.5	But they did not listen or incline their ears to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn sacrifices to other gods. 
JER.44.6	Therefore My wrath and My anger were poured out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, so they have become a ruin and a desolation as it is this day. 
JER.44.7	Now then thus says the L
JER.44.8	provoking Me to anger with the works of your hands, burning sacrifices to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you are entering to reside, so that you might be cut off and become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? 
JER.44.9	Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.44.10	But they have not become contrite even to this day, nor have they feared nor walked in My law or My statutes, which I have set before you and before your fathers.” ’
JER.44.11	“Therefore thus says the L
JER.44.12	And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have set their mind on entering the land of Egypt to reside there, and they will all meet their end in the land of Egypt; they will fall by the sword 
JER.44.13	And I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine and with pestilence. 
JER.44.14	So there will be no refugees or survivors for the remnant of Judah who have entered the land of Egypt to reside there and then to return to the land of Judah, to which they are longing to return and live; for none will return except 
JER.44.15	Then all the men who were aware that their wives were burning sacrifices to other gods, along with all the women who were standing by, 
JER.44.16	“As for the message that you have spoken to us in the name of the L
JER.44.17	But rather we will certainly carry out every word that has proceeded from our mouths, by burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, just as we ourselves, our forefathers, our kings and our princes did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for 
JER.44.18	But since we stopped burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have met our end by the sword and by famine.” 
JER.44.19	“And,” 
JER.44.20	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and women—even to all the people who were giving him 
JER.44.21	“As for the smoking sacrifices that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your forefathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the L
JER.44.22	So the L
JER.44.23	Because you have burned sacrifices and have sinned against the L
JER.44.24	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the word of the L
JER.44.25	thus says the L
JER.44.26	Nevertheless hear the word of the L
JER.44.27	Behold, I am watching over them for harm and not for good, and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will meet their end by the sword and by famine until they are completely gone. 
JER.44.28	Those who escape the sword will return out of the land of Egypt to the land of Judah few in number. Then all the remnant of Judah who have gone to the land of Egypt to reside there will know whose word will stand, Mine or theirs. 
JER.44.29	This will be the sign to you,’ declares the L
JER.44.30	Thus says the L
JER.45.2	“Thus says the L

JER.45.5	But you, are you seeking great things for yourself? Do not seek 
JER.46.1	That which came as the word of the L
JER.46.2	To Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
JER.46.3	“Line up the shield and buckler,
JER.46.3	And draw near for the battle!

JER.46.4	And take your stand with helmets 
JER.46.4	Polish the spears,
JER.46.4	Put on the scale-armor!
JER.46.5	Why have I seen 
JER.46.5	They are terrified,
JER.46.5	They are drawing back,
JER.46.5	And their mighty men are defeated
JER.46.5	And have taken refuge in flight,
JER.46.5	Without facing back;
JER.46.5	Terror is on every side!”
JER.46.5	Declares the L
JER.46.6	Let not the swift man flee,
JER.46.6	Nor the mighty man escape;
JER.46.6	In the north beside the river Euphrates
JER.46.6	They have stumbled and fallen.
JER.46.7	Who is this that rises like the Nile,
JER.46.7	Like the rivers whose waters surge about?
JER.46.8	Egypt rises like the Nile,
JER.46.8	Even like the rivers whose waters surge about;
JER.46.8	And He has said, “I will rise and cover 
JER.46.8	I will surely destroy the city and its inhabitants.”
JER.46.9	Go up, you horses, and drive madly, you chariots,
JER.46.9	That the mighty men may march forward:
JER.46.9	Ethiopia and Put, that handle the shield,
JER.46.9	And the Lydians, that handle 
JER.46.10	For that day belongs to the Lord G
JER.46.10	A day of vengeance, so as to avenge Himself on His foes;
JER.46.10	And the sword will devour and be satiated
JER.46.10	And drink its fill of their blood;
JER.46.10	For there will be a slaughter for the Lord G
JER.46.10	In the land of the north by the river Euphrates.
JER.46.11	Go up to Gilead and obtain balm,
JER.46.11	O virgin daughter of Egypt!
JER.46.11	In vain have you multiplied remedies;
JER.46.11	There is no healing for you.
JER.46.12	The nations have heard of your shame,
JER.46.12	And the earth is full of your cry 
JER.46.12	For one warrior has stumbled over another,
JER.46.12	And both of them have fallen down together.
JER.46.14	“Declare in Egypt and proclaim in Migdol,
JER.46.14	Proclaim also in Memphis and Tahpanhes;
JER.46.14	Say, ‘Take your stand and get yourself ready,
JER.46.14	For the sword has devoured those around you.’
JER.46.15	Why have your mighty ones become prostrate?
JER.46.15	They do not stand because the L
JER.46.16	They have repeatedly stumbled;
JER.46.16	Indeed, they have fallen one against another.
JER.46.16	Then they said, ‘Get up! And let us go back
JER.46.16	To our own people and our native land
JER.46.16	Away from the sword of the oppressor.’
JER.46.17	They cried there, ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt 
JER.46.17	He has let the appointed time pass by!’
JER.46.18	As I live,” declares the King
JER.46.18	Whose name is the L
JER.46.18	“Surely one shall come 
JER.46.18	Or like Carmel by the sea.
JER.46.19	Make your baggage ready for exile,
JER.46.19	O daughter dwelling in Egypt,
JER.46.19	For Memphis will become a desolation;
JER.46.19	It will even be burned down 
JER.46.20	Egypt is a pretty heifer,
JER.46.21	Also her mercenaries in her midst
JER.46.21	Are like fattened calves,
JER.46.21	For even they too have turned back 
JER.46.21	They did not stand 
JER.46.21	For the day of their calamity has come upon them,
JER.46.21	The time of their punishment.
JER.46.22	Its sound moves along like a serpent;
JER.46.22	For they move on like an army
JER.46.22	And come to her as woodcutters with axes.
JER.46.23	They have cut down her forest,” declares the L
JER.46.23	“Surely it will no 
JER.46.23	Even though they are 
JER.46.23	And are without number.
JER.46.24	The daughter of Egypt has been put to shame,

JER.46.25	The L

JER.46.27	“But as for you, O Jacob My servant, do not fear,
JER.46.27	Nor be dismayed, O Israel!
JER.46.27	For, see, I am going to save you from afar,

JER.46.28	Yet I will not make a full end of you;
JER.46.28	But I will correct you properly
JER.46.28	And by no means leave you unpunished.”
JER.47.1	That which came as the word of the L
JER.47.2	Thus says the L
JER.47.2	“Behold, waters are going to rise from the north
JER.47.2	And become an overflowing torrent,
JER.47.2	And overflow the land and all its fullness,
JER.47.2	The city and those who live in it;

JER.47.2	And every inhabitant of the land will wail.
JER.47.3	Because of the noise of the galloping hoofs of his stallions,
JER.47.3	The tumult of his chariots, 
JER.47.3	The fathers have not turned back for 
JER.47.3	Because of the limpness of

JER.47.4	To destroy all the Philistines,
JER.47.4	To cut off from Tyre and Sidon
JER.47.4	Every ally that is left;
JER.47.4	For the L
JER.47.4	The remnant of the coastland of Caphtor.
JER.47.5	Baldness has come upon Gaza;
JER.47.5	Ashkelon has been ruined.
JER.47.5	O remnant of their valley,
JER.47.5	How long will you gash yourself?
JER.47.6	Ah, sword of the L
JER.47.6	How long will you not be quiet?
JER.47.6	Withdraw into your sheath;
JER.47.6	Be at rest and stay still.
JER.47.7	How can it be quiet,
JER.47.7	When the L

JER.47.7	There He has assigned it.”
JER.48.1	Concerning Moab. Thus says the L
JER.48.1	“Woe to Nebo, for it has been destroyed;
JER.48.1	Kiriathaim has been put to shame, it has been captured;
JER.48.1	The lofty stronghold has been put to shame and shattered.
JER.48.2	There is praise for Moab no longer;
JER.48.2	In Heshbon they have devised calamity against her:
JER.48.2	‘Come and let us cut her off from 
JER.48.2	You too, 
JER.48.2	The sword will follow after you.
JER.48.3	The sound of an outcry from Horonaim,
JER.48.3	‘Devastation and great destruction!’
JER.48.4	Moab is broken,
JER.48.4	Her little ones have sounded out a cry 
JER.48.5	For by the ascent of Luhith
JER.48.5	They will ascend with continual weeping;
JER.48.5	For at the descent of Horonaim
JER.48.5	They have heard the anguished cry of destruction.
JER.48.6	Flee, save your lives,
JER.48.6	That you may be like a juniper in the wilderness.
JER.48.7	For because of your trust in your own achievements and treasures,
JER.48.7	Even you yourself will be captured;
JER.48.7	And Chemosh will go off into exile
JER.48.7	Together with his priests and his princes.
JER.48.8	A destroyer will come to every city,
JER.48.8	So that no city will escape;
JER.48.8	The valley also will be ruined
JER.48.8	And the plateau will be destroyed,
JER.48.8	As the L
JER.48.9	Give wings to Moab,
JER.48.9	For she will flee away;
JER.48.9	And her cities will become a desolation,
JER.48.9	Without inhabitants in them.
JER.48.10	Cursed be the one who does the L
JER.48.10	And cursed be the one who restrains his sword from blood.
JER.48.11	“Moab has been at ease since his youth;
JER.48.11	He has also been undisturbed, 
JER.48.11	And he has not been emptied from vessel to vessel,
JER.48.11	Nor has he gone into exile.
JER.48.11	Therefore he retains his flavor,
JER.48.11	And his aroma has not changed.
JER.48.12	Therefore behold, the days are coming,” declares the L
JER.48.13	And Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.
JER.48.14	How can you say, ‘We are mighty warriors,
JER.48.14	And men valiant for battle’?
JER.48.15	Moab has been destroyed and men have gone up to his cities;
JER.48.15	His choicest young men have also gone down to the slaughter,”
JER.48.15	Declares the King, whose name is the L
JER.48.16	“The disaster of Moab will soon come,
JER.48.16	And his calamity has swiftly hastened.
JER.48.17	Mourn for him, all you who 
JER.48.17	Even all of you who know his name;
JER.48.17	Say, ‘How has the mighty scepter been broken,
JER.48.17	A staff of splendor!’
JER.48.18	Come down from your glory
JER.48.18	And sit on the parched ground,
JER.48.18	O daughter dwelling in Dibon,
JER.48.18	For the destroyer of Moab has come up against you,
JER.48.18	He has ruined your strongholds.
JER.48.19	Stand by the road and keep watch,
JER.48.19	O inhabitant of Aroer;
JER.48.19	Ask him who flees and her who escapes
JER.48.20	Moab has been put to shame, for it has been shattered.
JER.48.20	Wail and cry out;
JER.48.20	Declare by the Arnon
JER.48.20	That Moab has been destroyed.
JER.48.21	“Judgment has also come upon the plain, upon Holon, Jahzah and against Mephaath, 
JER.48.22	against Dibon, Nebo and Beth-diblathaim, 
JER.48.23	against Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul and Beth-meon, 
JER.48.24	against Kerioth, Bozrah and all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near. 
JER.48.25	The horn of Moab has been cut off and his arm broken,” declares the L
JER.48.26	“Make him drunk, for he has become arrogant toward the L
JER.48.27	Now was not Israel a laughingstock to you? Or was he caught among thieves? For each time you speak about him you shake 
JER.48.28	Leave the cities and dwell among the crags,
JER.48.28	O inhabitants of Moab,
JER.48.28	And be like a dove that nests
JER.48.28	Beyond the mouth of the chasm.
JER.48.29	We have heard of the pride of Moab—he 
JER.48.29	Of his haughtiness, his pride, his arrogance and his self-exaltation.
JER.48.30	I know his fury,” declares the L
JER.48.30	“But it is futile;
JER.48.30	His idle boasts have accomplished nothing.
JER.48.31	Therefore I will wail for Moab,
JER.48.31	Even for all Moab will I cry out;
JER.48.31	I will moan for the men of Kir-heres.
JER.48.32	More than the weeping for Jazer
JER.48.32	I will weep for you, O vine of Sibmah!
JER.48.32	Your tendrils stretched across the sea,
JER.48.32	They reached to the sea of Jazer;
JER.48.32	Upon your summer fruits and your grape harvest
JER.48.32	The destroyer has fallen.
JER.48.33	So gladness and joy are taken away
JER.48.33	From the fruitful field, even from the land of Moab.
JER.48.33	And I have made the wine to cease from the wine presses;
JER.48.33	No one will tread 
JER.48.33	The shouting will not be shouts 
JER.48.34	From the outcry at Heshbon even to Elealeh, even to Jahaz they have raised their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim 
JER.48.35	I will make an end of Moab,” declares the L
JER.48.36	“Therefore My heart wails for Moab like flutes; My heart also wails like flutes for the men of Kir-heres. Therefore they have lost the abundance it produced. 
JER.48.37	For every head is bald and every beard cut short; there are gashes on all the hands and sackcloth on the loins. 
JER.48.38	On all the housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation everywhere; for I have broken Moab like an undesirable vessel,” declares the L
JER.48.39	“How shattered it is! 
JER.48.40	For thus says the L
JER.48.40	“Behold, one will fly swiftly like an eagle
JER.48.40	And spread out his wings against Moab.
JER.48.41	Kerioth has been captured
JER.48.41	And the strongholds have been seized,
JER.48.41	So the hearts of the mighty men of Moab in that day
JER.48.41	Will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
JER.48.42	Moab will be destroyed from 
JER.48.42	Because he has become arrogant toward the L
JER.48.43	Terror, pit and snare are 
JER.48.43	O inhabitant of Moab,” declares the L
JER.48.44	“The one who flees from the terror
JER.48.44	Will fall into the pit,
JER.48.44	And the one who climbs up out of the pit
JER.48.44	Will be caught in the snare;
JER.48.44	For I shall bring upon her, 
JER.48.44	The year of their punishment,” declares the L
JER.48.45	“In the shadow of Heshbon
JER.48.45	The fugitives stand without strength;
JER.48.45	For a fire has gone forth from Heshbon
JER.48.45	And a flame from the midst of Sihon,
JER.48.45	And it has devoured the forehead of Moab
JER.48.45	And the scalps of the riotous revelers.
JER.48.46	Woe to you, Moab!
JER.48.46	The people of Chemosh have perished;
JER.48.46	For your sons have been taken away captive
JER.48.46	And your daughters into captivity.
JER.48.47	Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab
JER.48.47	In the latter days,” declares the L
JER.49.1	Concerning the sons of Ammon. Thus says the L
JER.49.1	“Does Israel have no sons?
JER.49.1	Or has he no heirs?
JER.49.1	Why then has Malcam taken possession of Gad
JER.49.1	And his people settled in its cities?
JER.49.2	Therefore behold, the days are coming,” declares the L
JER.49.2	“That I will cause a trumpet blast of war to be heard
JER.49.2	Against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon;
JER.49.2	And it will become a desolate heap,
JER.49.2	And her towns will be set on fire.
JER.49.2	Then Israel will take possession of his possessors,”
JER.49.2	Says the L
JER.49.3	“Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai has been destroyed!
JER.49.3	Cry out, O daughters of Rabbah,
JER.49.3	Gird yourselves with sackcloth and lament,
JER.49.3	And rush back and forth inside the walls;
JER.49.3	For Malcam will go into exile
JER.49.3	Together with his priests and his princes.
JER.49.4	How boastful you are about the valleys!
JER.49.4	Your valley is flowing 
JER.49.4	O backsliding daughter
JER.49.4	Who trusts in her treasures, 
JER.49.4	‘Who will come against me?’
JER.49.5	Behold, I am going to bring terror upon you,”
JER.49.5	Declares the Lord G
JER.49.5	“From all 
JER.49.5	And each of you will be driven out headlong,
JER.49.5	With no one to gather the fugitives together.
JER.49.6	But afterward I will restore
JER.49.6	The fortunes of the sons of Ammon,”
JER.49.6	Declares the L
JER.49.7	Concerning Edom.
JER.49.7	Thus says the L
JER.49.7	“Is there no longer any wisdom in Teman?
JER.49.7	Has good counsel been lost to the prudent?
JER.49.7	Has their wisdom decayed?
JER.49.8	Flee away, turn back, dwell in the depths,
JER.49.8	O inhabitants of Dedan,
JER.49.8	For I will bring the disaster of Esau upon him
JER.49.8	At the time I punish him.
JER.49.9	If grape gatherers came to you,
JER.49.9	Would they not leave gleanings?
JER.49.9	If thieves 
JER.49.9	They would destroy 
JER.49.10	But I have stripped Esau bare,
JER.49.10	I have uncovered his hiding places
JER.49.10	So that he will not be able to conceal himself;
JER.49.10	His offspring has been destroyed along with his relatives
JER.49.10	And his neighbors, and he is no more.
JER.49.11	Leave your orphans behind, I will keep 
JER.49.11	And let your widows trust in Me.”
JER.49.12	For thus says the L
JER.49.13	For I have sworn by Myself,” declares the L
JER.49.14	I have heard a message from the L
JER.49.14	And an envoy is sent among the nations, 
JER.49.14	“Gather yourselves together and come against her,
JER.49.14	And rise up for battle!”
JER.49.15	“For behold, I have made you small among the nations,
JER.49.15	Despised among men.
JER.49.16	As for the terror of you,
JER.49.16	The arrogance of your heart has deceived you,
JER.49.16	O you who live in the clefts of the rock,
JER.49.16	Who occupy the height of the hill.
JER.49.16	Though you make your nest as high as an eagle’s,
JER.49.16	I will bring you down from there,” declares the L
JER.49.17	“Edom will become an object of horror; everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss at all its wounds. 
JER.49.18	Like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah with its neighbors,” says the L
JER.49.19	Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan against a perennially watered pasture; for in an instant I will make him run away from it, and whoever is chosen I shall appoint over it. For who is like Me, and who will summon Me 
JER.49.20	Therefore hear the plan of the L
JER.49.21	The earth has quaked at the noise of their downfall. There is an outcry! The noise of it has been heard at the Red Sea. 
JER.49.22	Behold, He will mount up and swoop like an eagle and spread out His wings against Bozrah; and the hearts of the mighty men of Edom in that day will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
JER.49.23	Concerning Damascus.
JER.49.23	“Hamath and Arpad are put to shame,
JER.49.23	For they have heard bad news;
JER.49.23	They are disheartened.
JER.49.23	There is anxiety by the sea,
JER.49.23	It cannot be calmed.
JER.49.24	Damascus has become helpless;
JER.49.24	She has turned away to flee,
JER.49.24	And panic has gripped her;
JER.49.24	Distress and pangs have taken hold of her
JER.49.24	Like a woman in childbirth.
JER.49.25	How the city of praise has not been deserted,
JER.49.25	The town of My joy!
JER.49.26	Therefore, her young men will fall in her streets,
JER.49.26	And all the men of war will be silenced in that day,” declares the L
JER.49.27	“I will set fire to the wall of Damascus,
JER.49.27	And it will devour the fortified towers of Ben-hadad.”
JER.49.28	Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated. Thus says the L
JER.49.28	“Arise, go up to Kedar
JER.49.28	And devastate the men of the east.
JER.49.29	They will take away their tents and their flocks;
JER.49.29	They will carry off for themselves
JER.49.29	Their tent curtains, all their goods and their camels,
JER.49.29	And they will call out to one another, ‘Terror on every side!’
JER.49.30	Run away, flee! Dwell in the depths,
JER.49.30	O inhabitants of Hazor,” declares the L
JER.49.30	“For Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has formed a plan against you
JER.49.30	And devised a scheme against you.
JER.49.31	Arise, go up against a nation which is at ease,
JER.49.31	Which lives securely,” declares the L
JER.49.31	“It has no gates or bars;
JER.49.31	They dwell alone.
JER.49.32	Their camels will become plunder,
JER.49.32	And their many cattle for booty,
JER.49.32	And I will scatter to all the winds those who cut the corners 
JER.49.32	And I will bring their disaster from every side,” declares the L
JER.49.33	“Hazor will become a haunt of jackals,
JER.49.33	A desolation forever;
JER.49.33	No one will live there,
JER.49.33	Nor will a son of man reside in it.”
JER.49.34	That which came as the word of the L
JER.49.35	“Thus says the L
JER.49.35	‘Behold, I am going to break the bow of Elam,
JER.49.35	The finest of their might.
JER.49.36	I will bring upon Elam the four winds
JER.49.36	From the four ends of heaven,
JER.49.36	And will scatter them to all these winds;
JER.49.36	And there will be no nation
JER.49.36	To which the outcasts of Elam will not go.
JER.49.37	So I will shatter Elam before their enemies
JER.49.37	And before those who seek their lives;
JER.49.37	And I will bring calamity upon them,
JER.49.37	Even My fierce anger,’ declares the L
JER.49.37	‘And I will send out the sword after them
JER.49.37	Until I have consumed them.
JER.49.38	Then I will set My throne in Elam
JER.49.38	And destroy out of it king and princes,’
JER.49.38	Declares the L
JER.49.39	‘But it will come about in the last days
JER.49.39	That I will restore the fortunes of Elam,’ ”
JER.49.39	Declares the L
JER.50.1	The word which the L
JER.50.2	“Declare and proclaim among the nations.
JER.50.2	Proclaim it and lift up a standard.
JER.50.2	Do not conceal 
JER.50.2	‘Babylon has been captured,
JER.50.2	Bel has been put to shame, Marduk has been shattered;
JER.50.2	Her images have been put to shame, her idols have been shattered.’
JER.50.3	For a nation has come up against her out of the north; it will make her land an object of horror, and there will be no inhabitant in it. Both man and beast have wandered off, they have gone away!
JER.50.4	“In those days and at that time,” declares the L
JER.50.5	They will ask for the way to Zion, 
JER.50.6	“My people have become lost sheep;
JER.50.6	Their shepherds have led them astray.
JER.50.6	They have made them turn aside 
JER.50.6	They have gone along from mountain to hill
JER.50.6	And have forgotten their resting place.
JER.50.7	All who came upon them have devoured them;
JER.50.7	And their adversaries have said, ‘We are not guilty,
JER.50.7	Inasmuch as they have sinned against the L
JER.50.7	Even the L

JER.50.8	And go forth from the land of the Chaldeans;
JER.50.8	Be also like male goats at the head of the flock.
JER.50.9	For behold, I am going to arouse and bring up against Babylon
JER.50.9	A horde of great nations from the land of the north,
JER.50.9	And they will draw up 
JER.50.9	From there she will be taken captive.
JER.50.9	Their arrows will be like an expert warrior
JER.50.9	Who does not return empty-handed.
JER.50.10	Chaldea will become plunder;
JER.50.10	All who plunder her will have enough,” declares the L
JER.50.11	“Because you are glad, because you are jubilant,
JER.50.11	O you who pillage My heritage,
JER.50.11	Because you skip about like a threshing heifer
JER.50.11	And neigh like stallions,
JER.50.12	Your mother will be greatly ashamed,
JER.50.12	She who gave you birth will be humiliated.
JER.50.12	Behold, 
JER.50.12	A wilderness, a parched land and a desert.
JER.50.13	Because of the indignation of the L
JER.50.13	But she will be completely desolate;
JER.50.13	Everyone who passes by Babylon will be horrified
JER.50.13	And will hiss because of all her wounds.
JER.50.14	Draw up your battle lines against Babylon on every side,
JER.50.14	All you who bend the bow;
JER.50.14	Shoot at her, do not be sparing with 
JER.50.14	For she has sinned against the L
JER.50.15	Raise your battle cry against her on every side!
JER.50.15	She has given herself up, her pillars have fallen,
JER.50.15	Her walls have been torn down.
JER.50.15	For this is the vengeance of the L
JER.50.15	Take vengeance on her;
JER.50.15	As she has done

JER.50.16	And the one who wields the sickle at the time of harvest;
JER.50.16	From before the sword of the oppressor
JER.50.16	They will each turn back to his own people
JER.50.16	And they will each flee to his own land.
JER.50.17	“Israel is a scattered flock, the lions have driven 
JER.50.18	Therefore thus says the L
JER.50.19	And I will bring Israel back to his pasture and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan, and his desire will be satisfied in the hill country of Ephraim and Gilead.

JER.50.23	Has been cut off and broken!
JER.50.23	How Babylon has become
JER.50.23	An object of horror among the nations!
JER.50.24	I set a snare for you and you were also caught, O Babylon,
JER.50.24	While you yourself were not aware;
JER.50.24	You have been found and also seized
JER.50.24	Because you have engaged in conflict with the L
JER.50.25	The L
JER.50.25	And has brought forth the weapons of His indignation,
JER.50.25	For it is a work of the Lord G
JER.50.25	In the land of the Chaldeans.
JER.50.26	Come to her from the farthest border;
JER.50.26	Open up her barns,
JER.50.26	Pile her up like heaps
JER.50.26	And utterly destroy her,
JER.50.26	Let nothing be left to her.
JER.50.27	Put all her young bulls to the sword;
JER.50.27	Let them go down to the slaughter!
JER.50.27	Woe be upon them, for their day has come,
JER.50.27	The time of their punishment.
JER.50.28	There is a sound of fugitives and refugees from the land of Babylon,
JER.50.28	To declare in Zion the vengeance of the L
JER.50.28	Vengeance for His temple.
JER.50.29	“Summon 
JER.50.29	All those who bend the bow:
JER.50.29	Encamp against her on every side,
JER.50.29	Let there be no escape.
JER.50.29	Repay her according to her work;
JER.50.29	According to all that she has done, 
JER.50.29	For she has become arrogant against the L
JER.50.29	Against the Holy One of Israel.
JER.50.30	Therefore her young men will fall in her streets,
JER.50.30	And all her men of war will be silenced in that day,” declares the L
JER.50.31	“Behold, I am against you, O arrogant one,”
JER.50.31	Declares the Lord G
JER.50.31	“For your day has come,
JER.50.31	The time when I will punish you.
JER.50.32	The arrogant one will stumble and fall
JER.50.32	With no one to raise him up;
JER.50.32	And I will set fire to his cities
JER.50.32	And it will devour all his environs.”
JER.50.33	Thus says the L
JER.50.33	“The sons of Israel are oppressed,
JER.50.33	And the sons of Judah as well;
JER.50.33	And all who took them captive have held them fast,
JER.50.33	They have refused to let them go.
JER.50.34	Their Redeemer is strong, the L
JER.50.34	He will vigorously plead their case
JER.50.34	So that He may bring rest to the earth,
JER.50.34	But turmoil to the inhabitants of Babylon.
JER.50.35	A sword against the Chaldeans,” declares the L
JER.50.35	“And against the inhabitants of Babylon
JER.50.35	And against her officials and her wise men!
JER.50.36	A sword against the oracle priests, and they will become fools!
JER.50.36	A sword against her mighty men, and they will be shattered!
JER.50.37	A sword against their horses and against their chariots
JER.50.37	And against all the foreigners who are in the midst of her,
JER.50.37	And they will become women!
JER.50.37	A sword against her treasures, and they will be plundered!
JER.50.38	A drought on her waters, and they will be dried up!
JER.50.38	For it is a land of idols,
JER.50.38	And they are mad over fearsome idols.
JER.50.39	“Therefore the desert creatures will live 
JER.50.39	The ostriches also will live in it,
JER.50.39	And it will never again be inhabited
JER.50.39	Or dwelt in from generation to generation.
JER.50.40	As when God overthrew Sodom
JER.50.40	And Gomorrah with its neighbors,” declares the L
JER.50.40	“No man will live there,
JER.50.40	Nor will 
JER.50.41	“Behold, a people is coming from the north,
JER.50.41	And a great nation and many kings
JER.50.41	Will be aroused from the remote parts of the earth.
JER.50.42	They seize 
JER.50.42	They are cruel and have no mercy.
JER.50.42	Their voice roars like the sea;
JER.50.42	And they ride on horses,
JER.50.42	Marshalled like a man for the battle
JER.50.42	Against you, O daughter of Babylon.
JER.50.43	The king of Babylon has heard the report about them,
JER.50.43	And his hands hang limp;
JER.50.43	Distress has gripped him,
JER.50.43	Agony like a woman in childbirth.
JER.50.44	“Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thicket of the Jordan to a perennially watered pasture; for in an instant I will make them run away from it, and whoever is chosen I will appoint over it. For who is like Me, and who will summon Me 
JER.50.45	Therefore hear the plan of the L
JER.50.46	At the shout, “Babylon has been seized!” the earth is shaken, and an outcry is heard among the nations.
JER.51.1	Thus says the L
JER.51.1	“Behold, I am going to arouse against Babylon
JER.51.1	And against the inhabitants of 
JER.51.1	The spirit of a destroyer.
JER.51.2	I will dispatch foreigners to Babylon that they may winnow her
JER.51.2	And may devastate her land;
JER.51.2	For on every side they will be opposed to her
JER.51.2	In the day of 
JER.51.3	Let not him who bends his bow bend 
JER.51.3	Nor let him rise up in his scale-armor;
JER.51.3	So do not spare her young men;
JER.51.3	Devote all her army to destruction.
JER.51.4	They will fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans,
JER.51.4	And pierced through in their streets.”
JER.51.5	For neither Israel nor Judah has been forsaken
JER.51.5	By his God, the L
JER.51.5	Although their land is full of guilt
JER.51.5	Before the Holy One of Israel.
JER.51.6	Flee from the midst of Babylon,
JER.51.6	And each of you save his life!
JER.51.6	Do not be destroyed in her punishment,
JER.51.6	For this is the L
JER.51.6	He is going to render recompense to her.
JER.51.7	Babylon has been a golden cup in the hand of the L
JER.51.7	Intoxicating all the earth.
JER.51.7	The nations have drunk of her wine;
JER.51.7	Therefore the nations are going mad.
JER.51.8	Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken;
JER.51.8	Wail over her!
JER.51.8	Bring balm for her pain;
JER.51.8	Perhaps she may be healed.
JER.51.9	We applied healing to Babylon, but she was not healed;
JER.51.9	Forsake her and let us each go to his own country,
JER.51.9	For her judgment has reached to heaven
JER.51.9	And towers up to the very skies.
JER.51.10	The L
JER.51.10	Come and let us recount in Zion
JER.51.10	The work of the L
JER.51.11	Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers!
JER.51.11	The L
JER.51.11	Because His purpose is against Babylon to destroy it;
JER.51.11	For it is the vengeance of the L
JER.51.12	Lift up a signal against the walls of Babylon;
JER.51.12	Post a strong guard,
JER.51.12	Station sentries,
JER.51.12	Place men in ambush!
JER.51.12	For the L
JER.51.12	What He spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.
JER.51.13	O you who dwell by many waters,
JER.51.13	Abundant in treasures,
JER.51.13	Your end has come,
JER.51.13	The measure of your end.
JER.51.14	The L
JER.51.14	“Surely I will fill you with a population like locusts,
JER.51.14	And they will cry out with shouts of victory over you.”
JER.51.15	Who established the world by His wisdom,
JER.51.15	And by His understanding He stretched out the heavens.
JER.51.16	When He utters His voice, 
JER.51.16	And He causes the clouds to ascend from the end of the earth;
JER.51.16	He makes lightning for the rain
JER.51.16	And brings forth the wind from His storehouses.
JER.51.17	All mankind is stupid, devoid of knowledge;
JER.51.17	Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols,
JER.51.17	For his molten images are deceitful,
JER.51.17	And there is no breath in them.
JER.51.18	They are worthless, a work of mockery;
JER.51.18	In the time of their punishment they will perish.
JER.51.19	The portion of Jacob is not like these;
JER.51.19	For the Maker of all is He,
JER.51.19	And of the tribe of His inheritance;
JER.51.19	The L
JER.51.20	And with you I shatter nations,
JER.51.20	And with you I destroy kingdoms.
JER.51.21	With you I shatter the horse and his rider,
JER.51.21	And with you I shatter the chariot and its rider,
JER.51.22	And with you I shatter man and woman,
JER.51.22	And with you I shatter old man and youth,
JER.51.22	And with you I shatter young man and virgin,
JER.51.23	And with you I shatter the shepherd and his flock,
JER.51.23	And with you I shatter the farmer and his team,
JER.51.23	And with you I shatter governors and prefects.
JER.51.24	“But I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all their evil that they have done in Zion before your eyes,” declares the L
JER.51.25	“Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain,
JER.51.25	Who destroys the whole earth,” declares the L
JER.51.25	“And I will stretch out My hand against you,
JER.51.25	And roll you down from the crags,
JER.51.25	And I will make you a burnt out mountain.
JER.51.26	They will not take from you 
JER.51.26	Nor a stone for foundations,
JER.51.26	But you will be desolate forever,” declares the L
JER.51.27	Lift up a signal in the land,
JER.51.27	Blow a trumpet among the nations!
JER.51.27	Consecrate the nations against her,
JER.51.27	Summon against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz;
JER.51.27	Appoint a marshal against her,
JER.51.27	Bring up the horses like bristly locusts.
JER.51.28	Consecrate the nations against her,
JER.51.28	The kings of the Medes,
JER.51.28	Their governors and all their prefects,
JER.51.28	And every land of their dominion.
JER.51.29	So the land quakes and writhes,
JER.51.29	For the purposes of the L
JER.51.29	To make the land of Babylon
JER.51.29	A desolation without inhabitants.
JER.51.30	The mighty men of Babylon have ceased fighting,
JER.51.30	They stay in the strongholds;
JER.51.30	Their strength is exhausted,
JER.51.30	They are becoming 
JER.51.30	Their dwelling places are set on fire,
JER.51.30	The bars of her 
JER.51.31	One courier runs to meet another,
JER.51.31	And one messenger to meet another,
JER.51.31	To tell the king of Babylon
JER.51.31	That his city has been captured from end 
JER.51.32	The fords also have been seized,
JER.51.32	And they have burned the marshes with fire,
JER.51.32	And the men of war are terrified.
JER.51.33	For thus says the L
JER.51.33	“The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor
JER.51.33	At the time it is stamped firm;
JER.51.33	Yet in a little while the time of harvest will come for her.”
JER.51.34	“Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured me 
JER.51.34	He has set me down 
JER.51.34	He has swallowed me like a monster,
JER.51.34	He has filled his stomach with my delicacies;
JER.51.34	He has washed me away.
JER.51.35	May the violence 
JER.51.35	The inhabitant of Zion will say;
JER.51.35	And, “May my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,”
JER.51.35	Jerusalem will say.
JER.51.36	Therefore thus says the L
JER.51.36	“Behold, I am going to plead your case
JER.51.36	And exact full vengeance for you;
JER.51.36	And I will dry up her sea
JER.51.36	And make her fountain dry.
JER.51.37	Babylon will become a heap 
JER.51.37	An object of horror and hissing, without inhabitants.
JER.51.38	They will roar together like young lions,
JER.51.38	They will growl like lions’ cubs.
JER.51.39	When they become heated up, I will serve 
JER.51.39	And make them drunk, that they may become jubilant
JER.51.39	And may sleep a perpetual sleep
JER.51.39	And not wake up,” declares the L
JER.51.40	“I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter,
JER.51.40	Like rams together with male goats.
JER.51.41	“How 
JER.51.41	And the praise of the whole earth been seized!
JER.51.41	How Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations!
JER.51.42	The sea has come up over Babylon;
JER.51.42	She has been engulfed with its tumultuous waves.
JER.51.43	Her cities have become an object of horror,
JER.51.43	A parched land and a desert,
JER.51.43	A land in which no man lives
JER.51.43	And through which no son of man passes.
JER.51.44	I will punish Bel in Babylon,
JER.51.44	And I will make what he has swallowed come out of his mouth;
JER.51.44	And the nations will no longer stream to him.
JER.51.44	Even the wall of Babylon has fallen down!
JER.51.45	“Come forth from her midst, My people,
JER.51.45	And each of you save yourselves
JER.51.45	From the fierce anger of the L
JER.51.46	Now so that your heart does not grow faint,

JER.51.46	For the report will come one year,
JER.51.46	And after that another report in another year,
JER.51.46	And violence 
JER.51.46	With ruler against ruler—
JER.51.47	Therefore behold, days are coming
JER.51.47	When I will punish the idols of Babylon;
JER.51.47	And her whole land will be put to shame
JER.51.47	And all her slain will fall in her midst.
JER.51.48	Then heaven and earth and all that is in them
JER.51.48	Will shout for joy over Babylon,
JER.51.48	For the destroyers will come to her from the north,”
JER.51.48	Declares the L
JER.51.49	Indeed Babylon is to fall 
JER.51.50	You who have escaped the sword,
JER.51.50	Depart! Do not stay!
JER.51.50	Remember the L
JER.51.50	And let Jerusalem come to your mind.
JER.51.51	We are ashamed because we have heard reproach;
JER.51.51	Disgrace has covered our faces,
JER.51.51	For aliens have entered
JER.51.51	The holy places of the L

JER.51.52	“When I will punish her idols,
JER.51.52	And the mortally wounded will groan throughout her land.
JER.51.53	Though Babylon should ascend to the heavens,
JER.51.53	And though she should fortify her lofty stronghold,
JER.51.53	From Me destroyers will come to her,” declares the L
JER.51.54	The sound of an outcry from Babylon,
JER.51.54	And of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
JER.51.55	For the L
JER.51.55	And He will make 
JER.51.55	And their waves will roar like many waters;
JER.51.55	The tumult of their voices sounds forth.
JER.51.56	For the destroyer is coming against her, against Babylon,
JER.51.56	And her mighty men will be captured,
JER.51.56	Their bows are shattered;
JER.51.56	For the L
JER.51.56	He will fully repay.
JER.51.57	“I will make her princes and her wise men drunk,
JER.51.57	Her governors, her prefects and her mighty men,
JER.51.57	That they may sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake up,”
JER.51.57	Declares the King, whose name is the L
JER.51.58	Thus says the L
JER.51.58	“The broad wall of Babylon will be completely razed
JER.51.58	And her high gates will be set on fire;
JER.51.58	So the peoples will toil for nothing,
JER.51.58	And the nations become exhausted 
JER.51.59	The message which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the grandson of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. (Now Seraiah was quartermaster.) 
JER.51.60	So Jeremiah wrote in a single scroll all the calamity which would come upon Babylon, 
JER.51.61	Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “As soon as you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words aloud, 
JER.51.62	and say, ‘You, O L
JER.51.63	And as soon as you finish reading this scroll, you will tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates, 
JER.51.64	and say, ‘Just so shall Babylon sink down and not rise again because of the calamity that I am going to bring upon her; and they will become exhausted.’ ” Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
JER.52.2	He did evil in the sight of the L
JER.52.3	For through the anger of the L
JER.52.4	Now it came about in the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth 
JER.52.5	So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. 
JER.52.6	On the ninth 
JER.52.7	Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled and went forth from the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls which 
JER.52.8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him. 
JER.52.9	Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. 
JER.52.10	The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all the princes of Judah in Riblah. 
JER.52.11	Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him with bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon and put him in prison until the day of his death.
JER.52.12	Now on the tenth 
JER.52.13	He burned the house of the L
JER.52.14	So all the army of the Chaldeans who 
JER.52.15	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away into exile some of the poorest of the people, the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon and the rest of the artisans. 
JER.52.16	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
JER.52.17	Now the bronze pillars which belonged to the house of the L
JER.52.18	They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the pans and all the bronze vessels which were used in 
JER.52.19	The captain of the guard also took away the bowls, the firepans, the basins, the pots, the lampstands, the pans and the drink offering bowls, what was fine gold and what was fine silver. 
JER.52.20	The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea, 
JER.52.21	As for the pillars, the height of each pillar 
JER.52.22	Now a capital of bronze was on it; and the height of each capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital all around, all of bronze. And the second pillar was like these, including pomegranates. 
JER.52.23	There were ninety-six exposed pomegranates; all the pomegranates 
JER.52.24	Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest, with the three officers of the temple. 
JER.52.25	He also took from the city one official who was overseer of the men of war, and seven of the king’s advisers who were found in the city, and the scribe of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city. 
JER.52.26	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
JER.52.27	Then the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was led away into exile from its land.
JER.52.28	These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away into exile: in the seventh year 3,023 Jews; 
JER.52.29	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar 832 persons from Jerusalem; 
JER.52.30	in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile 745 Jewish people; there were 4,600 persons in all.
JER.52.31	Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the 
JER.52.32	Then he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who 
JER.52.33	So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and had his meals in the king’s presence regularly all the days of his life. 
JER.52.34	For his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king of Babylon, a daily portion all the days of his life until the day of his death.
LAM.1.1	How lonely sits the city
LAM.1.1	That was full of people!
LAM.1.1	She has become like a widow
LAM.1.1	Who was 
LAM.1.1	She who was a princess among the provinces
LAM.1.1	Has become a forced laborer!
LAM.1.2	She weeps bitterly in the night
LAM.1.2	And her tears are on her cheeks;
LAM.1.2	She has none to comfort her
LAM.1.2	Among all her lovers.
LAM.1.2	All her friends have dealt treacherously with her;
LAM.1.2	They have become her enemies.
LAM.1.3	Judah has gone into exile under affliction
LAM.1.3	And under harsh servitude;
LAM.1.3	She dwells among the nations,
LAM.1.3	All her pursuers have overtaken her
LAM.1.3	In the midst of distress.
LAM.1.4	The roads of Zion are in mourning
LAM.1.4	Because no one comes to the appointed feasts.
LAM.1.4	All her gates are desolate;
LAM.1.4	Her priests are groaning,
LAM.1.4	Her virgins are afflicted,
LAM.1.4	And she herself is bitter.
LAM.1.5	Her adversaries have become her masters,
LAM.1.5	Her enemies prosper;
LAM.1.5	For the L
LAM.1.5	Because of the multitude of her transgressions;
LAM.1.5	Her little ones have gone away
LAM.1.5	As captives before the adversary.
LAM.1.6	All her majesty
LAM.1.6	Has departed from the daughter of Zion;
LAM.1.6	Her princes have become like deer
LAM.1.6	That have found no pasture;
LAM.1.6	And they have fled without strength
LAM.1.6	Before the pursuer.
LAM.1.7	In the days of her affliction and homelessness
LAM.1.7	Jerusalem remembers all her precious things
LAM.1.7	That were from the days of old,
LAM.1.7	When her people fell into the hand of the adversary
LAM.1.7	And no one helped her.
LAM.1.7	The adversaries saw her,
LAM.1.7	They mocked at her ruin.
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem sinned greatly,
LAM.1.8	Therefore she has become an unclean thing.
LAM.1.8	All who honored her despise her
LAM.1.8	Because they have seen her nakedness;
LAM.1.8	Even she herself groans and turns away.
LAM.1.9	Her uncleanness was in her skirts;
LAM.1.9	She did not consider her future.
LAM.1.9	Therefore she has fallen astonishingly;
LAM.1.9	She has no comforter.
LAM.1.9	“See, O L
LAM.1.9	For the enemy has magnified himself!”
LAM.1.10	The adversary has stretched out his hand
LAM.1.10	Over all her precious things,
LAM.1.10	For she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary,
LAM.1.10	The ones whom You commanded
LAM.1.10	That they should not enter into Your congregation.
LAM.1.11	All her people groan seeking bread;
LAM.1.11	They have given their precious things for food
LAM.1.11	To restore their lives themselves.
LAM.1.11	“See, O L
LAM.1.11	For I am despised.”
LAM.1.12	“Is it nothing to all you who pass this way?
LAM.1.12	Look and see if there is any pain like my pain
LAM.1.12	Which was severely dealt out to me,
LAM.1.12	Which the L

LAM.1.13	And it prevailed 
LAM.1.13	He has spread a net for my feet;
LAM.1.13	He has turned me back;
LAM.1.13	He has made me desolate,
LAM.1.13	Faint all day long.
LAM.1.14	The yoke of my transgressions is bound;
LAM.1.14	By His hand they are knit together.
LAM.1.14	They have come upon my neck;
LAM.1.14	He has made my strength fail.
LAM.1.14	The Lord has given me into the hands
LAM.1.14	Of

LAM.1.15	In my midst;
LAM.1.15	He has called an appointed time against me
LAM.1.15	To crush my young men;
LAM.1.15	The Lord has trodden 
LAM.1.15	The virgin daughter of Judah.
LAM.1.16	For these things I weep;
LAM.1.16	My eyes run down with water;
LAM.1.16	Because far from me is a comforter,
LAM.1.16	One who restores my soul.
LAM.1.16	My children are desolate
LAM.1.16	Because the enemy has prevailed.”
LAM.1.17	Zion stretches out her hands;
LAM.1.17	There is no one to comfort her;
LAM.1.17	The L
LAM.1.17	That the ones round about him should be his adversaries;
LAM.1.17	Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.
LAM.1.18	“The L
LAM.1.18	For I have rebelled against His command;
LAM.1.18	Hear now, all peoples,
LAM.1.18	And behold my pain;
LAM.1.18	My virgins and my young men
LAM.1.18	Have gone into captivity.
LAM.1.19	I called to my lovers, 
LAM.1.19	My priests and my elders perished in the city
LAM.1.19	While they sought food to restore their strength themselves.
LAM.1.20	See, O L
LAM.1.20	My spirit is greatly troubled;
LAM.1.20	My heart is overturned within me,
LAM.1.20	For I have been very rebellious.
LAM.1.20	In the street the sword slays;
LAM.1.20	In the house it is like death.
LAM.1.21	They have heard that I groan;
LAM.1.21	There is no one to comfort me;
LAM.1.21	All my enemies have heard of my calamity;
LAM.1.21	They are glad that You have done 
LAM.1.21	Oh, that You would bring the day which You have proclaimed,
LAM.1.21	That they may become like me.
LAM.1.22	Let all their wickedness come before You;
LAM.1.22	And deal with them as You have dealt with me
LAM.1.22	For all my transgressions;
LAM.1.22	For my groans are many and my heart is faint.”
LAM.2.1	How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion
LAM.2.1	With a cloud in His anger!
LAM.2.1	He has cast from heaven to earth
LAM.2.1	The glory of Israel,
LAM.2.1	And has not remembered His footstool
LAM.2.1	In the day of His anger.
LAM.2.2	The Lord has swallowed up; He has not spared
LAM.2.2	All the habitations of Jacob.
LAM.2.2	In His wrath He has thrown down
LAM.2.2	The strongholds of the daughter of Judah;
LAM.2.2	He has brought 
LAM.2.2	He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.
LAM.2.3	In fierce anger He has cut off
LAM.2.3	All the strength of Israel;
LAM.2.3	He has drawn back His right hand
LAM.2.3	From before the enemy.
LAM.2.3	And He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire
LAM.2.3	Consuming round about.
LAM.2.4	He has bent His bow like an enemy;
LAM.2.4	He has set His right hand like an adversary
LAM.2.4	And slain all that were pleasant to the eye;
LAM.2.4	In the tent of the daughter of Zion
LAM.2.4	He has poured out His wrath like fire.
LAM.2.5	The Lord has become like an enemy.
LAM.2.5	He has swallowed up Israel;
LAM.2.5	He has swallowed up all its palaces,
LAM.2.5	He has destroyed its strongholds
LAM.2.5	And multiplied in the daughter of Judah
LAM.2.5	Mourning and moaning.
LAM.2.6	And He has violently treated His tabernacle like a garden 
LAM.2.6	He has destroyed His appointed meeting place.
LAM.2.6	The L
LAM.2.6	The appointed feast and sabbath in Zion,
LAM.2.6	And He has despised king and priest
LAM.2.6	In the indignation of His anger.
LAM.2.7	The Lord has rejected His altar,
LAM.2.7	He has abandoned His sanctuary;
LAM.2.7	He has delivered into the hand of the enemy
LAM.2.7	The walls of her palaces.
LAM.2.7	They have made a noise in the house of the L
LAM.2.7	As in the day of an appointed feast.
LAM.2.8	The L
LAM.2.8	The wall of the daughter of Zion.
LAM.2.8	He has stretched out a line,
LAM.2.8	He has not restrained His hand from destroying,
LAM.2.8	And He has caused rampart and wall to lament;
LAM.2.8	They have languished together.
LAM.2.9	Her gates have sunk into the ground,
LAM.2.9	He has destroyed and broken her bars.
LAM.2.9	Her king and her princes are among the nations;
LAM.2.9	The law is no more.
LAM.2.9	Also, her prophets find
LAM.2.9	No vision from the L
LAM.2.10	The elders of the daughter of Zion
LAM.2.10	Sit on the ground, they are silent.
LAM.2.10	They have thrown dust on their heads;
LAM.2.10	They have girded themselves with sackcloth.
LAM.2.10	The virgins of Jerusalem
LAM.2.10	Have bowed their heads to the ground.
LAM.2.11	My eyes fail because of tears,
LAM.2.11	My spirit is greatly troubled;
LAM.2.11	My heart is poured out on the earth
LAM.2.11	Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,
LAM.2.11	When little ones and infants faint
LAM.2.11	In the streets of the city.
LAM.2.12	They say to their mothers,
LAM.2.12	“Where is grain and wine?”
LAM.2.12	As they faint like a wounded man
LAM.2.12	In the streets of the city,
LAM.2.12	As their life is poured out
LAM.2.12	On their mothers’ bosom.
LAM.2.13	How shall I admonish you?
LAM.2.13	To what shall I compare you,
LAM.2.13	O daughter of Jerusalem?
LAM.2.13	To what shall I liken you as I comfort you,
LAM.2.13	O virgin daughter of Zion?
LAM.2.13	For your ruin is as vast as the sea;
LAM.2.13	Who can heal you?
LAM.2.14	Your prophets have seen for you
LAM.2.14	False and foolish 
LAM.2.14	And they have not exposed your iniquity
LAM.2.14	So as to restore you from captivity,
LAM.2.14	But they have seen for you false and misleading oracles.
LAM.2.15	All who pass along the way
LAM.2.15	Clap their hands 
LAM.2.15	They hiss and shake their heads
LAM.2.15	At the daughter of Jerusalem,
LAM.2.15	“Is this the city of which they said,
LAM.2.15	‘The perfection of beauty,
LAM.2.15	A joy to all the earth’?”
LAM.2.16	All your enemies
LAM.2.16	Have opened their mouths wide against you;
LAM.2.16	They hiss and gnash 
LAM.2.16	They say, “We have swallowed 
LAM.2.16	Surely this is the day for which we waited;
LAM.2.16	We have reached 
LAM.2.17	The L
LAM.2.17	He has accomplished His word
LAM.2.17	Which He commanded from days of old.
LAM.2.17	He has thrown down without sparing,
LAM.2.17	And He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you;
LAM.2.17	He has exalted the might of your adversaries.
LAM.2.18	Their heart cried out to the Lord,
LAM.2.18	“O wall of the daughter of Zion,
LAM.2.18	Let 
LAM.2.18	Give yourself no relief,
LAM.2.18	Let your eyes have no rest.
LAM.2.19	Arise, cry aloud in the night
LAM.2.19	At the beginning of the night watches;
LAM.2.19	Pour out your heart like water
LAM.2.19	Before the presence of the Lord;
LAM.2.19	Lift up your hands to Him
LAM.2.19	For the life of your little ones
LAM.2.19	Who are faint because of hunger
LAM.2.19	At the head of every street.”
LAM.2.20	See, O L
LAM.2.20	With whom have You dealt thus?
LAM.2.20	Should women eat their offspring,
LAM.2.20	The little ones who were born healthy?
LAM.2.20	Should priest and prophet be slain
LAM.2.20	In the sanctuary of the Lord?
LAM.2.21	On the ground in the streets
LAM.2.21	Lie young and old;
LAM.2.21	My virgins and my young men
LAM.2.21	Have fallen by the sword.
LAM.2.21	You have slain 
LAM.2.21	You have slaughtered, not sparing.
LAM.2.22	You called as in the day of an appointed feast
LAM.2.22	My terrors on every side;
LAM.2.22	And there was no one who escaped or survived
LAM.2.22	In the day of the L
LAM.2.22	Those whom I bore and reared,
LAM.2.22	My enemy annihilated them.
LAM.3.1	I am the man who has seen affliction
LAM.3.1	Because of the rod of His wrath.
LAM.3.2	He has driven me and made me walk
LAM.3.2	In darkness and not in light.
LAM.3.3	Surely against me He has turned His hand
LAM.3.3	Repeatedly all the day.
LAM.3.4	He has caused my flesh and my skin to waste away,
LAM.3.4	He has broken my bones.
LAM.3.5	He has besieged and encompassed me with bitterness and hardship.
LAM.3.6	In dark places He has made me dwell,
LAM.3.6	Like those who have long been dead.
LAM.3.7	He has walled me in so that I cannot go out;
LAM.3.7	He has made my chain heavy.
LAM.3.8	Even when I cry out and call for help,
LAM.3.8	He shuts out my prayer.
LAM.3.9	He has blocked my ways with hewn stone;
LAM.3.9	He has made my paths crooked.
LAM.3.10	He is to me like a bear lying in wait,
LAM.3.11	He has turned aside my ways and torn me to pieces;
LAM.3.11	He has made me desolate.
LAM.3.12	He bent His bow
LAM.3.12	And set me as a target for the arrow.
LAM.3.13	He made the arrows of His quiver
LAM.3.13	To enter into my inward parts.
LAM.3.14	I have become a laughingstock to all my people,
LAM.3.14	Their 
LAM.3.15	He has filled me with bitterness,
LAM.3.15	He has made me drunk with wormwood.
LAM.3.16	He has broken my teeth with gravel;
LAM.3.16	He has made me cower in the dust.
LAM.3.17	My soul has been rejected from peace;
LAM.3.17	I have forgotten happiness.
LAM.3.18	So I say, “My strength has perished,
LAM.3.18	And 
LAM.3.19	Remember my affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and bitterness.
LAM.3.20	Surely my soul remembers
LAM.3.20	And is bowed down within me.
LAM.3.21	This I recall to my mind,
LAM.3.21	Therefore I have hope.
LAM.3.22	The L
LAM.3.22	For His compassions never fail.
LAM.3.23	Great is Your faithfulness.
LAM.3.24	“The L
LAM.3.24	“Therefore I have hope in Him.”
LAM.3.25	The L
LAM.3.25	To the person who seeks Him.
LAM.3.26	For the salvation of the L
LAM.3.27	The yoke in his youth.
LAM.3.28	Let him sit alone and be silent
LAM.3.28	Since He has laid 
LAM.3.29	Let him put his mouth in the dust,
LAM.3.29	Perhaps there is hope.
LAM.3.30	Let him give his cheek to the smiter,
LAM.3.30	Let him be filled with reproach.
LAM.3.31	For the Lord will not reject forever,
LAM.3.32	For if He causes grief,
LAM.3.32	Then He will have compassion
LAM.3.32	According to His abundant lovingkindness.
LAM.3.33	For He does not afflict willingly
LAM.3.33	Or grieve the sons of men.
LAM.3.34	To crush under His feet
LAM.3.34	All the prisoners of the land,
LAM.3.35	To deprive a man of justice
LAM.3.35	In the presence of the Most High,
LAM.3.36	To defraud a man in his lawsuit—
LAM.3.36	Of these things the Lord does not approve.
LAM.3.37	Who is there who speaks and it comes to pass,
LAM.3.37	Unless the Lord has commanded 
LAM.3.38	That both good and ill go forth?
LAM.3.39	Why should 
LAM.3.39	Offer complaint in view of his sins?
LAM.3.40	Let us examine and probe our ways,
LAM.3.40	And let us return to the L
LAM.3.41	We lift up our heart and hands
LAM.3.41	Toward God in heaven;
LAM.3.42	We have transgressed and rebelled,
LAM.3.42	You have not pardoned.
LAM.3.43	You have covered 
LAM.3.43	And pursued us;
LAM.3.43	You have slain 
LAM.3.44	You have covered Yourself with a cloud
LAM.3.44	So that no prayer can pass through.
LAM.3.45	In the midst of the peoples.
LAM.3.46	All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
LAM.3.47	Panic and pitfall have befallen us,
LAM.3.47	Devastation and destruction;
LAM.3.48	My eyes run down with streams of water
LAM.3.48	Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LAM.3.49	My eyes pour down unceasingly,
LAM.3.49	Without stopping,
LAM.3.50	Until the L
LAM.3.50	And sees from heaven.
LAM.3.51	My eyes bring pain to my soul
LAM.3.51	Because of all the daughters of my city.
LAM.3.52	My enemies without cause
LAM.3.52	Hunted me down like a bird;
LAM.3.53	They have silenced me in the pit
LAM.3.53	And have placed a stone on me.
LAM.3.54	Waters flowed over my head;
LAM.3.54	I said, “I am cut off!”
LAM.3.55	I called on Your name, O L
LAM.3.55	Out of the lowest pit.
LAM.3.56	You have heard my voice,
LAM.3.56	“Do not hide Your ear from my 
LAM.3.56	From my cry for help.”
LAM.3.57	You drew near when I called on You;
LAM.3.57	You said, “Do not fear!”
LAM.3.58	O Lord, You have pleaded my soul’s cause;
LAM.3.58	You have redeemed my life.
LAM.3.59	O L
LAM.3.59	Judge my case.
LAM.3.60	You have seen all their vengeance,
LAM.3.60	All their schemes against me.
LAM.3.61	You have heard their reproach, O L
LAM.3.61	All their schemes against me.
LAM.3.62	The lips of my assailants and their whispering
LAM.3.63	Look on their sitting and their rising;
LAM.3.63	I am their mocking song.
LAM.3.64	You will recompense them, O L
LAM.3.64	According to the work of their hands.
LAM.3.65	You will give them hardness of heart,
LAM.3.65	Your curse will be on them.
LAM.3.66	You will pursue them in anger and destroy them
LAM.3.66	From under the heavens of the L
LAM.4.1	How dark the gold has become,
LAM.4.1	The sacred stones are poured out
LAM.4.1	At the corner of every street.
LAM.4.2	The precious sons of Zion,
LAM.4.2	Weighed against fine gold,
LAM.4.2	How they are regarded as earthen jars,
LAM.4.2	The work of a potter’s hands!
LAM.4.3	Even jackals offer the breast,
LAM.4.3	They nurse their young;
LAM.4.3	Like ostriches in the wilderness.
LAM.4.4	The tongue of the infant cleaves
LAM.4.4	To the roof of its mouth because of thirst;
LAM.4.4	The little ones ask for bread,
LAM.4.5	Those who ate delicacies
LAM.4.5	Are desolate in the streets;
LAM.4.5	Those reared in purple
LAM.4.5	Embrace ash pits.
LAM.4.6	For the iniquity of the daughter of my people
LAM.4.6	Is greater than the sin of Sodom,
LAM.4.6	Which was overthrown as in a moment,
LAM.4.6	And no hands were turned toward her.
LAM.4.7	Her consecrated ones were purer than snow,
LAM.4.7	They were whiter than milk;
LAM.4.7	They were more ruddy 
LAM.4.7	Their polishing 
LAM.4.8	Their appearance is blacker than soot,
LAM.4.8	They are not recognized in the streets;
LAM.4.8	Their skin is shriveled on their bones,
LAM.4.8	It is withered, it has become like wood.
LAM.4.9	Better are those slain with the sword
LAM.4.9	Than those slain with hunger;
LAM.4.9	For they pine away, being stricken
LAM.4.9	For lack of the fruits of the field.
LAM.4.10	The hands of compassionate women
LAM.4.10	Boiled their own children;
LAM.4.10	They became food for them
LAM.4.10	Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LAM.4.11	The L
LAM.4.11	He has poured out His fierce anger;
LAM.4.11	And He has kindled a fire in Zion
LAM.4.11	Which has consumed its foundations.
LAM.4.12	The kings of the earth did not believe,
LAM.4.12	Nor 
LAM.4.12	That the adversary and the enemy
LAM.4.12	Could enter the gates of Jerusalem.
LAM.4.13	Because of the sins of her prophets
LAM.4.13	Who have shed in her midst
LAM.4.13	The blood of the righteous;
LAM.4.14	They wandered, blind, in the streets;
LAM.4.14	They were defiled with blood
LAM.4.14	So that no one could touch their garments.
LAM.4.15	“Depart! Unclean!” they cried of themselves.
LAM.4.15	“Depart, depart, do not touch!”
LAM.4.15	So they fled and wandered;
LAM.4.15	“They shall not continue to dwell 
LAM.4.16	The presence of the L
LAM.4.16	He will not continue to regard them;
LAM.4.16	They did not honor the priests,
LAM.4.16	They did not favor the elders.
LAM.4.17	Yet our eyes failed,
LAM.4.17	In our watching we have watched
LAM.4.17	For a nation that could not save.
LAM.4.18	They hunted our steps
LAM.4.18	So that we could not walk in our streets;
LAM.4.18	Our end drew near,
LAM.4.18	Our days were finished
LAM.4.18	For our end had come.
LAM.4.19	Our pursuers were swifter
LAM.4.19	Than the eagles of the sky;
LAM.4.19	They chased us on the mountains,
LAM.4.19	They waited in ambush for us in the wilderness.
LAM.4.20	The breath of our nostrils, the L
LAM.4.20	Was captured in their pits,
LAM.4.20	Of whom we had said, “Under his shadow
LAM.4.20	We shall live among the nations.”
LAM.4.21	Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom,
LAM.4.21	Who dwells in the land of Uz;
LAM.4.21	You will become drunk and make yourself naked.
LAM.4.22	He will exile you no longer.
LAM.4.22	He will expose your sins!
LAM.5.1	Remember, O L
LAM.5.1	Look, and see our reproach!
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,
LAM.5.2	Our houses to aliens.
LAM.5.3	We have become orphans without a father,
LAM.5.3	Our mothers are like widows.
LAM.5.4	We have to pay for our drinking water,
LAM.5.4	Our wood comes 
LAM.5.5	Our pursuers are at our necks;
LAM.5.5	We are worn out, there is no rest for us.
LAM.5.6	We have submitted to Egypt 
LAM.5.7	Our fathers sinned, 
LAM.5.7	It is we who have borne their iniquities.
LAM.5.8	Slaves rule over us;
LAM.5.8	There is no one to deliver us from their hand.
LAM.5.9	We get our bread at the risk of our lives
LAM.5.9	Because of the sword in the wilderness.
LAM.5.10	Our skin has become as hot as an oven,
LAM.5.10	Because of the burning heat of famine.
LAM.5.11	They ravished the women in Zion,
LAM.5.11	The virgins in the cities of Judah.
LAM.5.12	Princes were hung by their hands;
LAM.5.12	Elders were not respected.
LAM.5.13	Young men worked at the grinding mill,
LAM.5.13	And youths stumbled under 
LAM.5.14	Elders are gone from the gate,
LAM.5.14	Young men from their music.
LAM.5.15	The joy of our hearts has ceased;
LAM.5.15	Our dancing has been turned into mourning.
LAM.5.16	The crown has fallen from our head;
LAM.5.16	Woe to us, for we have sinned!
LAM.5.17	Because of this our heart is faint,
LAM.5.17	Because of these things our eyes are dim;
LAM.5.18	Because of Mount Zion which lies desolate,
LAM.5.18	Foxes prowl in it.
LAM.5.19	You, O L
LAM.5.19	Your throne is from generation to generation.
LAM.5.20	Why do You forget us forever?
LAM.5.20	Why do You forsake us so long?
LAM.5.21	Restore us to You, O L
LAM.5.21	Renew our days as of old,
LAM.5.22	Unless You have utterly rejected us
EZK.1.1	Now it came about in the thirtieth year, on the fifth 
EZK.1.2	(On the fifth of the month in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s exile, 
EZK.1.3	the word of the L
EZK.1.4	As I looked, behold, a storm wind was coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing forth continually and a bright light around it, and in its midst something like glowing metal in the midst of the fire. 
EZK.1.5	Within it there were figures resembling four living beings. And this was their appearance: they had human form. 
EZK.1.6	Each of them had four faces and four wings. 
EZK.1.7	Their legs were straight and their feet were like a calf’s hoof, and they gleamed like burnished bronze. 
EZK.1.8	Under their wings on their four sides 
EZK.1.9	their wings touched one another; 
EZK.1.10	As for the form of their faces, 
EZK.1.11	Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each had two touching another 
EZK.1.12	And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go, without turning as they went. 
EZK.1.13	In the midst of the living beings there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches darting back and forth among the living beings. The fire was bright, and lightning was flashing from the fire. 
EZK.1.14	And the living beings ran to and fro like bolts of lightning.
EZK.1.15	Now as I looked at the living beings, behold, there was one wheel on the earth beside the living beings, for 
EZK.1.16	The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship 
EZK.1.17	Whenever they moved, they moved in any of their four directions without turning as they moved. 
EZK.1.18	As for their rims they were lofty and awesome, and the rims of all four of them were full of eyes round about. 
EZK.1.19	Whenever the living beings moved, the wheels moved with them. And whenever the living beings rose from the earth, the wheels rose 
EZK.1.20	Wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go in that direction. And the wheels rose close beside them; for the spirit of the living beings 
EZK.1.21	Whenever those went, these went; and whenever those stood still, these stood still. And whenever those rose from the earth, the wheels rose close beside them; for the spirit of the living beings 
EZK.1.22	Now over the heads of the living beings 
EZK.1.23	Under the expanse their wings 
EZK.1.24	I also heard the sound of their wings like the sound of abundant waters as they went, like the voice of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army camp; whenever they stood still, they dropped their wings. 
EZK.1.25	And there came a voice from above the expanse that was over their heads; whenever they stood still, they dropped their wings.
EZK.1.26	Now above the expanse that was over their heads there was something resembling a throne, like lapis lazuli in appearance; and on that which resembled a throne, high up, 
EZK.1.27	Then I noticed from the appearance of His loins and upward something like glowing metal that looked like fire all around within it, and from the appearance of His loins and downward I saw something like fire; and 
EZK.1.28	As the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so 
EZK.2.1	Then He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet that I may speak with you!” 
EZK.2.2	As He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I heard 
EZK.2.3	Then He said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious people who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day. 
EZK.2.4	I am sending you to them who are stubborn and obstinate children, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.2.5	As for them, whether they listen or not—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet has been among them. 
EZK.2.6	And you, son of man, neither fear them nor fear their words, though thistles and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions; neither fear their words nor be dismayed at their presence, for they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.2.7	But you shall speak My words to them whether they listen or not, for they are rebellious.
EZK.2.8	“Now you, son of man, listen to what I am speaking to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.” 
EZK.2.9	Then I looked, and behold, a hand was extended to me; and lo, a scroll 
EZK.2.10	When He spread it out before me, it was written on the front and back, and written on it were lamentations, mourning and woe.
EZK.3.1	Then He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.” 
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and He fed me this scroll. 
EZK.3.3	He said to me, “Son of man, feed your stomach and fill your body with this scroll which I am giving you.” Then I ate it, and it was sweet as honey in my mouth.
EZK.3.4	Then He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with My words to them. 
EZK.3.5	For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or difficult language, 
EZK.3.6	nor to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. But I have sent you to them who should listen to you; 
EZK.3.7	yet the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, since they are not willing to listen to Me. Surely the whole house of Israel is stubborn and obstinate. 
EZK.3.8	Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. 
EZK.3.9	Like emery harder than flint I have made your forehead. Do not be afraid of them or be dismayed before them, though they are a rebellious house.” 
EZK.3.10	Moreover, He said to me, “Son of man, take into your heart all My words which I will speak to you and listen closely. 
EZK.3.11	Go to the exiles, to the sons of your people, and speak to them and tell them, whether they listen or not, ‘Thus says the Lord G

EZK.3.15	Then I came to the exiles who lived beside the river Chebar at Tel-abib, and I sat there seven days where they were living, causing consternation among them.
EZK.3.16	At the end of seven days the word of the L
EZK.3.17	“Son of man, I have appointed you a watchman to the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from My mouth, warn them from Me. 
EZK.3.18	When I say to the wicked, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn him or speak out to warn the wicked from his wicked way that he may live, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. 
EZK.3.19	Yet if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered yourself. 
EZK.3.20	Again, when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I place an obstacle before him, he will die; since you have not warned him, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand. 
EZK.3.21	However, if you have warned the righteous man that the righteous should not sin and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he took warning; and you have delivered yourself.”

EZK.3.24	The Spirit then entered me and made me stand on my feet, and He spoke with me and said to me, “Go, shut yourself up in your house. 
EZK.3.25	As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and bind you with them so that you cannot go out among them. 
EZK.3.26	Moreover, I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be mute and cannot be a man who rebukes them, for they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.3.27	But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you will say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.4.1	“Now you son of man, get yourself a brick, place it before you and inscribe a city on it, Jerusalem. 
EZK.4.2	Then lay siege against it, build a siege wall, raise up a ramp, pitch camps and place battering rams against it all around. 
EZK.4.3	Then get yourself an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between you and the city, and set your face toward it so that it is under siege, and besiege it. This is a sign to the house of Israel.
EZK.4.4	“As for you, lie down on your left side and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; you shall bear their iniquity for the number of days that you lie on it. 
EZK.4.5	For I have assigned you a number of days corresponding to the years of their iniquity, three hundred and ninety days; thus you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 
EZK.4.6	When you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, 
EZK.4.7	Then you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared and prophesy against it. 
EZK.4.8	Now behold, I will put ropes on you so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege.
EZK.4.9	“But as for you, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet and spelt, put them in one vessel and make them into bread for yourself; you shall eat it according to the number of the days that you lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days. 
EZK.4.10	Your food which you eat 
EZK.4.11	The water you drink shall be the sixth part of a hin by measure; you shall drink it from time to time. 
EZK.4.12	You shall eat it as a barley cake, having baked

EZK.4.15	Then He said to me, “See, I will give you cow’s dung in place of human dung over which you will prepare your bread.” 
EZK.4.16	Moreover, He said to me, “Son of man, behold, I am going to break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they will eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and drink water by measure and in horror, 
EZK.4.17	because bread and water will be scarce; and they will be appalled with one another and waste away in their iniquity.
EZK.5.1	“As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword; take and use it

EZK.8.2	Then I looked, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of a man; from His loins and downward 
EZK.8.3	He stretched out the form of a hand and caught me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner 
EZK.8.4	And behold, the glory of the God of Israel 
EZK.8.5	Then He said to me, “Son of man, raise your eyes now toward the north.” So I raised my eyes toward the north, and behold, to the north of the altar gate 
EZK.8.6	And He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations which the house of Israel are committing here, so that I would be far from My sanctuary? But yet you will see still greater abominations.”
EZK.8.7	Then He brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall. 
EZK.8.8	He said to me, “Son of man, now dig through the wall.” So I dug through the wall, and behold, an entrance. 
EZK.8.9	And He said to me, “Go in and see the wicked abominations that they are committing here.” 
EZK.8.10	So I entered and looked, and behold, every form of creeping things and beasts 
EZK.8.11	Standing in front of them were seventy elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them, each man with his censer in his hand and the fragrance of the cloud of incense rising.

EZK.9.1	Then He cried out in my hearing with a loud voice saying, “Draw near, O executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand.” 
EZK.9.2	Behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate which faces north, each with his shattering weapon in his hand; and among them was a certain man clothed in linen with a writing case at his loins. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
EZK.9.3	Then the glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub on which it had been, to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed in linen at whose loins was the writing case. 
EZK.9.4	The L

EZK.9.11	Then behold, the man clothed in linen at whose loins was the writing case reported, saying, “I have done just as You have commanded me.”
EZK.10.1	Then I looked, and behold, in the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim something like a sapphire stone, in appearance resembling a throne, appeared above them. 
EZK.10.2	And He spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, “Enter between the whirling wheels under the cherubim and fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim and scatter

EZK.10.4	Then the glory of the L
EZK.10.5	Moreover, the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks.
EZK.10.6	It came about when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” he entered and stood beside a wheel. 
EZK.10.7	Then the cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire which was between the cherubim, took 
EZK.10.8	The cherubim appeared to have the form of a man’s hand under their wings.
EZK.10.9	Then I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels 
EZK.10.10	As for their appearance, all four of them had the same likeness, as if one wheel were within another wheel. 
EZK.10.11	When they moved, they went in 
EZK.10.12	Their whole body, their backs, their hands, their wings and the wheels were full of eyes all around, the wheels belonging to all four of them. 
EZK.10.13	The wheels were called in my hearing, the whirling wheels. 
EZK.10.14	And each one had four faces. The first face 
EZK.10.15	Then the cherubim rose up. They are the living beings that I saw by the river Chebar. 
EZK.10.16	Now when the cherubim moved, the wheels would go beside them; also when the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels would not turn from beside them. 
EZK.10.17	When the cherubim stood still, the wheels would stand still; and when they rose up, the wheels would rise with them, for the spirit of the living beings 
EZK.10.18	Then the glory of the L
EZK.10.19	When the cherubim departed, they lifted their wings and rose up from the earth in my sight with the wheels beside them; and they stood still at the entrance of the east gate of the L
EZK.10.20	These are the living beings that I saw beneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar; so I knew that they 
EZK.10.21	Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and beneath their wings 
EZK.10.22	As for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the river Chebar. Each one went straight ahead.
EZK.11.1	Moreover, the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the L
EZK.11.2	He said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and give evil advice in this city,

EZK.11.6	You have multiplied your slain in this city, filling its streets with them.” 
EZK.11.7	Therefore, thus says the Lord G
EZK.11.8	You have feared a sword; so I will bring a sword upon you,” the Lord G
EZK.11.9	“And I will bring you out of the midst of the city and deliver you into the hands of strangers and execute judgments against you. 
EZK.11.10	You will fall by the sword. I will judge you to the border of Israel; so you shall know that I am the L

EZK.11.19	And I will give them one heart, and put a new spirit within them. And I will take the heart of stone out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, 
EZK.11.20	that they may walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances and do them. Then they will be My people, and I shall be their God.

EZK.11.23	The glory of the L
EZK.11.24	And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God to the exiles in Chaldea. So the vision that I had seen left me. 
EZK.11.25	Then I told the exiles all the things that the L

EZK.12.3	Therefore, son of man, prepare for yourself baggage for exile and go into exile by day in their sight; even go into exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand though they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.12.4	Bring your baggage out by day in their sight, as baggage for exile. Then you will go out at evening in their sight, as those going into exile. 
EZK.12.5	Dig a hole through the wall in their sight and go out through it. 
EZK.12.6	Load 
EZK.12.7	I did so, as I had been commanded. By day I brought out my baggage like the baggage of an exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands; I went out in the dark 
EZK.12.8	In the morning the word of the L
EZK.12.9	“Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’ 
EZK.12.10	Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord G

EZK.12.13	I will also spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. And I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there. 
EZK.12.14	I will scatter to every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops; and I will draw out a sword after them. 
EZK.12.15	So they will know that I am the L
EZK.12.16	But I will spare a few of them from the sword, the famine and the pestilence that they may tell all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the L

EZK.14.13	“Son of man, if a country sins against Me by committing unfaithfulness, and I stretch out My hand against it, destroy its supply of bread, send famine against it and cut off from it both man and beast, 
EZK.14.14	even 
EZK.14.15	“If I were to cause wild beasts to pass through the land and they depopulated it, and it became desolate so that no one would pass through it because of the beasts, 
EZK.14.16	 these three men were in its midst, as I live,” declares the Lord G
EZK.14.17	Or 
EZK.14.18	even 
EZK.14.19	Or 
EZK.14.20	even 
EZK.14.21	For thus says the Lord G
EZK.14.22	Yet, behold, survivors will be left in it who will be brought out, 
EZK.14.23	Then they will comfort you when you see their conduct and actions, for you will know that I have not done in vain whatever I did to it,” declares the Lord G
EZK.15.1	Then the word of the L
EZK.15.2	“Son of man, how is the wood of the vine 
EZK.15.3	Can wood be taken from it to make anything, or can 
EZK.15.4	If it has been put into the fire for fuel, 
EZK.15.5	Behold, while it is intact, it is not made into anything. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it still be made into anything! 
EZK.15.6	Therefore, thus says the Lord G
EZK.15.7	and I set My face against them. 
EZK.15.8	Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have acted unfaithfully,’ ” declares the Lord G
EZK.16.1	Then the word of the L
EZK.16.2	“Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations 
EZK.16.3	and say, ‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.16.4	As for your birth, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water for cleansing; you were not rubbed with salt or even wrapped in cloths. 
EZK.16.5	No eye looked with pity on you to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you. Rather you were thrown out into the open field, for you were abhorred on the day you were born.
EZK.16.6	“When I passed by you and saw you squirming in your blood, I said to you 
EZK.16.7	I made you numerous like plants of the field. Then you grew up, became tall and reached the age for fine ornaments; 
EZK.16.8	“Then I passed by you and saw you, and behold, you were at the time for love; so I spread My skirt over you and covered your nakedness. I also swore to you and entered into a covenant with you so that you became Mine,” declares the Lord G
EZK.16.9	“Then I bathed you with water, washed off your blood from you and anointed you with oil. 
EZK.16.10	I also clothed you with embroidered cloth and put sandals of porpoise skin on your feet; and I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with silk. 
EZK.16.11	I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your hands and a necklace around your neck. 
EZK.16.12	I also put a ring in your nostril, earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head. 
EZK.16.13	Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your dress was of fine linen, silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey and oil; so you were exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty. 
EZK.16.14	Then your fame went forth among the nations on account of your beauty, for it was perfect because of My splendor which I bestowed on you,” declares the Lord G
EZK.16.15	“But you trusted in your beauty and played the harlot because of your fame, and you poured out your harlotries on every passer-by who might be 
EZK.16.16	You took some of your clothes, made for yourself high places of various colors and played the harlot on them, which should never come about nor happen. 
EZK.16.17	You also took your beautiful jewels 
EZK.16.18	Then you took your embroidered cloth and covered them, and offered My oil and My incense before them. 
EZK.16.19	Also My bread which I gave you, fine flour, oil and honey with which I fed you, you would offer before them for a soothing aroma; so it happened,” declares the Lord G
EZK.16.20	“Moreover, you took your sons and daughters whom you had borne to Me and sacrificed them to idols to be devoured. Were your harlotries so small a matter? 
EZK.16.21	You slaughtered My children and offered them up to idols by causing them to pass through 
EZK.16.22	Besides all your abominations and harlotries you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare and squirming in your blood.
EZK.16.23	“Then it came about after all your wickedness (‘Woe, woe to you!’ declares the Lord G
EZK.16.24	that you built yourself a shrine and made yourself a high place in every square. 
EZK.16.25	You built yourself a high place at the top of every street and made your beauty abominable, and you spread your legs to every passer-by to multiply your harlotry. 
EZK.16.26	You also played the harlot with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and multiplied your harlotry to make Me angry. 
EZK.16.27	Behold now, I have stretched out My hand against you and diminished your rations. And I delivered you up to the desire of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd conduct. 
EZK.16.28	Moreover, you played the harlot with the Assyrians because you were not satisfied; you played the harlot with them and still were not satisfied. 
EZK.16.29	You also multiplied your harlotry with the land of merchants, Chaldea, yet even with this you were not satisfied.” ’ ”
EZK.16.30	“How languishing is your heart,” declares the Lord G
EZK.16.31	When you built your shrine at the beginning of every street and made your high place in every square, in disdaining money, you were not like a harlot. 
EZK.16.32	You adulteress wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband! 
EZK.16.33	Men give gifts to all harlots, but you give your gifts to all your lovers to bribe them to come to you from every direction for your harlotries. 
EZK.16.34	Thus you are different from those women in your harlotries, in that no one plays the harlot as you do, because you give money and no money is given you; thus you are different.”
EZK.16.35	Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the L
EZK.16.36	Thus says the Lord G
EZK.16.37	therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, even all those whom you loved 
EZK.16.38	Thus I will judge you like women who commit adultery or shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy. 
EZK.16.39	I will also give you into the hands of your lovers, and they will tear down your shrines, demolish your high places, strip you of your clothing, take away your jewels, and will leave you naked and bare. 
EZK.16.40	They will incite a crowd against you and they will stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords. 
EZK.16.41	They will burn your houses with fire and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. Then I will stop you from playing the harlot, and you will also no longer pay your lovers. 
EZK.16.42	So I will calm My fury against you and My jealousy will depart from you, and I will be pacified and angry no more. 
EZK.16.43	Because you have not remembered the days of your youth but have enraged Me by all these things, behold, I in turn will bring your conduct down on your own head,” declares the Lord G
EZK.16.44	“Behold, everyone who quotes proverbs will quote 
EZK.16.45	You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and children. You are also the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. 
EZK.16.46	Now your older sister is Samaria, who lives north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lives south of you, is Sodom with her daughters. 
EZK.16.47	Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they. 
EZK.16.48	As I live,” declares the Lord G
EZK.16.49	Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. 
EZK.16.50	Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. Therefore I removed them when I saw 
EZK.16.51	Furthermore, Samaria did not commit half of your sins, for you have multiplied your abominations more than they. Thus you have made your sisters appear righteous by all your abominations which you have committed. 
EZK.16.52	Also bear your disgrace in that you have made judgment favorable for your sisters. Because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. Yes, be also ashamed and bear your disgrace, in that you made your sisters appear righteous.
EZK.16.53	“Nevertheless, I will restore their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and along with them your own captivity, 
EZK.16.54	in order that you may bear your humiliation and feel ashamed for all that you have done when you become a consolation to them. 
EZK.16.55	Your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to their former state, and you with your daughters will 
EZK.16.56	As 
EZK.16.57	before your wickedness was uncovered, so now you have become the reproach of the daughters of Edom and of all who are around her, of the daughters of the Philistines—those surrounding 
EZK.16.58	You have borne 
EZK.16.59	For thus says the Lord G
EZK.16.60	“Nevertheless, I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. 
EZK.16.61	Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, 
EZK.16.62	Thus I will establish My covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the L
EZK.16.63	so that you may remember and be ashamed and never open your mouth anymore because of your humiliation, when I have forgiven you for all that you have done,” the Lord G
EZK.17.1	Now the word of the L
EZK.17.2	“Son of man, propound a riddle and speak a parable to the house of Israel, 
EZK.17.3	saying, ‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.17.4	He plucked off the topmost of its young twigs and brought it to a land of merchants; he set it in a city of traders. 
EZK.17.5	He also took some of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil. He placed 
EZK.17.6	Then it sprouted and became a low, spreading vine with its branches turned toward him, but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine and yielded shoots and sent out branches.
EZK.17.7	“But there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage; and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and sent out its branches toward him from the beds where it was planted, that he might water it. 
EZK.17.8	It was planted in good soil beside abundant waters, that it might yield branches and bear fruit 
EZK.17.9	Say, ‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.17.10	Behold, though it is planted, will it thrive? Will it not completely wither as soon as the east wind strikes it—wither on the beds where it grew?” ’ ”
EZK.17.11	Moreover, the word of the L
EZK.17.12	“Say now to the rebellious house, ‘Do you not know what these things 
EZK.17.13	He took one of the royal family and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. He also took away the mighty of the land, 
EZK.17.14	that the kingdom might be in subjection, not exalting itself, 
EZK.17.15	But he rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt that they might give him horses and many troops. Will he succeed? Will he who does such things escape? Can he indeed break the covenant and escape? 
EZK.17.16	As I live,’ declares the Lord G
EZK.17.17	Pharaoh with 
EZK.17.18	Now he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and behold, he pledged his allegiance, yet did all these things; he shall not escape.’ ” 
EZK.17.19	Therefore, thus says the Lord G
EZK.17.20	I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. Then I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there 
EZK.17.21	All the choice men in all his troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to every wind; and you will know that I, the L
EZK.17.22	Thus says the Lord G
EZK.17.23	On the high mountain of Israel I will plant it, that it may bring forth boughs and bear fruit and become a stately cedar. And birds of every kind will nest under it; they will nest in the shade of its branches. 
EZK.17.24	All the trees of the field will know that I am the L
EZK.18.1	Then the word of the L
EZK.18.2	“What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying,
EZK.18.2	‘The fathers eat the sour grapes,
EZK.18.2	But the children’s teeth are set on edge’?
EZK.18.3	As I live,” declares the Lord G
EZK.18.4	Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die.
EZK.18.5	“But if a man is righteous and practices justice and righteousness, 
EZK.18.6	and does not eat at the mountain 
EZK.18.7	if a man does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, does not commit robbery, 
EZK.18.8	if he does not lend 
EZK.18.9	 he walks in My statutes and My ordinances so as to deal faithfully—he is righteous 
EZK.18.10	“Then he may have a violent son who sheds blood and who does any of these things to a brother 
EZK.18.11	(though he himself did not do any of these things), that is, he even eats at the mountain 
EZK.18.12	oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore a pledge, but lifts up his eyes to the idols 
EZK.18.13	he lends 
EZK.18.14	“Now behold, he has a son who has observed all his father’s sins which he committed, and observing does not do likewise. 
EZK.18.15	He does not eat at the mountain 
EZK.18.16	or oppress anyone, or retain a pledge, or commit robbery, 
EZK.18.17	he keeps his hand from the poor, does not take interest or increase, 
EZK.18.18	As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed 
EZK.18.19	“Yet you say, ‘Why should the son not bear the punishment for the father’s iniquity?’ When the son has practiced justice and righteousness and has observed all My statutes and done them, he shall surely live. 
EZK.18.20	The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father’s iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son’s iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself.
EZK.18.21	“But if the wicked man turns from all his sins which he has committed and observes all My statutes and practices justice and righteousness, he shall surely live; he shall not die. 
EZK.18.22	All his transgressions which he has committed will not be remembered against him; because of his righteousness which he has practiced, he will live. 
EZK.18.23	Do I have any pleasure in the death of the wicked,” declares the Lord G
EZK.18.24	“But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity and does according to all the abominations that a wicked man does, will he live? All his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered for his treachery which he has committed and his sin which he has committed; for them he will die. 
EZK.18.25	Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not right.’ Hear now, O house of Israel! Is My way not right? Is it not your ways that are not right? 
EZK.18.26	When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity and dies because of it, for his iniquity which he has committed he will die. 
EZK.18.27	Again, when a wicked man turns away from his wickedness which he has committed and practices justice and righteousness, he will save his life. 
EZK.18.28	Because he considered and turned away from all his transgressions which he had committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die. 
EZK.18.29	But the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not right.’ Are My ways not right, O house of Israel? Is it not your ways that are not right?
EZK.18.30	“Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each according to his conduct,” declares the Lord G
EZK.18.31	Cast away from you all your transgressions which you have committed and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! For why will you die, O house of Israel? 
EZK.18.32	For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies,” declares the Lord G
EZK.19.1	“As for you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel 
EZK.19.2	and say,
EZK.19.2	‘What was your mother?
EZK.19.2	A lioness among lions!
EZK.19.2	She lay down among young lions,
EZK.19.2	She reared her cubs.
EZK.19.3	When she brought up one of her cubs,
EZK.19.3	He became a lion,
EZK.19.3	And he learned to tear 
EZK.19.3	He devoured men.
EZK.19.4	Then nations heard about him;
EZK.19.4	He was captured in their pit,
EZK.19.4	And they brought him with hooks
EZK.19.4	To the land of Egypt.
EZK.19.5	When she saw, as she waited,
EZK.19.5	She took another of her cubs
EZK.19.5	And made him a young lion.
EZK.19.6	And he walked about among the lions;
EZK.19.6	He became a young lion,
EZK.19.6	He learned to tear 
EZK.19.6	He devoured men.
EZK.19.7	He destroyed their fortified towers
EZK.19.7	And laid waste their cities;
EZK.19.7	And the land and its fullness were appalled
EZK.19.7	Because of the sound of his roaring.
EZK.19.8	Then nations set against him
EZK.19.8	On every side from 
EZK.19.8	And they spread their net over him;
EZK.19.8	He was captured in their pit.
EZK.19.9	They put him in a cage with hooks
EZK.19.9	And brought him to the king of Babylon;
EZK.19.9	They brought him in hunting nets
EZK.19.9	So that his voice would be heard no more
EZK.19.9	On the mountains of Israel.
EZK.19.10	Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard,
EZK.19.10	Planted by the waters;
EZK.19.10	It was fruitful and full of branches
EZK.19.10	Because of abundant waters.
EZK.19.11	And it had strong branches 
EZK.19.11	And its height was raised above the clouds
EZK.19.11	So that it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches.
EZK.19.12	But it was plucked up in fury;
EZK.19.12	It was cast down to the ground;
EZK.19.12	And the east wind dried up its fruit.
EZK.19.12	Its strong branch was torn off
EZK.19.12	So that it withered;
EZK.19.12	The fire consumed it.
EZK.19.13	And now it is planted in the wilderness,
EZK.19.13	In a dry and thirsty land.
EZK.19.14	And fire has gone out from 
EZK.19.14	It has consumed its shoots 
EZK.19.14	So that there is not in it a strong branch,
EZK.19.14	A scepter to rule.’ ”
EZK.19.14	This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation.
EZK.20.1	Now in the seventh year, in the fifth 
EZK.20.2	And the word of the L
EZK.20.3	“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord G

EZK.20.8	But they rebelled against Me and were not willing to listen to Me; they did not cast away the detestable things of their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt.
EZK.20.9	But I acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they 
EZK.20.10	So I took them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. 
EZK.20.11	I gave them My statutes and informed them of My ordinances, by which, if a man observes them, he will live. 
EZK.20.12	Also I gave them My sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the L
EZK.20.13	But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness. They did not walk in My statutes and they rejected My ordinances, by which, if a man observes them, he will live; and My sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I resolved to pour out My wrath on them in the wilderness, to annihilate them. 
EZK.20.14	But I acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, before whose sight I had brought them out. 
EZK.20.15	Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands, 
EZK.20.16	because they rejected My ordinances, and as for My statutes, they did not walk in them; they even profaned My sabbaths, for their heart continually went after their idols. 
EZK.20.17	Yet My eye spared them rather than destroying them, and I did not cause their annihilation in the wilderness.
EZK.20.18	“I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers or keep their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols. 
EZK.20.19	I am the L
EZK.20.20	Sanctify My sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am the L
EZK.20.21	But the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, nor were they careful to observe My ordinances, by which, 
EZK.20.22	But I withdrew My hand and acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. 
EZK.20.23	Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands, 
EZK.20.24	because they had not observed My ordinances, but had rejected My statutes and had profaned My sabbaths, and their eyes were on the idols of their fathers. 
EZK.20.25	I also gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not live; 
EZK.20.26	and I pronounced them unclean because of their gifts, in that they caused all their firstborn to pass through 
EZK.20.27	“Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord G

EZK.23.3	and they played the harlot in Egypt. They played the harlot in their youth; there their breasts were pressed and there their virgin bosom was handled. 
EZK.23.4	Their names were Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister. And they became Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And 
EZK.23.5	“Oholah played the harlot while she was Mine; and she lusted after her lovers, after the Assyrians, 
EZK.23.6	who were clothed in purple, governors and officials, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses. 
EZK.23.7	She bestowed her harlotries on them, all of whom 
EZK.23.8	She did not forsake her harlotries from 
EZK.23.9	Therefore, I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, after whom she lusted. 
EZK.23.10	They uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, but they slew her with the sword. Thus she became a byword among women, and they executed judgments on her.
EZK.23.11	“Now her sister Oholibah saw 
EZK.23.12	She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and officials, the ones near, magnificently dressed, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men. 
EZK.23.13	I saw that she had defiled herself; they both took the same way. 
EZK.23.14	So she increased her harlotries. And she saw men portrayed on the wall, images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion, 
EZK.23.15	girded with belts on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, like the Babylonians 
EZK.23.16	When she saw them she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. 
EZK.23.17	The Babylonians came to her to the bed of love and defiled her with their harlotry. And when she had been defiled by them, she became disgusted with them. 
EZK.23.18	She uncovered her harlotries and uncovered her nakedness; then I became disgusted with her, as I had become disgusted with her sister.

EZK.23.20	She lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is

EZK.23.24	They will come against you with weapons, chariots and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They will set themselves against you on every side with buckler and shield and helmet; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you according to their customs. 
EZK.23.25	I will set My jealousy against you, that they may deal with you in wrath. They will remove your nose and your ears; and your survivors will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and your survivors will be consumed by the fire.

EZK.23.27	Thus I will make your lewdness and your harlotry 
EZK.23.28	For thus says the Lord G
EZK.23.29	They will deal with you in hatred, take all your property, and leave you naked and bare. And the nakedness of your harlotries will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your harlotries. 
EZK.23.30	These things will be done to you because you have played the harlot with the nations, because you have defiled yourself with their idols.

EZK.23.32	Which is deep and wide.
EZK.23.32	You will be laughed at and held in derision;

EZK.23.33	The cup of horror and desolation,
EZK.23.33	The cup of your sister Samaria.

EZK.23.38	Again, they have done this to Me: they have defiled My sanctuary on the same day and have profaned My sabbaths. 
EZK.23.39	For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols, they entered My sanctuary on the same day to profane it; and lo, thus they did within My house.
EZK.23.40	“Furthermore, they have even sent for men who come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and lo, they came—for whom you bathed, painted your eyes and decorated yourselves with ornaments; 
EZK.23.41	and you sat on a splendid couch with a table arranged before it on which you had set My incense and My oil. 
EZK.23.42	The sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and drunkards were brought from the wilderness with men of the common sort. And they put bracelets on the hands of the women and beautiful crowns on their heads.
EZK.23.43	“Then I said concerning her who was worn out by adulteries, ‘Will they now commit adultery with her when she is 
EZK.23.44	But they went in to her as they would go in to a harlot. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women. 
EZK.23.45	But they, righteous men, will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands.
EZK.23.46	“For thus says the Lord G
EZK.23.47	The company will stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords; they will slay their sons and their daughters and burn their houses with fire. 
EZK.23.48	Thus I will make lewdness cease from the land, that all women may be admonished and not commit lewdness as you have done.

EZK.34.4	Those who are sickly you have not strengthened, the diseased you have not healed, the broken you have not bound up, the scattered you have not brought back, nor have you sought for the lost; but with force and with severity you have dominated them. 
EZK.34.5	They were scattered for lack of a shepherd, and they became food for every beast of the field and were scattered. 
EZK.34.6	My flock wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill; My flock was scattered over all the surface of the earth, and there was no one to search or seek

EZK.34.13	I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and bring them to their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the streams, and in all the inhabited places of the land. 
EZK.34.14	I will feed them in a good pasture, and their grazing ground will be on the mountain heights of Israel. There they will lie down on good grazing ground and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. 
EZK.34.15	I will feed My flock and I will lead them to rest,” declares the Lord G
EZK.34.16	“I will seek the lost, bring back the scattered, bind up the broken and strengthen the sick; but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with judgment.

EZK.41.18	It was carved with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces, 
EZK.41.19	a man’s face toward the palm tree on one side and a young lion’s face toward the palm tree on the other side; they were carved on all the house all around. 
EZK.41.20	From the ground to above the entrance cherubim and palm trees were carved, as well as 
EZK.41.21	The doorposts of the nave were square; as for the front of the sanctuary, the appearance of one doorpost was like that of the other. 
EZK.41.22	The altar 
EZK.41.23	The nave and the sanctuary each had a double door. 
EZK.41.24	Each of the doors had two leaves, two swinging leaves; two 
EZK.41.25	Also there were carved on them, on the doors of the nave, cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls; and 
EZK.41.26	 latticed windows and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch; thus 
EZK.42.1	Then he brought me out into the outer court, the way toward the north; and he brought me to the chamber which 
EZK.42.2	Along the length, 
EZK.42.3	Opposite the twenty 
EZK.42.4	Before the chambers 
EZK.42.5	Now the upper chambers 
EZK.42.6	For they 
EZK.42.7	As for the outer wall by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court facing the chambers, its length 
EZK.42.8	For the length of the chambers which 
EZK.42.9	Below these chambers 
EZK.42.10	In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, facing the separate area and facing the building, 
EZK.42.11	The way in front of them 
EZK.42.12	Corresponding to the openings of the chambers which were toward the south was an opening at the head of the way, the way in front of the wall toward the east, as one enters them.
EZK.42.13	Then he said to me, “The north chambers 
EZK.42.14	When the priests enter, then they shall not go out into the outer court from the sanctuary without laying there their garments in which they minister, for they are holy. They shall put on other garments; then they shall approach that which is for the people.”
EZK.42.15	Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate which faced toward the east and measured it all around. 
EZK.42.16	He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds by the measuring reed. 
EZK.42.17	He measured on the north side five hundred reeds by the measuring reed. 
EZK.42.18	On the south side he measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. 
EZK.42.19	He turned to the west side 
EZK.42.20	He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, the length five hundred and the width five hundred, to divide between the holy and the profane.
EZK.43.1	Then he led me to the gate, the gate facing toward the east; 
EZK.43.2	and behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the way of the east. And His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory. 
EZK.43.3	And 
EZK.43.4	And the glory of the L
EZK.43.5	And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the L
EZK.43.6	Then I heard one speaking to me from the house, while a man was standing beside me. 
EZK.43.7	He said to me, “Son of man, 
EZK.43.8	by setting their threshold by My threshold and their door post beside My door post, with 
EZK.43.9	Now let them put away their harlotry and the

EZK.43.11	If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the house, its structure, its exits, its entrances, all its designs, all its statutes, and all its laws. And write 
EZK.43.12	This is the law of the house: its entire area on the top of the mountain all around 
EZK.43.13	“And these are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth): the base 
EZK.43.14	From the base on the ground to the lower ledge 
EZK.43.15	The altar hearth 
EZK.43.16	Now the altar hearth 
EZK.43.17	The ledge 
EZK.43.18	And He said to me, “Son of man, thus says the Lord G
EZK.43.19	You shall give to the Levitical priests who are from the offspring of Zadok, who draw near to Me to minister to Me,’ declares the Lord G
EZK.43.20	You shall take some of its blood and put it on its four horns and on the four corners of the ledge and on the border round about; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it. 
EZK.43.21	You shall also take the bull for the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.
EZK.43.22	‘On the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering, and they shall cleanse the altar as they cleansed 
EZK.43.23	When you have finished cleansing

EZK.43.26	For seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it. 
EZK.43.27	When they have completed the days, it shall be that on the eighth day and onward, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you,’ declares the Lord G
EZK.44.1	Then He brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces the east; and it was shut.

EZK.44.12	Because they ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have sworn against them,” declares the Lord G
EZK.44.13	And they shall not come near to Me to serve as a priest to Me, nor come near to any of My holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they will bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed. 
EZK.44.14	Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the house, of all its service and of all that shall be done in it.
EZK.44.15	“But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept charge of My sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from Me, shall come near to Me to minister to Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer Me the fat and the blood,” declares the Lord G

DAN.1.1	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. 
DAN.1.2	The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his 
DAN.1.3	Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his 
DAN.1.4	youths in whom was no defect, who were good-looking, showing intelligence in every 
DAN.1.5	The king appointed for them a daily ration from the king’s choice food and from the wine which he drank, and 
DAN.1.6	Now among them from the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. 
DAN.1.7	Then the commander of the officials assigned 
DAN.1.8	But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the king’s choice food or with the wine which he drank; so he sought 
DAN.1.9	Now God granted Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the commander of the officials, 
DAN.1.10	and the commander of the officials said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces looking more haggard than the youths who are your own age? Then you would make me forfeit my head to the king.” 
DAN.1.11	But Daniel said to the overseer whom the commander of the officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, 
DAN.1.12	“Please test your servants for ten days, and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	Then let our appearance be observed in your presence and the appearance of the youths who are eating the king’s choice food; and deal with your servants according to what you see.”
DAN.1.14	So he listened to them in this matter and tested them for ten days. 
DAN.1.15	At the end of ten days their appearance seemed better and they were fatter than all the youths who had been eating the king’s choice food. 
DAN.1.16	So the overseer continued to withhold their choice food and the wine they were to drink, and kept giving them vegetables.
DAN.1.17	As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in every 
DAN.1.18	Then at the end of the days which the king had specified for presenting them, the commander of the officials presented them before Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.1.19	The king talked with them, and out of them all not one was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king’s personal service. 
DAN.1.20	As for every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king consulted them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians 
DAN.1.21	And Daniel continued until the first year of Cyrus the king.
DAN.2.1	Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him. 
DAN.2.2	Then the king gave orders to call in the 
DAN.2.3	The king said to them, “I had a dream and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream.”
DAN.2.4	Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic: “O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants, and we will declare the interpretation.” 
DAN.2.5	The king replied to the Chaldeans, “The command from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses will be made a rubbish heap. 
DAN.2.6	But if you declare the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts and a reward and great honor; therefore declare to me the dream and its interpretation.” 
DAN.2.7	They answered a second time and said, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will declare the interpretation.” 
DAN.2.8	The king replied, “I know for certain that you are bargaining for time, inasmuch as you have seen that the command from me is firm, 
DAN.2.9	that if you do not make the dream known to me, there is only one decree for you. For you have agreed together to speak lying and corrupt words before me until the situation is changed; therefore tell me the dream, that I may know that you can declare to me its interpretation.” 
DAN.2.10	The Chaldeans answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth who could declare the matter for the king, inasmuch as no great king or ruler has 
DAN.2.11	Moreover, the thing which the king demands is difficult, and there is no one else who could declare it to the king except gods, whose dwelling place is not with 
DAN.2.12	Because of this the king became indignant and very furious and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.13	So the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they looked for Daniel and his friends to kill 
DAN.2.14	Then Daniel replied with discretion and discernment to Arioch, the captain of the king’s bodyguard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon; 
DAN.2.15	he said to Arioch, the king’s commander, “For what reason is the decree from the king 
DAN.2.16	So Daniel went in and requested of the king that he would give him time, in order that he might declare the interpretation to the king.
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went to his house and informed his friends, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, about the matter, 
DAN.2.18	so that they might request compassion from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his friends would not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
DAN.2.19	Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven; 
DAN.2.20	Daniel said,
DAN.2.20	“Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever,
DAN.2.20	For wisdom and power belong to Him.
DAN.2.21	It is He who changes the times and the epochs;
DAN.2.21	He removes kings and establishes kings;
DAN.2.21	He gives wisdom to wise men
DAN.2.21	And knowledge to men of understanding.
DAN.2.22	It is He who reveals the profound and hidden things;
DAN.2.22	He knows what is in the darkness,
DAN.2.22	And the light dwells with Him.
DAN.2.23	To You, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise,
DAN.2.23	For You have given me wisdom and power;
DAN.2.23	Even now You have made known to me what we requested of You,
DAN.2.23	For You have made known to us the king’s matter.”
DAN.2.24	Therefore, Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and spoke to him as follows: “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon! Take me into the king’s presence, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.”
DAN.2.25	Then Arioch hurriedly brought Daniel into the king’s presence and spoke to him as follows: “I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can make the interpretation known to the king!” 
DAN.2.26	The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen and its interpretation?” 
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered before the king and said, “As for the mystery about which the king has inquired, neither wise men, conjurers, magicians 
DAN.2.28	However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will take place in the latter days. This was your dream and the visions in your mind 
DAN.2.29	As for you, O king, 
DAN.2.30	But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me for any wisdom residing in me more than 
DAN.2.31	“You, O king, were looking and behold, there was a single great statue; that statue, which was large and of extraordinary splendor, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was awesome. 
DAN.2.32	The head of that statue 
DAN.2.33	its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. 
DAN.2.34	You continued looking until a stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and crushed them. 
DAN.2.35	Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were crushed all at the same time and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them was found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
DAN.2.36	“This 
DAN.2.37	You, O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength and the glory; 
DAN.2.38	and wherever the sons of men dwell, 
DAN.2.39	After you there will arise another kingdom inferior to you, then another third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over all the earth.
DAN.2.40	Then there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron; inasmuch as iron crushes and shatters all things, so, like iron that breaks in pieces, it will crush and break all these in pieces. 
DAN.2.41	In that you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but it will have in it the toughness of iron, inasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with common clay. 
DAN.2.42	 the toes of the feet 
DAN.2.43	And in that you saw the iron mixed with common clay, they will combine with one another in the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, even as iron does not combine with pottery.
DAN.2.44	In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, and 
DAN.2.45	Inasmuch as you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what will take place in the future; so the dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy.”
DAN.2.46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and did homage to Daniel, and gave orders to present to him an offering and fragrant incense. 
DAN.2.47	The king answered Daniel and said, “Surely your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, since you have been able to reveal this mystery.” 
DAN.2.48	Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.49	And Daniel made request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon, while Daniel 
DAN.3.1	Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, the height of which 
DAN.3.2	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent 
DAN.3.3	Then the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces were assembled for the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 
DAN.3.4	Then the herald loudly proclaimed: “To you the command is given, O peoples, nations and 
DAN.3.5	that at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up. 
DAN.3.6	But whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.” 
DAN.3.7	Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and 
DAN.3.8	For this reason at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought charges against the Jews. 
DAN.3.9	They responded and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king: “O king, live forever! 
DAN.3.10	You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe and all kinds of music, is to fall down and worship the golden image. 
DAN.3.11	But whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire. 
DAN.3.12	There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon, 
DAN.3.13	Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and anger gave orders to bring Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego; then these men were brought before the king. 
DAN.3.14	Nebuchadnezzar responded and said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up? 
DAN.3.15	Now if you are ready, at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery and bagpipe and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, 
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego replied to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to give you an answer concerning this matter. 
DAN.3.17	If it be 
DAN.3.18	But 
DAN.3.19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and his facial expression was altered toward Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. He answered by giving orders to heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated. 
DAN.3.20	He commanded certain valiant warriors who 
DAN.3.21	Then these men were tied up in their trousers, their coats, their caps and their 
DAN.3.22	For this reason, because the king’s command 
DAN.3.23	But these three men, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, fell into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire 
DAN.3.24	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astounded and stood up in haste; he said to his high officials, “Was it not three men we cast bound into the midst of the fire?” They replied to the king, “Certainly, O king.” 
DAN.3.25	He said, “Look! I see four men loosed 
DAN.3.26	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the furnace of blazing fire; he responded and said, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, come out, you servants of the Most High God, and come here!” Then Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego came out of the midst of the fire. 
DAN.3.27	The satraps, the prefects, the governors and the king’s high officials gathered around 
DAN.3.28	Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who put their trust in Him, violating the king’s command, and yielded up their bodies so as not to serve or worship any god except their own God. 
DAN.3.29	Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation or tongue that speaks anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego shall be torn limb from limb and their houses reduced to a rubbish heap, inasmuch as there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.” 
DAN.3.30	Then the king caused Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego to prosper in the province of Babylon.
DAN.4.1	Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples, nations, and 
DAN.4.2	It has seemed good to me to declare the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me.
DAN.4.3	How great are His signs
DAN.4.3	And how mighty are His wonders!
DAN.4.3	His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom
DAN.4.3	And His dominion is from generation to generation.
DAN.4.4	“I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace. 
DAN.4.5	I saw a dream and it made me fearful; and 
DAN.4.6	So I gave orders to bring into my presence all the wise men of Babylon, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. 
DAN.4.7	Then the magicians, the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the diviners came in and I related the dream to them, but they could not make its interpretation known to me. 
DAN.4.8	But finally Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar according to the name of my god, and in whom is 
DAN.4.9	‘O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, since I know that a spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery baffles you, tell 
DAN.4.10	‘Now 
DAN.4.11	The tree grew large and became strong
DAN.4.11	And its height reached to the sky,
DAN.4.11	And it 
DAN.4.12	Its foliage 
DAN.4.12	And in it 
DAN.4.12	The beasts of the field found shade under it,
DAN.4.12	And the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches,
DAN.4.12	And all living creatures fed themselves from it.
DAN.4.13	‘I was looking in the visions in my mind 
DAN.4.14	He shouted out and spoke as follows:
DAN.4.14	“Chop down the tree and cut off its branches,
DAN.4.14	Strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit;
DAN.4.14	Let the beasts flee from under it
DAN.4.14	And the birds from its branches.
DAN.4.15	Yet leave the stump with its roots in the ground,
DAN.4.15	But with a band of iron and bronze 
DAN.4.15	In the new grass of the field;
DAN.4.15	And let him be drenched with the dew of heaven,
DAN.4.15	And let him share with the beasts in the grass of the earth.
DAN.4.16	Let his mind be changed from 
DAN.4.16	And let a beast’s mind be given to him,
DAN.4.16	And let seven periods of time pass over him.
DAN.4.17	This sentence is by the decree of the 
DAN.4.17	And the decision is a command of the holy ones,
DAN.4.17	In order that the living may know
DAN.4.17	That the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind,
DAN.4.17	And bestows it on whom He wishes
DAN.4.17	And sets over it the lowliest of men.”
DAN.4.18	This is the dream 
DAN.4.19	“Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was appalled for a while as his thoughts alarmed him. The king responded and said, ‘Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.’ Belteshazzar replied, ‘My lord, 
DAN.4.20	The tree that you saw, which became large and grew strong, whose height reached to the sky and was visible to all the earth 
DAN.4.21	and whose foliage 
DAN.4.22	it is you, O king; for you have become great and grown strong, and your majesty has become great and reached to the sky and your dominion to the end of the earth. 
DAN.4.23	In that the king saw an 
DAN.4.24	this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king: 
DAN.4.25	that you be driven away from mankind and your dwelling place be with the beasts of the field, and you be given grass to eat like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven; and seven periods of time will pass over you, until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever He wishes. 
DAN.4.26	And in that it was commanded to leave the stump with the roots of the tree, your kingdom will be assured to you after you recognize that 
DAN.4.27	Therefore, O king, may my advice be pleasing to you: break away now from your sins by 
DAN.4.28	“All 
DAN.4.29	Twelve months later he was walking on the 
DAN.4.30	The king reflected and said, ‘Is this not Babylon the great, which I myself have built as a royal residence by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?’ 
DAN.4.31	While the word 
DAN.4.32	and you will be driven away from mankind, and your dwelling place 
DAN.4.33	Immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled; and he was driven away from mankind and began eating grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair had grown like eagles’ 
DAN.4.34	“But at the end of that period, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High and praised and honored Him who lives forever;
DAN.4.34	For His dominion is an everlasting dominion,
DAN.4.34	And His kingdom 
DAN.4.35	All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing,
DAN.4.35	But He does according to His will in the host of heaven
DAN.4.35	And 
DAN.4.35	And no one can ward off His hand
DAN.4.35	Or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’
DAN.4.36	At that time my reason returned to me. And my majesty and splendor were restored to me for the glory of my kingdom, and my counselors and my nobles began seeking me out; so I was reestablished in my sovereignty, and surpassing greatness was added to me. 
DAN.4.37	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt and honor the King of heaven, for all His works are true and His ways just, and He is able to humble those who walk in pride.”
DAN.5.1	Belshazzar the king held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles, and he was drinking wine in the presence of the thousand. 
DAN.5.2	When Belshazzar tasted the wine, he gave orders to bring the gold and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which 
DAN.5.3	Then they brought the gold vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God which 
DAN.5.4	They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone.
DAN.5.5	Suddenly the fingers of a man’s hand emerged and began writing opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace, and the king saw the back of the hand that did the writing. 
DAN.5.6	Then the king’s face grew pale and his thoughts alarmed him, and his hip joints went slack and his knees began knocking together. 
DAN.5.7	The king called aloud to bring in the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the diviners. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, “Any man who can read this inscription and explain its interpretation to me shall be clothed with purple and 
DAN.5.8	Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the inscription or make known its interpretation to the king. 
DAN.5.9	Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed, his face grew 
DAN.5.10	The queen entered the banquet hall because of the words of the king and his nobles; the queen spoke and said, “O king, live forever! Do not let your thoughts alarm you or your face be pale. 
DAN.5.11	There is a man in your kingdom in whom is a spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father, illumination, insight and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him. And King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, your father the king, appointed him chief of the magicians, conjurers, Chaldeans 
DAN.5.12	 because an extraordinary spirit, knowledge and insight, interpretation of dreams, explanation of enigmas and solving of difficult problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Let Daniel now be summoned and he will declare the interpretation.”
DAN.5.13	Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel who is one of the exiles from Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah? 
DAN.5.14	Now I have heard about you that a spirit of the gods is in you, and that illumination, insight and extraordinary wisdom have been found in you. 
DAN.5.15	Just now the wise men 
DAN.5.16	But I personally have heard about you, that you are able to give interpretations and solve difficult problems. Now if you are able to read the inscription and make its interpretation known to me, you will be clothed with purple and 
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered and said before the king, “Keep your gifts for yourself or give your rewards to someone else; however, I will read the inscription to the king and make the interpretation known to him. 
DAN.5.18	O king, the Most High God granted sovereignty, grandeur, glory and majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your father. 
DAN.5.19	Because of the grandeur which He bestowed on him, all the peoples, nations and 
DAN.5.20	But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became so proud that he behaved arrogantly, he was deposed from his royal throne and 
DAN.5.21	He was also driven away from mankind, and his heart was made like 
DAN.5.22	Yet you, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this, 
DAN.5.23	but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines have been drinking wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which do not see, hear or understand. But the God in whose hand are your life-breath and all your ways, you have not glorified. 
DAN.5.24	Then the hand was sent from Him and this inscription was written out.
DAN.5.25	“Now this is the inscription that was written out: ‘MENĒ, MENĒ, TEKĒL, UPHARSIN.’ 
DAN.5.26	This is the interpretation of the message: ‘MENĒ’—God has numbered your kingdom and put an end to it. 
DAN.5.27	‘TEKĒL’—you have been weighed on the scales and found deficient. 
DAN.5.28	‘PERĒS’—your kingdom has been divided and given over to the Medes and Persians.”
DAN.5.29	Then Belshazzar gave orders, and they clothed Daniel with purple and 
DAN.5.30	That same night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain. 
DAN.5.31	So Darius the Mede received the kingdom at about the age of sixty-two.
DAN.6.1	It seemed good to Darius to appoint 120 satraps over the kingdom, that they would be in charge of the whole kingdom, 
DAN.6.2	and over them three commissioners (of whom Daniel was one), that these satraps might be accountable to them, and that the king might not suffer loss. 
DAN.6.3	Then this Daniel began distinguishing himself among the commissioners and satraps because he possessed an extraordinary spirit, and the king planned to appoint him over the entire kingdom. 
DAN.6.4	Then the commissioners and satraps began trying to find a ground of accusation against Daniel in regard to government affairs; but they could find no ground of accusation or 
DAN.6.5	Then these men said, “We will not find any ground of accusation against this Daniel unless we find 
DAN.6.6	Then these commissioners and satraps came by agreement to the king and spoke to him as follows: “King Darius, live forever! 
DAN.6.7	All the commissioners of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the high officials and the governors have consulted together that the king should establish a statute and enforce an injunction that anyone who makes a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, shall be cast into the lions’ den. 
DAN.6.8	Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document so that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked.” 
DAN.6.9	Therefore King Darius signed the document, that is, the injunction.
DAN.6.10	Now when Daniel knew that the document was signed, he entered his house (now in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem); and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God, as he had been doing previously. 
DAN.6.11	Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God. 
DAN.6.12	Then they approached and spoke before the king about the king’s injunction, “Did you not sign an injunction that any man who makes a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, is to be cast into the lions’ den?” The king replied, “The statement is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked.” 
DAN.6.13	Then they answered and spoke before the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the injunction which you signed, but keeps making his petition three times a day.”
DAN.6.14	Then, as soon as the king heard this statement, he was deeply distressed and set 
DAN.6.15	Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, “Recognize, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or statute which the king establishes may be changed.”
DAN.6.16	Then the king gave orders, and Daniel was brought in and cast into the lions’ den. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Your God whom you constantly serve will Himself deliver you.” 
DAN.6.17	A stone was brought and laid over the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles, so that nothing would be changed in regard to Daniel. 
DAN.6.18	Then the king went off to his palace and spent the night fasting, and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.
DAN.6.19	Then the king arose at dawn, at the break of day, and went in haste to the lions’ den. 
DAN.6.20	When he had come near the den to Daniel, he cried out with a troubled voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you constantly serve, been able to deliver you from the lions?” 
DAN.6.21	Then Daniel spoke to the king, “O king, live forever! 
DAN.6.22	My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths and they have not harmed me, inasmuch as I was found innocent before Him; and also toward you, O king, I have committed no crime.” 
DAN.6.23	Then the king was very pleased and gave orders for Daniel to be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no injury whatever was found on him, because he had trusted in his God. 
DAN.6.24	The king then gave orders, and they brought those men who had maliciously accused Daniel, and they cast them, their children and their wives into the lions’ den; and they had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.
DAN.6.25	Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations and 
DAN.6.26	I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men are to fear and tremble before the God of Daniel;
DAN.6.26	For He is the living God and enduring forever,
DAN.6.26	And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed,
DAN.6.26	And His dominion 
DAN.6.27	He delivers and rescues and performs signs and wonders
DAN.6.27	In heaven and on earth,
DAN.6.27	Who has 
DAN.6.28	So this Daniel enjoyed success in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
DAN.7.1	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions in his mind 
DAN.7.2	Daniel said, “I was looking in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. 
DAN.7.3	And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, different from one another. 
DAN.7.4	The first 
DAN.7.5	And behold, another beast, a second one, resembling a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs 
DAN.7.6	After this I kept looking, and behold, another one, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it. 
DAN.7.7	After this I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrifying and extremely strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. 
DAN.7.8	While I was contemplating the horns, behold, another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth uttering great 
DAN.7.9	“I kept looking
DAN.7.9	Until thrones were set up,
DAN.7.9	And the Ancient of Days took 
DAN.7.9	His vesture 
DAN.7.9	And the hair of His head like pure wool.
DAN.7.9	His throne 
DAN.7.9	Its wheels 
DAN.7.10	A river of fire was flowing
DAN.7.10	And coming out from before Him;
DAN.7.10	Thousands upon thousands were attending Him,
DAN.7.10	And myriads upon myriads were standing before Him;
DAN.7.10	The court sat,
DAN.7.10	And the books were opened.
DAN.7.11	Then I kept looking because of the sound of the boastful words which the horn was speaking; I kept looking until the beast was slain, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire. 
DAN.7.12	As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was granted to them for an appointed period of time.
DAN.7.13	“I kept looking in the night visions,
DAN.7.13	And behold, with the clouds of heaven
DAN.7.13	One like a Son of Man was coming,
DAN.7.13	And He came up to the Ancient of Days
DAN.7.13	And was presented before Him.
DAN.7.14	And to Him was given dominion,
DAN.7.14	Glory and a kingdom,
DAN.7.14	That all the peoples, nations and 
DAN.7.14	Might serve Him.
DAN.7.14	His dominion is an everlasting dominion
DAN.7.14	Which will not pass away;
DAN.7.14	And His kingdom is one
DAN.7.14	Which will not be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed within me, and the visions in my mind kept alarming me. 
DAN.7.16	I approached one of those who were standing by and began asking him the exact meaning of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things: 
DAN.7.17	‘These great beasts, which are four 
DAN.7.18	But the saints of the Highest One will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, for all ages to come.’
DAN.7.19	“Then I desired to know the exact meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, with its teeth of iron and its claws of bronze, 
DAN.7.20	and 
DAN.7.21	I kept looking, and that horn was waging war with the saints and overpowering them 
DAN.7.22	until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was passed in favor of the saints of the Highest One, and the time arrived when the saints took possession of the kingdom.
DAN.7.23	“Thus he said: ‘The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, which will be different from all the 
DAN.7.24	As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the previous ones and will subdue three kings. 
DAN.7.25	He will speak out against the Most High and wear down the saints of the Highest One, and he will intend to make alterations in times and in law; and they will be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time. 
DAN.7.26	But the court will sit 
DAN.7.27	Then the sovereignty, the dominion and the greatness of 
DAN.7.28	“At this point the revelation ended. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts were greatly alarming me and my face grew pale, but I kept the matter to myself.”
DAN.8.1	In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king a vision appeared to me, Daniel, subsequent to the one which appeared to me previously. 
DAN.8.2	I looked in the vision, and while I was looking I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam; and I looked in the vision and I myself was beside the Ulai Canal. 
DAN.8.3	Then I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a ram which had two horns was standing in front of the canal. Now the two horns 
DAN.8.4	I saw the ram butting westward, northward, and southward, and no 
DAN.8.5	While I was observing, behold, a male goat was coming from the west over the surface of the whole earth without touching the ground; and the goat 
DAN.8.6	He came up to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing in front of the canal, and rushed at him in his mighty wrath. 
DAN.8.7	I saw him come beside the ram, and he was enraged at him; and he struck the ram and shattered his two horns, and the ram had no strength to withstand him. So he hurled him to the ground and trampled on him, and there was none to rescue the ram from his power. 
DAN.8.8	Then the male goat magnified 
DAN.8.9	Out of one of them came forth a rather small horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the 
DAN.8.10	It grew up to the host of heaven and caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them down. 
DAN.8.11	It even magnified 
DAN.8.12	And on account of transgression the host will be given over 
DAN.8.13	Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to that particular one who was speaking, “How long will the vision 
DAN.8.14	He said to me, “For 2,300 evenings 
DAN.8.15	When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and behold, standing before me was one who looked like a man. 
DAN.8.16	And I heard the voice of a man between 
DAN.8.17	So he came near to where I was standing, and when he came I was frightened and fell on my face; but he said to me, “Son of man, understand that the vision pertains to the time of the end.”
DAN.8.18	Now while he was talking with me, I sank into a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me and made me stand upright. 
DAN.8.19	He said, “Behold, I am going to let you know what will occur at the final period of the indignation, for

DAN.8.23	In the latter period of their rule,
DAN.8.23	When the transgressors have run 
DAN.8.23	A king will arise,
DAN.8.23	Insolent and skilled in intrigue.
DAN.8.24	His power will be mighty, but not by his 
DAN.8.24	And he will destroy to an extraordinary degree
DAN.8.24	And prosper and perform 
DAN.8.24	He will destroy mighty men and the holy people.
DAN.8.25	And through his shrewdness
DAN.8.25	He will cause deceit to succeed by his influence;
DAN.8.25	And he will magnify 
DAN.8.25	And he will destroy many while 
DAN.8.25	He will even oppose the Prince of princes,
DAN.8.25	But he will be broken without human agency.
DAN.8.26	The vision of the evenings and mornings
DAN.8.26	Which has been told is true;
DAN.8.26	But keep the vision secret,
DAN.8.26	For 
DAN.8.27	Then I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick for days. Then I got up 
DAN.9.1	In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of Median descent, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans— 
DAN.9.2	in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, observed in the books the number of the years which was 
DAN.9.3	So I gave my attention to the Lord God to seek 
DAN.9.4	I prayed to the L
DAN.9.5	we have sinned, committed iniquity, acted wickedly and rebelled, even turning aside from Your commandments and ordinances. 
DAN.9.6	Moreover, we have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our princes, our fathers and all the people of the land.
DAN.9.7	“Righteousness belongs to You, O Lord, but to us open shame, as it is this day—to the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, those who are nearby and those who are far away in all the countries to which You have driven them, because of their unfaithful deeds which they have committed against You. 
DAN.9.8	Open shame belongs to us, O Lord, to our kings, our princes and our fathers, because we have sinned against You. 
DAN.9.9	To the Lord our God 
DAN.9.10	nor have we obeyed the voice of the L
DAN.9.11	Indeed all Israel has transgressed Your law and turned aside, not obeying Your voice; so the curse has been poured out on us, along with the oath which is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we have sinned against Him. 
DAN.9.12	Thus He has confirmed His words which He had spoken against us and against our rulers who ruled us, to bring on us great calamity; for under the whole heaven there has not been done 
DAN.9.13	As it is written in the law of Moses, all this calamity has come on us; yet we have not sought the favor of the L
DAN.9.14	Therefore the L
DAN.9.15	“And now, O Lord our God, who have brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and have made a name for Yourself, as it is this day—we have sinned, we have been wicked. 
DAN.9.16	O Lord, in accordance with all Your righteous acts, let now Your anger and Your wrath turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people 
DAN.9.17	So now, our God, listen to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplications, and for Your sake, O Lord, let Your face shine on Your desolate sanctuary. 
DAN.9.18	O my God, incline Your ear and hear! Open Your eyes and see our desolations and the city which is called by Your name; for we are not presenting our supplications before You on account of any merits of our own, but on account of Your great compassion. 
DAN.9.19	O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and take action! For Your own sake, O my God, do not delay, because Your city and Your people are called by Your name.”
DAN.9.20	Now while I was speaking and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the L
DAN.9.21	while I was still speaking in prayer, then the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision previously, came to me in 
DAN.9.22	He gave 
DAN.9.23	At the beginning of your supplications the command was issued, and I have come to tell 
DAN.9.24	“Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sin, to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy 
DAN.9.25	So you are to know and discern 
DAN.9.26	Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be cut off and have nothing, and the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end 
DAN.9.27	And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations 
DAN.10.1	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar; and the message was true and 
DAN.10.2	In those days, I, Daniel, had been mourning for three entire weeks. 
DAN.10.3	I did not eat any tasty food, nor did meat or wine enter my mouth, nor did I use any ointment at all until the entire three weeks were completed. 
DAN.10.4	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, while I was by the bank of the great river, that is, the Tigris, 
DAN.10.5	I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a certain man dressed in linen, whose waist was girded with 
DAN.10.6	His body also 
DAN.10.7	Now I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, while the men who were with me did not see the vision; nevertheless, a great dread fell on them, and they ran away to hide themselves. 
DAN.10.8	So I was left alone and saw this great vision; yet no strength was left in me, for my natural color turned to a deathly pallor, and I retained no strength. 
DAN.10.9	But I heard the sound of his words; and as soon as I heard the sound of his words, I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground.
DAN.10.10	Then behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. 
DAN.10.11	He said to me, “O Daniel, man of high esteem, understand the words that I am about to tell you and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you.” And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling. 
DAN.10.12	Then he said to me, “Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding 
DAN.10.13	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was withstanding me for twenty-one days; then behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia. 
DAN.10.14	Now I have come to give you an understanding of what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision pertains to the days yet 
DAN.10.15	When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and became speechless. 
DAN.10.16	And behold, one who resembled a human being was touching my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who was standing before me, “O my lord, as a result of the vision anguish has come upon me, and I have retained no strength. 
DAN.10.17	For how can such a servant of my lord talk with such as my lord? As for me, there remains just now no strength in me, nor has any breath been left in me.”
DAN.10.18	Then 
DAN.10.19	He said, “O man of high esteem, do not be afraid. Peace be with you; take courage and be courageous!” Now as soon as he spoke to me, I received strength and said, “May my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.” 
DAN.10.20	Then he said, “Do you understand why I came to you? But I shall now return to fight against the prince of Persia; so I am going forth, and behold, the prince of Greece is about to come. 
DAN.10.21	However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth. Yet there is no one who stands firmly with me against these 
DAN.11.1	“In the first year of Darius the Mede, I arose to be an encouragement and a protection for him. 
DAN.11.2	And now I will tell you the truth. Behold, three more kings are going to arise in Persia. Then a fourth will gain far more riches than all 
DAN.11.3	And a mighty king will arise, and he will rule with great authority and do as he pleases. 
DAN.11.4	But as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom will be broken up and parceled out toward the four points of the compass, though not to his 
DAN.11.5	“Then the king of the South will grow strong, along with 
DAN.11.6	After some years they will form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North to carry out a peaceful arrangement. But she will not retain her position of power, nor will he remain with his power, but she will be given up, along with those who brought her in and the one who sired her as well as he who supported her in 
DAN.11.7	But one of the descendants of her line will arise in his place, and he will come against 
DAN.11.8	Also their gods with their metal images 
DAN.11.9	Then the latter will enter the realm of the king of the South, but will return to his 
DAN.11.10	“His sons will mobilize and assemble a multitude of great forces; and one of them will keep on coming and overflow and pass through, that he may again wage war up to his 
DAN.11.11	The king of the South will be enraged and go forth and fight with the king of the North. Then the latter will raise a great multitude, but 
DAN.11.12	When the multitude is carried away, his heart will be lifted up, and he will cause tens of thousands to fall; yet he will not prevail. 
DAN.11.13	For the king of the North will again raise a greater multitude than the former, and after an interval of some years he will press on with a great army and much equipment.
DAN.11.14	“Now in those times many will rise up against the king of the South; the violent ones among your people will also lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they will fall down. 
DAN.11.15	Then the king of the North will come, cast up a siege ramp and capture a well-fortified city; and the forces of the South will not stand 
DAN.11.16	But he who comes against him will do as he pleases, and no one will 
DAN.11.17	He will set his face to come with the power of his whole kingdom, bringing with him a proposal of peace which he will put into effect; he will also give him the daughter of women to ruin it. But she will not take a stand 
DAN.11.18	Then he will turn his face to the coastlands and capture many. But a commander will put a stop to his scorn against him; moreover, he will repay him for his scorn. 
DAN.11.19	So he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall and be found no more.
DAN.11.20	“Then in his place one will arise who will send an oppressor through the 
DAN.11.21	In his place a despicable person will arise, on whom the honor of kingship has not been conferred, but he will come in a time of tranquility and seize the kingdom by intrigue. 
DAN.11.22	The overflowing forces will be flooded away before him and shattered, and also the prince of the covenant. 
DAN.11.23	After an alliance is made with him he will practice deception, and he will go up and gain power with a small 
DAN.11.24	In a time of tranquility he will enter the richest 
DAN.11.25	He will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South with a large army; so the king of the South will mobilize an extremely large and mighty army for war; but he will not stand, for schemes will be devised against him. 
DAN.11.26	Those who eat his choice food will destroy him, and his army will overflow, but many will fall down slain. 
DAN.11.27	As for both kings, their hearts will be 
DAN.11.28	Then he will return to his land with much plunder; but his heart will be 
DAN.11.29	“At the appointed time he will return and come into the South, but this last time it will not turn out the way it did before. 
DAN.11.30	For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be disheartened and will return and become enraged at the holy covenant and take action; so he will come back and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant. 
DAN.11.31	Forces from him will arise, desecrate the sanctuary fortress, and do away with the regular sacrifice. And they will set up the abomination of desolation. 
DAN.11.32	By smooth 
DAN.11.33	Those who have insight among the people will give understanding to the many; yet they will fall by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder for 
DAN.11.34	Now when they fall they will be granted a little help, and many will join with them in hypocrisy. 
DAN.11.35	Some of those who have insight will fall, in order to refine, purge and make them pure until the end time; because 
DAN.11.36	“Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak monstrous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is finished, for that which is decreed will be done. 
DAN.11.37	He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any 
DAN.11.38	But instead he will honor a god of fortresses, a god whom his fathers did not know; he will honor 
DAN.11.39	He will take action against the strongest of fortresses with 
DAN.11.40	“At the end time the king of the South will collide with him, and the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, with horsemen and with many ships; and he will enter countries, overflow 
DAN.11.41	He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many 
DAN.11.42	Then he will stretch out his hand against 
DAN.11.43	But he will gain control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the precious things of Egypt; and Libyans and Ethiopians 
DAN.11.44	But rumors from the East and from the North will disturb him, and he will go forth with great wrath to destroy and annihilate many. 
DAN.11.45	He will pitch the tents of his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful Holy Mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.
DAN.12.1	“Now at that time Michael, the great prince who stands 
DAN.12.2	Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace 
DAN.12.3	Those who have insight will shine brightly like the brightness of the expanse of heaven, and those who lead the many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever. 
DAN.12.4	But as for you, Daniel, conceal these words and seal up the book until the end of time; many will go back and forth, and knowledge will increase.”
DAN.12.5	Then I, Daniel, looked and behold, two others were standing, one on this bank of the river and the other on that bank of the river. 
DAN.12.6	And one said to the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long 
DAN.12.7	I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, as he raised his right hand and his left toward heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half

DAN.12.10	Many will be purged, purified and refined, but the wicked will act wickedly; and none of the wicked will understand, but those who have insight will understand.

HOS.2.3	And expose her as on the day when she was born.
HOS.2.3	I will also make her like a wilderness,
HOS.2.3	Make her like desert land
HOS.2.3	And slay her with thirst.
HOS.2.4	Also, I will have no compassion on her children,
HOS.2.4	Because they are children of harlotry.
HOS.2.5	For their mother has played the harlot;
HOS.2.5	She who conceived them has acted shamefully.
HOS.2.5	For she said, ‘I will go after my lovers,

HOS.4.4	Yet let no one find fault, and let none offer reproof;

HOS.5.10	The princes of Judah have become like those who move a boundary;
HOS.5.10	On them I will pour out My wrath like water.
HOS.5.11	Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment,
HOS.5.11	Because he was determined to follow 
HOS.5.12	Therefore I am like a moth to Ephraim
HOS.5.12	And like rottenness to the house of Judah.
HOS.5.13	When Ephraim saw his sickness,
HOS.5.13	And Judah his wound,
HOS.5.13	Then Ephraim went to Assyria
HOS.5.13	And sent to King Jareb.
HOS.5.13	But he is unable to heal you,
HOS.5.13	Or to cure you of your wound.
HOS.5.14	For I 
HOS.5.14	And like a young lion to the house of Judah.
HOS.5.14	I, even I, will tear to pieces and go away,
HOS.5.14	I will carry away, and there will be none to deliver.
HOS.5.15	I will go away 
HOS.5.15	Until they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face;
HOS.5.15	In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me.
HOS.6.1	“Come, let us return to the L
HOS.6.1	For He has torn 
HOS.6.1	He has wounded 
HOS.6.2	He will revive us after two days;
HOS.6.2	He will raise us up on the third day,
HOS.6.2	That we may live before Him.
HOS.6.3	So let us know, let us press on to know the L
HOS.6.3	His going forth is as certain as the dawn;
HOS.6.3	And He will come to us like the rain,
HOS.6.3	Like the spring rain watering the earth.”
HOS.6.4	What shall I do with you, O Ephraim?
HOS.6.4	What shall I do with you, O Judah?
HOS.6.4	For your loyalty is like a morning cloud
HOS.6.4	And like the dew which goes away early.
HOS.6.5	Therefore I have hewn 
HOS.6.5	I have slain them by the words of My mouth;
HOS.6.5	And the judgments on you are 
HOS.6.6	For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice,
HOS.6.6	And in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
HOS.6.7	But like Adam they have transgressed the covenant;
HOS.6.7	There they have dealt treacherously against Me.
HOS.6.8	Gilead is a city of wrongdoers,
HOS.6.8	Tracked with bloody 
HOS.6.9	And as raiders wait for a man,
HOS.6.9	Surely they have committed crime.
HOS.6.10	In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing;
HOS.6.10	Ephraim’s harlotry is there, Israel has defiled itself.
HOS.6.11	Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you,
HOS.6.11	When I restore the fortunes of My people.
HOS.7.1	When I would heal Israel,
HOS.7.1	The iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered,
HOS.7.1	And the evil deeds of Samaria,
HOS.7.1	For they deal falsely;
HOS.7.1	The thief enters in,
HOS.7.1	Bandits raid outside,
HOS.7.2	And they do not consider in their hearts
HOS.7.2	That I remember all their wickedness.
HOS.7.2	Now their deeds are all around them;
HOS.7.2	They are before My face.
HOS.7.3	With their wickedness they make the king glad,
HOS.7.3	And the princes with their lies.
HOS.7.4	They are all adulterers,
HOS.7.4	Like an oven heated by the baker
HOS.7.4	Who ceases to stir up 
HOS.7.4	From the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
HOS.7.5	On the day of our king, the princes became sick with the heat of wine;
HOS.7.5	He stretched out his hand with scoffers,
HOS.7.6	For their hearts are like an oven
HOS.7.6	Their anger smolders all night,
HOS.7.6	In the morning it burns like a flaming fire.
HOS.7.7	All of them are hot like an oven,
HOS.7.7	And they consume their rulers;
HOS.7.7	All their kings have fallen.
HOS.7.7	None of them calls on Me.
HOS.7.8	Ephraim mixes himself with the nations;
HOS.7.8	Ephraim has become a cake not turned.
HOS.7.9	Strangers devour his strength,
HOS.7.9	Yet he does not know 
HOS.7.9	Gray hairs also are sprinkled on him,
HOS.7.9	Yet he does not know 
HOS.7.10	Though the pride of Israel testifies against him,
HOS.7.10	Yet they have not returned to the L
HOS.7.10	Nor have they sought Him, for all this.
HOS.7.11	So Ephraim has become like a silly dove, without sense;
HOS.7.11	They call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.
HOS.7.12	When they go, I will spread My net over them;
HOS.7.12	I will bring them down like the birds of the sky.
HOS.7.12	I will chastise them in accordance with the proclamation to their assembly.
HOS.7.13	Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me!
HOS.7.13	Destruction is theirs, for they have rebelled against Me!
HOS.7.13	I would redeem them, but they speak lies against Me.
HOS.7.14	And they do not cry to Me from their heart
HOS.7.14	When they wail on their beds;
HOS.7.14	For the sake of grain and new wine they assemble themselves,
HOS.7.14	They turn away from Me.
HOS.7.15	Although I trained 
HOS.7.15	Yet they devise evil against Me.
HOS.7.16	They turn, 
HOS.7.16	They are like a deceitful bow;
HOS.7.16	Their princes will fall by the sword
HOS.7.16	Because of the insolence of their tongue.
HOS.7.16	This 
HOS.8.1	Like an eagle 
HOS.8.1	Because they have transgressed My covenant
HOS.8.1	And rebelled against My law.
HOS.8.2	They cry out to Me,
HOS.8.2	“My God, we of Israel know You!”
HOS.8.3	Israel has rejected the good;
HOS.8.3	The enemy will pursue him.
HOS.8.4	They have set up kings, but not by Me;
HOS.8.4	They have appointed princes, but I did not know 
HOS.8.4	With their silver and gold they have made idols for themselves,
HOS.8.4	That they might be cut off.
HOS.8.5	He has rejected your calf, O Samaria, 
HOS.8.5	“My anger burns against them!”
HOS.8.5	How long will they be incapable of innocence?
HOS.8.6	For from Israel is even this!
HOS.8.6	A craftsman made it, so it is not God;
HOS.8.6	Surely the calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces.
HOS.8.7	For they sow the wind
HOS.8.7	And they reap the whirlwind.
HOS.8.7	The standing grain has no heads;
HOS.8.7	It yields no grain.
HOS.8.7	Should it yield, strangers would swallow it up.
HOS.8.8	Israel is swallowed up;
HOS.8.8	They are now among the nations
HOS.8.8	Like a vessel in which no one delights.
HOS.8.9	For they have gone up to Assyria,
HOS.8.9	Ephraim has hired lovers.
HOS.8.10	Even though they hire 
HOS.8.10	Now I will gather them up;
HOS.8.10	And they will begin to diminish
HOS.8.10	Because of the burden of the king of princes.
HOS.8.11	Since Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin,
HOS.8.11	They have become altars of sinning for him.
HOS.8.12	Though I wrote for him ten thousand 
HOS.8.12	They are regarded as a strange thing.
HOS.8.13	As for My sacrificial gifts,
HOS.8.13	They sacrifice the flesh and eat 
HOS.8.13	Now He will remember their iniquity,
HOS.8.13	And punish 
HOS.8.13	They will return to Egypt.
HOS.8.14	For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces;
HOS.8.14	And Judah has multiplied fortified cities,
HOS.8.14	But I will send a fire on its cities that it may consume its palatial dwellings.
HOS.9.1	Do not rejoice, O Israel, with exultation like the nations!
HOS.9.1	For you have played the harlot, forsaking your God.
HOS.9.1	You have loved 
HOS.9.2	Threshing floor and wine press will not feed them,
HOS.9.2	And the new wine will fail them.
HOS.9.3	They will not remain in the L
HOS.9.3	But Ephraim will return to Egypt,
HOS.9.3	And in Assyria they will eat unclean 
HOS.9.4	They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the L
HOS.9.4	Their sacrifices will not please Him.
HOS.9.4	All who eat of it will be defiled,
HOS.9.4	For their bread will be for themselves 
HOS.9.4	It will not enter the house of the L
HOS.9.5	What will you do on the day of the appointed festival
HOS.9.5	And on the day of the feast of the L
HOS.9.6	For behold, they will go because of destruction;
HOS.9.6	Egypt will gather them up, Memphis will bury them.
HOS.9.6	Weeds will take over their treasures of silver;
HOS.9.6	Thorns 
HOS.9.7	The days of punishment have come,
HOS.9.7	The days of retribution have come;
HOS.9.7	Let Israel know 
HOS.9.7	The prophet is a fool,
HOS.9.7	The inspired man is demented,
HOS.9.7	Because of the grossness of your iniquity,
HOS.9.7	And 
HOS.9.8	Ephraim 
HOS.9.9	They have gone deep in depravity
HOS.9.9	As in the days of Gibeah;
HOS.9.9	He will remember their iniquity,
HOS.9.9	He will punish their sins.
HOS.9.10	I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness;
HOS.9.10	I saw your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first 
HOS.9.10	And they became as detestable as that which they loved.
HOS.9.11	As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird—
HOS.9.11	No birth, no pregnancy and no conception!
HOS.9.12	Though they bring up their children,
HOS.9.12	Yet I will bereave them until not a man is left.
HOS.9.12	Yes, woe to them indeed when I depart from them!
HOS.9.13	Ephraim, as I have seen,
HOS.9.13	Is planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre;
HOS.9.13	But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter.
HOS.9.14	Give them, O L
HOS.9.14	Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
HOS.9.15	All their evil is at Gilgal;
HOS.9.15	Indeed, I came to hate them there!
HOS.9.15	Because of the wickedness of their deeds
HOS.9.15	I will drive them out of My house!
HOS.9.15	I will love them no more;
HOS.9.15	All their princes are rebels.
HOS.9.16	Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up,
HOS.9.16	They will bear no fruit.
HOS.9.16	Even though they bear children,
HOS.9.16	I will slay the precious ones of their womb.
HOS.9.17	My God will cast them away
HOS.9.17	Because they have not listened to Him;
HOS.9.17	And they will be wanderers among the nations.
HOS.10.1	Israel is a luxuriant vine;
HOS.10.1	He produces fruit for himself.
HOS.10.1	The more his fruit,
HOS.10.1	The more altars he made;
HOS.10.1	The richer his land,
HOS.10.1	The better he made the 
HOS.10.2	Their heart is faithless;
HOS.10.2	Now they must bear their guilt.
HOS.10.2	The L
HOS.10.3	Surely now they will say, “We have no king,
HOS.10.3	For we do not revere the L
HOS.10.3	As for the king, what can he do for us?”
HOS.10.4	They speak 
HOS.10.4	With worthless oaths they make covenants;
HOS.10.4	And judgment sprouts like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.
HOS.10.5	The inhabitants of Samaria will fear
HOS.10.5	For the calf of Beth-aven.
HOS.10.5	Indeed, its people will mourn for it,
HOS.10.5	And its idolatrous priests will cry out over it,
HOS.10.5	Over its glory, since it has departed from it.
HOS.10.6	The thing itself will be carried to Assyria
HOS.10.6	As tribute to King Jareb;
HOS.10.6	Ephraim will be seized with shame
HOS.10.6	And Israel will be ashamed of its own counsel.
HOS.10.7	Samaria will be cut off 
HOS.10.7	Like a stick on the surface of the water.
HOS.10.8	Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed;
HOS.10.8	Thorn and thistle will grow on their altars;
HOS.10.8	Then they will say to the mountains,
HOS.10.8	“Cover us!” And to the hills, “Fall on us!”
HOS.10.9	From the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel;
HOS.10.9	There they stand!
HOS.10.9	Will not the battle against the sons of iniquity overtake them in Gibeah?
HOS.10.10	When it is My desire, I will chastise them;
HOS.10.10	And the peoples will be gathered against them
HOS.10.10	When they are bound for their double guilt.
HOS.10.11	Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh,
HOS.10.11	But I will come over her fair neck 
HOS.10.11	I will harness Ephraim,
HOS.10.11	Judah will plow, Jacob will harrow for himself.
HOS.10.12	Sow with a view to righteousness,
HOS.10.12	Reap in accordance with kindness;
HOS.10.12	Break up your fallow ground,
HOS.10.12	For it is time to seek the L
HOS.10.12	Until He comes to rain righteousness on you.
HOS.10.13	You have plowed wickedness, you have reaped injustice,
HOS.10.13	You have eaten the fruit of lies.
HOS.10.13	Because you have trusted in your way, in your numerous warriors,
HOS.10.14	Therefore a tumult will arise among your people,
HOS.10.14	And all your fortresses will be destroyed,
HOS.10.14	As Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle,
HOS.10.15	Thus it will be done to you at Bethel because of your great wickedness.
HOS.10.15	At dawn the king of Israel will be completely cut off.
HOS.11.1	When Israel 
HOS.11.1	And out of Egypt I called My son.
HOS.11.2	The more they called them,
HOS.11.2	The more they went from them;
HOS.11.2	They kept sacrificing to the Baals
HOS.11.2	And burning incense to idols.
HOS.11.3	Yet it is I who taught Ephraim to walk,
HOS.11.3	I took them in My arms;
HOS.11.3	But they did not know that I healed them.
HOS.11.4	I led them with cords of a man, with bonds of love,
HOS.11.4	And I became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws;
HOS.11.4	And I bent down 
HOS.11.5	They will not return to the land of Egypt;
HOS.11.5	But Assyria—he will be their king
HOS.11.5	Because they refused to return 
HOS.11.6	The sword will whirl against their cities,
HOS.11.6	And will demolish their gate bars
HOS.11.6	And consume 
HOS.11.7	So My people are bent on turning from Me.
HOS.11.7	Though they call them to 
HOS.11.7	None at all exalts 
HOS.11.8	How can I give you up, O Ephraim?
HOS.11.8	How can I surrender you, O Israel?
HOS.11.8	How can I make you like Admah?
HOS.11.8	How can I treat you like Zeboiim?
HOS.11.8	My heart is turned over within Me,
HOS.11.8	All My compassions are kindled.
HOS.11.9	I will not execute My fierce anger;
HOS.11.9	I will not destroy Ephraim again.
HOS.11.9	For I am God and not man, the Holy One in your midst,
HOS.11.9	And I will not come in wrath.
HOS.11.10	They will walk after the L
HOS.11.10	He will roar like a lion;
HOS.11.10	Indeed He will roar
HOS.11.10	And 
HOS.11.11	They will come trembling like birds from Egypt
HOS.11.11	And like doves from the land of Assyria;
HOS.11.11	And I will settle them in their houses, declares the L
HOS.11.12	Ephraim surrounds Me with lies
HOS.11.12	And the house of Israel with deceit;
HOS.11.12	Judah is also unruly against God,
HOS.11.12	Even against the Holy One who is faithful.
HOS.12.1	Ephraim feeds on wind,
HOS.12.1	And pursues the east wind continually;
HOS.12.1	He multiplies lies and violence.
HOS.12.1	Moreover, he makes a covenant with Assyria,
HOS.12.1	And oil is carried to Egypt.
HOS.12.2	The L
HOS.12.2	And will punish Jacob according to his ways;
HOS.12.2	He will repay him according to his deeds.
HOS.12.3	In the womb he took his brother by the heel,
HOS.12.3	And in his maturity he contended with God.
HOS.12.4	Yes, he wrestled with the angel and prevailed;
HOS.12.4	He wept and sought His favor.
HOS.12.4	He found Him at Bethel
HOS.12.4	And there He spoke with us,
HOS.12.5	Even the L
HOS.12.5	The L
HOS.12.6	Therefore, return to your God,
HOS.12.6	Observe kindness and justice,
HOS.12.6	And wait for your God continually.
HOS.12.7	A merchant, in whose hands are false balances,
HOS.12.7	He loves to oppress.
HOS.12.8	And Ephraim said, “Surely I have become rich,
HOS.12.8	I have found wealth for myself;
HOS.12.8	In all my labors they will find in me
HOS.12.8	No iniquity, which 
HOS.12.9	But I 
HOS.12.9	I will make you live in tents again,
HOS.12.9	As in the days of the appointed festival.
HOS.12.10	I have also spoken to the prophets,
HOS.12.10	And I gave numerous visions,
HOS.12.10	And through the prophets I gave parables.
HOS.12.11	Is there iniquity 
HOS.12.11	Surely they are worthless.
HOS.12.11	In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls,
HOS.12.11	Yes, their altars are like the stone heaps
HOS.12.11	Beside the furrows of the field.
HOS.12.12	Now Jacob fled to the land of Aram,
HOS.12.12	And Israel worked for a wife,
HOS.12.12	And for a wife he kept 
HOS.12.13	But by a prophet the L
HOS.12.13	And by a prophet he was kept.
HOS.12.14	Ephraim has provoked to bitter anger;
HOS.12.14	So his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him
HOS.12.14	And bring back his reproach to him.
HOS.13.1	When Ephraim spoke, 
HOS.13.1	He exalted himself in Israel,
HOS.13.1	But through Baal he did wrong and died.
HOS.13.2	And now they sin more and more,
HOS.13.2	And make for themselves molten images,
HOS.13.2	Idols skillfully made from their silver,
HOS.13.2	All of them the work of craftsmen.
HOS.13.2	They say of them, “Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves!”
HOS.13.3	Therefore they will be like the morning cloud
HOS.13.3	And like dew which soon disappears,
HOS.13.3	Like chaff which is blown away from the threshing floor
HOS.13.3	And like smoke from a chimney.
HOS.13.4	Yet I 
HOS.13.4	Since the land of Egypt;
HOS.13.4	And you were not to know any god except Me,
HOS.13.4	For there is no savior besides Me.
HOS.13.5	I cared for you in the wilderness,
HOS.13.5	In the land of drought.
HOS.13.6	As 
HOS.13.6	And being satisfied, their heart became proud;
HOS.13.6	Therefore they forgot Me.
HOS.13.7	So I will be like a lion to them;
HOS.13.7	Like a leopard I will lie in wait by the wayside.
HOS.13.8	I will encounter them like a bear robbed of her cubs,
HOS.13.8	And I will tear open their chests;
HOS.13.8	There I will also devour them like a lioness,
HOS.13.9	That 
HOS.13.10	Where now is your king
HOS.13.10	That he may save you in all your cities,
HOS.13.10	And your judges of whom you requested,
HOS.13.10	“Give me a king and princes”?
HOS.13.11	I gave you a king in My anger
HOS.13.11	And took him away in My wrath.
HOS.13.12	The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up;
HOS.13.12	His sin is stored up.
HOS.13.13	The pains of childbirth come upon him;
HOS.13.13	He is not a wise son,
HOS.13.13	For it is not the time that he should delay at the opening of the womb.
HOS.13.14	Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol?
HOS.13.14	Shall I redeem them from death?
HOS.13.14	O Death, where are your thorns?
HOS.13.14	O Sheol, where is your sting?
HOS.13.14	Compassion will be hidden from My sight.
HOS.13.15	Though he flourishes among the reeds,
HOS.13.15	An east wind will come,
HOS.13.15	The wind of the L
HOS.13.15	And his fountain will become dry
HOS.13.15	And his spring will be dried up;
HOS.13.15	It will plunder 
HOS.13.16	Samaria will be held guilty,
HOS.13.16	For she has rebelled against her God.
HOS.13.16	They will fall by the sword,
HOS.13.16	Their little ones will be dashed in pieces,
HOS.13.16	And their pregnant women will be ripped open.
HOS.14.1	Return, O Israel, to the L
HOS.14.1	For you have stumbled because of your iniquity.
HOS.14.2	Take words with you and return to the L
HOS.14.2	Say to Him, “Take away all iniquity
HOS.14.2	And receive 
HOS.14.2	That we may present the fruit of our lips.
HOS.14.3	Assyria will not save us,
HOS.14.3	We will not ride on horses;
HOS.14.3	Nor will we say again, ‘Our god,’
HOS.14.3	To the work of our hands;
HOS.14.3	For in You the orphan finds mercy.”
HOS.14.4	I will heal their apostasy,
HOS.14.4	I will love them freely,
HOS.14.4	For My anger has turned away from them.
HOS.14.5	I will be like the dew to Israel;
HOS.14.5	He will blossom like the lily,
HOS.14.5	And he will take root like 
HOS.14.6	His shoots will sprout,
HOS.14.6	And his beauty will be like the olive tree
HOS.14.6	And his fragrance like 
HOS.14.7	Those who live in his shadow
HOS.14.7	Will again raise grain,
HOS.14.7	And they will blossom like the vine.
HOS.14.7	His renown 
HOS.14.8	O Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols?
HOS.14.8	It is I who answer and look after you.
HOS.14.8	I am like a luxuriant cypress;
HOS.14.8	From Me comes your fruit.
HOS.14.9	Whoever is wise, let him understand these things;
HOS.14.9	For the ways of the L
HOS.14.9	And the righteous will walk in them,
HOS.14.9	But transgressors will stumble in them.
JOL.1.1	The word of the L

JOL.1.5	Awake, drunkards, and weep;
JOL.1.5	And wail, all you wine drinkers,
JOL.1.5	On account of the sweet wine
JOL.1.5	That is cut off from your mouth.

JOL.1.6	Its teeth are the teeth of a lion,

JOL.1.7	It has made my vine a waste
JOL.1.7	And my fig tree splinters.
JOL.1.7	It has stripped them bare and cast 
JOL.1.7	Their branches have become white.

JOL.1.10	The field is ruined,
JOL.1.10	The land mourns;

JOL.1.10	The new wine dries up,
JOL.1.10	Fresh oil fails.
JOL.1.11	Be ashamed, O farmers,
JOL.1.11	Wail, O vinedressers,
JOL.1.11	For the wheat and the barley;
JOL.1.11	Because the harvest of the field is destroyed.

JOL.1.13	Come, spend the night in sackcloth
JOL.1.13	O ministers of my God,
JOL.1.13	For the grain offering and the drink offering
JOL.1.13	Are withheld from the house of your God.

JOL.1.15	Alas for the day!
JOL.1.15	For the day of the L
JOL.1.15	And it will come as destruction from the Almighty.
JOL.1.16	Has not food been cut off before our eyes,
JOL.1.16	Gladness and joy from the house of our God?
JOL.1.17	The seeds shrivel under their clods;
JOL.1.17	The storehouses are desolate,
JOL.1.17	The barns are torn down,
JOL.1.17	For the grain is dried up.
JOL.1.18	How the beasts groan!
JOL.1.18	The herds of cattle wander aimlessly
JOL.1.18	Because there is no pasture for them;
JOL.1.18	Even the flocks of sheep suffer.
JOL.1.19	To You, O L
JOL.1.19	For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness
JOL.1.19	And the flame has burned up all the trees of the field.
JOL.1.20	Even the beasts of the field pant for You;
JOL.1.20	For the water brooks are dried up
JOL.1.20	And fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

JOL.2.1	Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,
JOL.2.1	For the day of the L
JOL.2.1	Surely it is near,
JOL.2.2	A day of darkness and gloom,
JOL.2.2	A day of clouds and thick darkness.
JOL.2.2	As the dawn is spread over the mountains,
JOL.2.2	There has never been 
JOL.2.2	Nor will there be again after it
JOL.2.2	To the years of many generations.
JOL.2.3	A fire consumes before them
JOL.2.3	And behind them a flame burns.
JOL.2.3	The land is like the garden of Eden before them
JOL.2.3	But a desolate wilderness behind them,
JOL.2.3	And nothing at all escapes them.
JOL.2.4	Their appearance is like the appearance of horses;
JOL.2.4	And like war horses, so they run.
JOL.2.5	With a noise as of chariots
JOL.2.5	They leap on the tops of the mountains,
JOL.2.5	Like the crackling of a flame of fire consuming the stubble,
JOL.2.5	Like a mighty people arranged for battle.
JOL.2.6	Before them the people are in anguish;
JOL.2.6	All faces turn pale.
JOL.2.7	They run like mighty men,
JOL.2.7	They climb the wall like soldiers;
JOL.2.7	And they each march in line,
JOL.2.7	Nor do they deviate from their paths.
JOL.2.8	They do not crowd each other,
JOL.2.8	They march everyone in his path;
JOL.2.8	When they burst through the defenses,
JOL.2.8	They do not break ranks.
JOL.2.9	They rush on the city,
JOL.2.9	They run on the wall;
JOL.2.9	They climb into the houses,
JOL.2.9	They enter through the windows like a thief.
JOL.2.10	Before them the earth quakes,
JOL.2.10	The heavens tremble,
JOL.2.10	The sun and the moon grow dark
JOL.2.10	And the stars lose their brightness.
JOL.2.11	The L
JOL.2.11	Surely His camp is very great,

JOL.2.12	“Yet even now,” declares the L

JOL.2.12	And with fasting, weeping and mourning;
JOL.2.13	And rend your heart and not your garments.”
JOL.2.13	Now return to the L
JOL.2.13	For He is gracious and compassionate,
JOL.2.13	Slow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness
JOL.2.13	And relenting of evil.

JOL.2.17	A byword among the nations.
JOL.2.17	Why should they among the peoples say,

JOL.2.20	And its rear guard into the western sea.
JOL.2.20	And its stench will arise and its foul smell will come up,

JOL.2.23	So rejoice, O sons of Zion,

JOL.2.25	That the swarming locust has eaten,
JOL.2.25	The creeping locust, the stripping locust and the gnawing locust,
JOL.2.25	My great army which I sent among you.
JOL.2.26	You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied
JOL.2.26	And praise the name of the L

AMO.5.11	Yet you will not live in them;
AMO.5.11	You have planted pleasant vineyards, yet you will not drink their wine.
AMO.5.12	For I know your transgressions are many and your sins are great,
AMO.5.12	And turn aside the poor in the gate.
AMO.5.13	Therefore at such a time the prudent person keeps silent, for it is an evil time.
AMO.5.14	Seek good and not evil, that you may live;
AMO.5.14	And thus may the L

AMO.5.16	Therefore thus says the L
AMO.5.16	“There is wailing in all the plazas,
AMO.5.16	And in all the streets they say, ‘Alas! Alas!’
AMO.5.16	They also call the farmer to mourning
AMO.5.16	And professional mourners to lamentation.
AMO.5.17	And in all the vineyards 
AMO.5.17	Because I will pass through the midst of you,” says the L
AMO.5.18	Alas, you who are longing for the day of the L
AMO.5.18	For what purpose 
AMO.5.18	It 
AMO.5.19	As when a man flees from a lion
AMO.5.19	And a bear meets him,
AMO.5.19	Or goes home, leans his hand against the wall
AMO.5.19	And a snake bites him.
AMO.5.20	Even gloom with no brightness in it?
AMO.5.21	“I hate, I reject your festivals,
AMO.5.21	Nor do I delight in your solemn assemblies.
AMO.5.22	Even though you offer up to Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings,
AMO.5.22	I will not accept 
AMO.5.22	And I will not 
AMO.5.23	Take away from Me the noise of your songs;
AMO.5.23	I will not even listen to the sound of your harps.
AMO.5.24	But let justice roll down like waters
AMO.5.24	And righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.
AMO.5.25	“Did you present Me with sacrifices and grain offerings in the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel? 
AMO.5.26	You also carried along Sikkuth your king and Kiyyun, your images, the star of your gods which you made for yourselves. 
AMO.5.27	Therefore, I will make you go into exile beyond Damascus,” says the L
AMO.6.1	Woe to those who are at ease in Zion
AMO.6.1	And to those who 
AMO.6.1	The distinguished men of the foremost of nations,
AMO.6.1	To whom the house of Israel comes.
AMO.6.2	Go over to Calneh and look,
AMO.6.2	And go from there to Hamath the great,
AMO.6.2	Then go down to Gath of the Philistines.
AMO.6.2	Are they better than these kingdoms,
AMO.6.2	Or is their territory greater than yours?
AMO.6.3	Do you put off the day of calamity,
AMO.6.3	And would you bring near the seat of violence?
AMO.6.4	Those who recline on beds of ivory
AMO.6.4	And sprawl on their couches,
AMO.6.4	And eat lambs from the flock
AMO.6.4	And calves from the midst of the stall,
AMO.6.5	Who improvise to the sound of the harp,
AMO.6.6	Who drink wine from sacrificial bowls
AMO.6.6	While they anoint themselves with the finest of oils,
AMO.6.6	Yet they have not grieved over the ruin of Joseph.
AMO.6.7	Therefore, they will now go into exile at the head of the exiles,
AMO.6.7	And the sprawlers’ banqueting will pass away.
AMO.6.8	The Lord G
AMO.6.8	“I loathe the arrogance of Jacob,
AMO.6.8	And detest his citadels;
AMO.6.8	Therefore I will deliver up 
AMO.6.9	And it will be, if ten men are left in one house, they will die. 
AMO.6.10	Then one’s uncle, or his undertaker, will lift him up to carry out

AMO.6.12	Or does one plow them with oxen?
AMO.6.12	Yet you have turned justice into poison

AMO.6.14	“And they will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath
AMO.6.14	To the brook of the Arabah.”
AMO.7.1	Thus the Lord G
AMO.7.2	And it came about, when it had finished eating the vegetation of the land, that I said,
AMO.7.2	“Lord G
AMO.7.2	How can Jacob stand,
AMO.7.2	For he is small?”
AMO.7.3	The L
AMO.7.3	“It shall not be,” said the L
AMO.7.4	Thus the Lord G
AMO.7.5	Then I said,
AMO.7.5	“Lord G
AMO.7.5	How can Jacob stand, for he is small?”
AMO.7.6	The L
AMO.7.6	“This too shall not be,” said the Lord G
AMO.7.7	Thus He showed me, and behold, the Lord was standing by a vertical wall with a plumb line in His hand. 
AMO.7.8	The L
AMO.7.8	“Behold I am about to put a plumb line
AMO.7.8	In the midst of My people Israel.
AMO.7.8	I will spare them no longer.
AMO.7.9	The high places of Isaac will be desolated
AMO.7.9	And the sanctuaries of Israel laid waste.
AMO.7.9	Then I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.”
AMO.7.10	Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent 
AMO.7.11	For thus Amos says, ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.’ ” 
AMO.7.12	Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Go, you seer, flee away to the land of Judah and there eat bread and there do your prophesying! 
AMO.7.13	But no longer prophesy at Bethel, for it is a sanctuary of the king and a royal residence.”
AMO.7.14	Then Amos replied to Amaziah, “I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet; for I am a herdsman and a grower of sycamore figs. 
AMO.7.15	But the L
AMO.7.16	Now hear the word of the L
AMO.7.17	Therefore, thus says the L
AMO.8.1	Thus the Lord G
AMO.8.2	He said, “What do you see, Amos?” And I said, “A basket of summer fruit.” Then the L
AMO.8.3	The songs of the palace will turn to wailing in that day,” declares the Lord G
AMO.8.4	Hear this, you who trample the needy, to do away with the humble of the land, 
AMO.8.5	saying,
AMO.8.5	“When will the new moon be over,
AMO.8.5	So that we may sell grain,
AMO.8.5	And the sabbath, that we may open the wheat 
AMO.8.5	To make the bushel smaller and the shekel bigger,
AMO.8.5	And to cheat with dishonest scales,
AMO.8.6	So as to buy the helpless for money
AMO.8.6	And the needy for a pair of sandals,
AMO.8.6	And 
AMO.8.7	The L
AMO.8.7	“Indeed, I will never forget any of their deeds.
AMO.8.8	Because of this will not the land quake
AMO.8.8	And everyone who dwells in it mourn?
AMO.8.8	Indeed, all of it will rise up like the Nile,
AMO.8.8	And it will be tossed about
AMO.8.8	And subside like the Nile of Egypt.
AMO.8.9	It will come about in that day,” declares the Lord G
AMO.8.9	“That I will make the sun go down at noon
AMO.8.9	And make the earth dark in broad daylight.
AMO.8.10	Then I will turn your festivals into mourning
AMO.8.10	And all your songs into lamentation;
AMO.8.10	And I will bring sackcloth on everyone’s loins
AMO.8.10	And baldness on every head.
AMO.8.10	And I will make it like 
AMO.8.10	And the end of it will be like a bitter day.
AMO.8.11	“Behold, days are coming,” declares the Lord G
AMO.8.11	“When I will send a famine on the land,
AMO.8.11	Not a famine for bread or a thirst for water,
AMO.8.11	But rather for hearing the words of the L
AMO.8.12	People will stagger from sea to sea
AMO.8.12	And from the north even to the east;
AMO.8.12	They will go to and fro to seek the word of the L
AMO.8.12	But they will not find 
AMO.8.13	In that day the beautiful virgins
AMO.8.13	And the young men will faint from thirst.
AMO.8.14	Who say, ‘As your god lives, O Dan,’
AMO.8.14	And, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives,’
AMO.8.14	They will fall and not rise again.”
AMO.9.1	I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and He said,
AMO.9.1	“Smite the capitals so that the thresholds will shake,
AMO.9.1	And break them on the heads of them all!
AMO.9.1	Then I will slay the rest of them with the sword;
AMO.9.1	They will not have a fugitive who will flee,
AMO.9.1	Or a refugee who will escape.
AMO.9.2	Though they dig into Sheol,
AMO.9.2	From there will My hand take them;
AMO.9.2	And though they ascend to heaven,
AMO.9.2	From there will I bring them down.
AMO.9.3	Though they hide on the summit of Carmel,
AMO.9.3	I will search them out and take them from there;
AMO.9.3	And though they conceal themselves from My sight on the floor of the sea,
AMO.9.3	From there I will command the serpent and it will bite them.
AMO.9.4	And though they go into captivity before their enemies,
AMO.9.4	From there I will command the sword that it slay them,
AMO.9.4	And I will set My eyes against them for evil and not for good.”
AMO.9.5	The Lord G

JON.1.10	Then the men became extremely frightened and they said to him, “How could you do this?” For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the L
JON.1.11	So they said to him, “What should we do to you that the sea may become calm for us?”—for the sea was becoming increasingly stormy. 
JON.1.12	He said to them, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea. Then the sea will become calm for you, for I know that on account of me this great storm 
JON.1.13	However, the men rowed 
JON.1.14	Then they called on the L
JON.1.15	So they picked up Jonah, threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped its raging. 
JON.1.16	Then the men feared the L
JON.1.17	And the L

JON.2.2	I cried for help from the depth of Sheol;

JON.2.3	All Your breakers and billows passed over me.
JON.2.4	So I said, ‘I have been expelled from Your sight.

JON.2.5	Water encompassed me to the point of death.

JON.3.3	So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh according to the word of the L
JON.3.4	Then Jonah began to go through the city one day’s walk; and he cried out and said, “Yet forty days and Nineveh will be overthrown.”
JON.3.5	Then the people of Nineveh believed in God; and they called a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them. 
JON.3.6	When the word reached the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, laid aside his robe from him, covered 
JON.3.7	He issued a proclamation and it said, “In Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let man, beast, herd, or flock taste a thing. Do not let them eat or drink water. 
JON.3.8	But both man and beast must be covered with sackcloth; and let men call on God earnestly that each may turn from his wicked way and from the violence which is in his hands. 
JON.3.9	Who knows, God may turn and relent and withdraw His burning anger so that we will not perish.”
JON.3.10	When God saw their deeds, that they turned from their wicked way, then God relented concerning the calamity which He had declared He would bring upon them. And He did not do

JON.4.2	He prayed to the L
JON.4.3	Therefore now, O L
JON.4.4	The L

MIC.1.3	He will come down and tread on the high places of the earth.
MIC.1.4	The mountains will melt under Him
MIC.1.4	And the valleys will be split,
MIC.1.4	Like wax before the fire,
MIC.1.4	Like water poured down a steep place.
MIC.1.5	All this is for the rebellion of Jacob
MIC.1.5	And for the sins of the house of Israel.
MIC.1.5	What is the rebellion of Jacob?
MIC.1.5	Is it not Samaria?
MIC.1.5	What is the high place of Judah?
MIC.1.5	Is it not Jerusalem?
MIC.1.6	For I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the open country,
MIC.1.6	Planting places for a vineyard.

MIC.2.8	You strip the robe off the garment
MIC.2.8	From unsuspecting passers-by,
MIC.2.9	The women of My people you evict,
MIC.2.9	Each 
MIC.2.9	From her children you take My splendor forever.
MIC.2.10	Arise and go,
MIC.2.10	For this is no place of rest
MIC.2.10	Because of the uncleanness that brings on destruction,
MIC.2.10	A painful destruction.
MIC.2.11	If a man walking after wind and falsehood
MIC.2.11	Had told lies 
MIC.2.11	‘I will speak out to you concerning wine and liquor,’
MIC.2.11	He would be spokesman to this people.
MIC.2.12	“I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob,
MIC.2.12	I will surely gather the remnant of Israel.
MIC.2.12	I will put them together like sheep in the fold;
MIC.2.12	Like a flock in the midst of its pasture
MIC.2.12	They will be noisy with men.
MIC.2.13	The breaker goes up before them;
MIC.2.13	They break out, pass through the gate and go out by it.
MIC.2.13	So their king goes on before them,
MIC.2.13	And the L
MIC.3.1	And I said,
MIC.3.1	“Hear now, heads of Jacob
MIC.3.1	And rulers of the house of Israel.
MIC.3.1	Is it not for you to know justice?
MIC.3.2	You who hate good and love evil,
MIC.3.2	Who tear off their skin from them
MIC.3.2	And their flesh from their bones,
MIC.3.3	Who eat the flesh of my people,
MIC.3.3	Strip off their skin from them,
MIC.3.3	Break their bones
MIC.3.3	And chop 
MIC.3.3	And as meat in a kettle.”
MIC.3.4	Then they will cry out to the L
MIC.3.4	But He will not answer them.
MIC.3.4	Instead, He will hide His face from them at that time
MIC.3.4	Because they have practiced evil deeds.
MIC.3.5	Thus says the L
MIC.3.5	When they have 
MIC.3.5	They cry, “Peace,”
MIC.3.5	But against him who puts nothing in their mouths
MIC.3.5	They declare holy war.
MIC.3.6	Therefore 
MIC.3.6	And darkness for you—without divination.
MIC.3.6	The sun will go down on the prophets,
MIC.3.6	And the day will become dark over them.
MIC.3.7	The seers will be ashamed
MIC.3.7	And the diviners will be embarrassed.
MIC.3.7	Indeed, they will all cover 
MIC.3.7	Because there is no answer from God.
MIC.3.8	On the other hand I am filled with power—
MIC.3.8	With the Spirit of the L
MIC.3.8	And with justice and courage
MIC.3.8	To make known to Jacob his rebellious act,
MIC.3.8	Even to Israel his sin.
MIC.3.9	Now hear this, heads of the house of Jacob
MIC.3.9	And rulers of the house of Israel,
MIC.3.9	Who abhor justice
MIC.3.9	And twist everything that is straight,
MIC.3.10	Who build Zion with bloodshed
MIC.3.10	And Jerusalem with violent injustice.
MIC.3.11	Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe,
MIC.3.11	Her priests instruct for a price
MIC.3.11	And her prophets divine for money.
MIC.3.11	Yet they lean on the L
MIC.3.11	“Is not the L
MIC.3.11	Calamity will not come upon us.”
MIC.3.12	Therefore, on account of you
MIC.3.12	Zion will be plowed as a field,
MIC.3.12	Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins,
MIC.3.12	And the mountain of the temple 
MIC.4.1	And it will come about in the last days
MIC.4.1	That the mountain of the house of the L
MIC.4.1	Will be established as the chief of the mountains.
MIC.4.1	It will be raised above the hills,
MIC.4.1	And the peoples will stream to it.
MIC.4.2	Many nations will come and say,
MIC.4.2	“Come and let us go up to the mountain of the L
MIC.4.2	And to the house of the God of Jacob,
MIC.4.2	That He may teach us about His ways
MIC.4.2	And that we may walk in His paths.”
MIC.4.2	For from Zion will go forth the law,
MIC.4.2	Even the word of the L
MIC.4.3	And He will judge between many peoples
MIC.4.3	And render decisions for mighty, distant nations.
MIC.4.3	Then they will hammer their swords into plowshares
MIC.4.3	And their spears into pruning hooks;
MIC.4.3	Nation will not lift up sword against nation,
MIC.4.3	And never again will they train for war.
MIC.4.4	Each of them will sit under his vine
MIC.4.4	And under his fig tree,
MIC.4.4	With no one to make 
MIC.4.4	For the mouth of the L
MIC.4.5	Though all the peoples walk
MIC.4.5	Each in the name of his god,
MIC.4.5	As for us, we will walk
MIC.4.5	In the name of the L
MIC.4.6	“In that day,” declares the L
MIC.4.6	“I will assemble the lame
MIC.4.6	And gather the outcasts,
MIC.4.6	Even those whom I have afflicted.
MIC.4.7	I will make the lame a remnant
MIC.4.7	And the outcasts a strong nation,
MIC.4.7	And the L
MIC.4.7	From now on and forever.
MIC.4.8	As for you, tower of the flock,
MIC.4.8	Hill of the daughter of Zion,
MIC.4.8	To you it will come—
MIC.4.8	Even the former dominion will come,
MIC.4.8	The kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
MIC.4.9	“Now, why do you cry out loudly?
MIC.4.9	Is there no king among you,
MIC.4.9	Or has your counselor perished,
MIC.4.9	That agony has gripped you like a woman in childbirth?
MIC.4.10	Writhe and labor to give birth,
MIC.4.10	Daughter of Zion,
MIC.4.10	Like a woman in childbirth;
MIC.4.10	For now you will go out of the city,
MIC.4.10	Dwell in the field,
MIC.4.10	And go to Babylon.
MIC.4.10	There you will be rescued;
MIC.4.10	There the L
MIC.4.10	From the hand of your enemies.
MIC.4.11	And now many nations have been assembled against you
MIC.4.11	Who say, ‘Let her be polluted,
MIC.4.11	And let our eyes gloat over Zion.’
MIC.4.12	But they do not know the thoughts of the L
MIC.4.12	And they do not understand His purpose;
MIC.4.12	For He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.
MIC.4.13	Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion,
MIC.4.13	For your horn I will make iron
MIC.4.13	And your hoofs I will make bronze,
MIC.4.13	That you may pulverize many peoples,
MIC.4.13	That you may devote to the L
MIC.4.13	And their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
MIC.5.1	“Now muster yourselves in troops, daughter of troops;
MIC.5.1	They have laid siege against us;
MIC.5.1	With a rod they will smite the judge of Israel on the cheek.
MIC.5.2	But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
MIC.5.2	From you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in Israel.
MIC.5.2	His goings forth are from long ago,
MIC.5.2	From the days of eternity.”
MIC.5.3	Therefore He will give them 
MIC.5.3	When she who is in labor has borne a child.
MIC.5.3	Then the remainder of His brethren
MIC.5.3	Will return to the sons of Israel.
MIC.5.4	And He will arise and shepherd 
MIC.5.4	In the strength of the L
MIC.5.4	In the majesty of the name of the L
MIC.5.4	And they will remain,
MIC.5.4	Because at that time He will be great
MIC.5.4	To the ends of the earth.
MIC.5.5	This One will be 
MIC.5.5	When he tramples on our citadels,
MIC.5.5	Then we will raise against him
MIC.5.5	Seven shepherds and eight leaders of men.
MIC.5.6	They will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword,
MIC.5.6	The land of Nimrod at its entrances;
MIC.5.6	And He will deliver 
MIC.5.6	When he attacks our land
MIC.5.6	And when he tramples our territory.
MIC.5.7	Then the remnant of Jacob
MIC.5.7	Will be among many peoples
MIC.5.7	Like dew from the L
MIC.5.7	Like showers on vegetation
MIC.5.7	Which do not wait for man
MIC.5.7	Or delay for the sons of men.
MIC.5.8	The remnant of Jacob
MIC.5.8	Will be among the nations,
MIC.5.8	Among many peoples
MIC.5.8	Like a lion among the beasts of the forest,
MIC.5.8	Like a young lion among flocks of sheep,
MIC.5.8	Which, if he passes through,
MIC.5.8	Tramples down and tears,
MIC.5.8	And there is none to rescue.
MIC.5.9	Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries,
MIC.5.9	And all your enemies will be cut off.
MIC.5.10	“It will be in that day,” declares the L
MIC.5.10	“That I will cut off your horses from among you
MIC.5.10	And destroy your chariots.
MIC.5.11	I will also cut off the cities of your land
MIC.5.11	And tear down all your fortifications.
MIC.5.12	I will cut off sorceries from your hand,
MIC.5.12	And you will have fortune-tellers no more.
MIC.5.13	I will cut off your carved images
MIC.5.13	And your 
MIC.5.13	So that you will no longer bow down
MIC.5.13	To the work of your hands.
MIC.5.14	I will root out your Asherim from among you
MIC.5.14	And destroy your cities.
MIC.5.15	And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath
MIC.5.15	On the nations which have not obeyed.”
MIC.6.1	Hear now what the L
MIC.6.1	“Arise, plead your case before the mountains,
MIC.6.1	And let the hills hear your voice.
MIC.6.2	Listen, you mountains, to the indictment of the L
MIC.6.2	And you enduring foundations of the earth,
MIC.6.2	Because the L
MIC.6.2	Even with Israel He will dispute.
MIC.6.3	My people, what have I done to you,
MIC.6.3	And how have I wearied you? Answer Me.
MIC.6.4	Indeed, I brought you up from the land of Egypt
MIC.6.4	And ransomed you from the house of slavery,
MIC.6.4	And I sent before you Moses, Aaron and Miriam.
MIC.6.5	My people, remember now
MIC.6.5	What Balak king of Moab counseled
MIC.6.5	And what Balaam son of Beor answered him,
MIC.6.5	So that you might know the righteous acts of the L
MIC.6.6	With what shall I come to the L
MIC.6.6	Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings,
MIC.6.6	With yearling calves?
MIC.6.7	Does the L
MIC.6.7	In ten thousand rivers of oil?
MIC.6.7	Shall I present my firstborn 
MIC.6.7	The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
MIC.6.8	He has told you, O man, what is good;
MIC.6.8	And what does the L
MIC.6.8	But to do justice, to love kindness,
MIC.6.8	And to walk humbly with your God?
MIC.6.9	The voice of the L
MIC.6.9	And it is sound wisdom to fear Your name:
MIC.6.9	“Hear, O tribe. Who has appointed its time?
MIC.6.10	Is there yet a man in the wicked house,
MIC.6.10	And a short measure 
MIC.6.11	Can I justify wicked scales
MIC.6.11	And a bag of deceptive weights?
MIC.6.12	For the rich men of 
MIC.6.12	Her residents speak lies,
MIC.6.12	And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
MIC.6.13	So also I will make 
MIC.6.13	Desolating 
MIC.6.14	You will eat, but you will not be satisfied,
MIC.6.14	And your 
MIC.6.14	You will 
MIC.6.14	But you will not preserve 
MIC.6.14	And what you do preserve I will give to the sword.
MIC.6.15	You will sow but you will not reap.
MIC.6.15	You will tread the olive but will not anoint yourself with oil;
MIC.6.15	And the grapes, but you will not drink wine.
MIC.6.16	The statutes of Omri
MIC.6.16	And all the works of the house of Ahab are observed;
MIC.6.16	And in their devices you walk.
MIC.6.16	Therefore I will give you up for destruction
MIC.6.16	And your inhabitants for derision,
MIC.6.16	And you will bear the reproach of My people.”
MIC.7.1	Woe is me! For I am
MIC.7.1	Like the fruit pickers, like the grape gatherers.
MIC.7.1	There is not a cluster of grapes to eat,
MIC.7.2	The godly person has perished from the land,
MIC.7.2	And there is no upright 
MIC.7.2	All of them lie in wait for bloodshed;
MIC.7.2	Each of them hunts the other with a net.
MIC.7.3	Concerning evil, both hands do it well.
MIC.7.3	The prince asks, also the judge, for a bribe,
MIC.7.3	And a great man speaks the desire of his soul;
MIC.7.3	So they weave it together.
MIC.7.4	The best of them is like a briar,
MIC.7.4	The most upright like a thorn hedge.
MIC.7.4	The day when you post your watchmen,
MIC.7.4	Your punishment will come.
MIC.7.4	Then their confusion will occur.
MIC.7.5	Do not trust in a neighbor;
MIC.7.5	Do not have confidence in a friend.
MIC.7.5	From her who lies in your bosom
MIC.7.5	Guard your lips.
MIC.7.6	For son treats father contemptuously,
MIC.7.6	Daughter rises up against her mother,
MIC.7.6	Daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
MIC.7.6	A man’s enemies are the men of his own household.
MIC.7.7	But as for me, I will watch expectantly for the L
MIC.7.7	I will wait for the God of my salvation.
MIC.7.7	My God will hear me.
MIC.7.8	Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy.
MIC.7.8	Though I fall I will rise;
MIC.7.8	Though I dwell in darkness, the L
MIC.7.9	I will bear the indignation of the L
MIC.7.9	Because I have sinned against Him,
MIC.7.9	Until He pleads my case and executes justice for me.
MIC.7.9	He will bring me out to the light,
MIC.7.10	Then my enemy will see,
MIC.7.10	And shame will cover her who said to me,
MIC.7.10	“Where is the L
MIC.7.10	My eyes will look on her;
MIC.7.10	At that time she will be trampled down
MIC.7.10	Like mire of the streets.
MIC.7.11	On that day will your boundary be extended.
MIC.7.12	It 
MIC.7.12	From Assyria and the cities of Egypt,
MIC.7.12	From Egypt even to the Euphrates,
MIC.7.12	Even from sea to sea and mountain to mountain.
MIC.7.13	And the earth will become desolate because of her inhabitants,
MIC.7.13	On account of the fruit of their deeds.
MIC.7.14	Shepherd Your people with Your scepter,
MIC.7.14	The flock of Your possession
MIC.7.14	Which dwells by itself in the woodland,
MIC.7.14	In the midst of a fruitful field.
MIC.7.14	Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead
MIC.7.14	As in the days of old.
MIC.7.15	“As in the days when you came out from the land of Egypt,
MIC.7.15	I will show you miracles.”
MIC.7.16	Nations will see and be ashamed
MIC.7.16	Of all their might.
MIC.7.16	They will put 
MIC.7.16	Their ears will be deaf.
MIC.7.17	They will lick the dust like a serpent,
MIC.7.17	Like reptiles of the earth.
MIC.7.17	They will come trembling out of their fortresses;
MIC.7.17	To the L
MIC.7.17	And they will be afraid before You.
MIC.7.18	Who is a God like You, who pardons iniquity
MIC.7.18	And passes over the rebellious act of the remnant of His possession?
MIC.7.18	He does not retain His anger forever,
MIC.7.18	Because He delights in unchanging love.
MIC.7.19	He will again have compassion on us;
MIC.7.19	He will tread our iniquities under foot.
MIC.7.19	Yes, You will cast all their sins
MIC.7.19	Into the depths of the sea.
MIC.7.20	You will give truth to Jacob
MIC.7.20	Which You swore to our forefathers
MIC.7.20	From the days of old.
NAM.1.1	The 
NAM.1.2	A jealous and avenging God is the L
NAM.1.2	The L
NAM.1.2	The L
NAM.1.2	And He reserves wrath for His enemies.
NAM.1.3	The L
NAM.1.3	And the L
NAM.1.3	In whirlwind and storm is His way,
NAM.1.3	And clouds are the dust beneath His feet.
NAM.1.4	He rebukes the sea and makes it dry;
NAM.1.4	He dries up all the rivers.
NAM.1.4	Bashan and Carmel wither;
NAM.1.4	The blossoms of Lebanon wither.
NAM.1.5	Mountains quake because of Him
NAM.1.5	And the hills dissolve;
NAM.1.5	Indeed the earth is upheaved by His presence,
NAM.1.5	The world and all the inhabitants in it.
NAM.1.6	Who can stand before His indignation?
NAM.1.6	Who can endure the burning of His anger?
NAM.1.6	His wrath is poured out like fire
NAM.1.6	And the rocks are broken up by Him.
NAM.1.7	The L
NAM.1.7	A stronghold in the day of trouble,
NAM.1.7	And He knows those who take refuge in Him.
NAM.1.8	But with an overflowing flood
NAM.1.8	He will make a complete end of its site,
NAM.1.8	And will pursue His enemies into darkness.
NAM.1.9	Whatever you devise against the L
NAM.1.9	He will make a complete end of it.
NAM.1.9	Distress will not rise up twice.
NAM.1.10	Like tangled thorns,
NAM.1.10	And like those who are drunken with their drink,
NAM.1.10	They are consumed
NAM.1.10	As stubble completely withered.
NAM.1.11	From you has gone forth
NAM.1.11	One who plotted evil against the L
NAM.1.11	A wicked counselor.
NAM.1.12	Thus says the L
NAM.1.12	“Though they are at full 
NAM.1.12	Even so, they will be cut off and pass away.
NAM.1.12	Though I have afflicted you,

NAM.1.14	The L
NAM.1.14	“Your name will no longer be perpetuated.
NAM.1.14	I will cut off idol and image
NAM.1.14	From the house of your gods.
NAM.1.14	I will prepare your grave,

NAM.1.15	Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news,
NAM.1.15	Who announces peace!
NAM.1.15	Celebrate your feasts, O Judah;
NAM.1.15	Pay your vows.
NAM.1.15	For never again will the wicked one pass through you;
NAM.1.15	He is cut off completely.
NAM.2.1	The one who scatters has come up against you.
NAM.2.1	Man the fortress, watch the road;
NAM.2.1	Strengthen your back, summon all 
NAM.2.2	For the L
NAM.2.2	Like the splendor of Israel,
NAM.2.2	Even though devastators have devastated them
NAM.2.2	And destroyed their vine branches.
NAM.2.3	The shields of his mighty men are 
NAM.2.3	The warriors are dressed in scarlet,
NAM.2.3	The chariots are 
NAM.2.3	When he is prepared 
NAM.2.3	And the cypress 
NAM.2.4	The chariots race madly in the streets,
NAM.2.4	They rush wildly in the squares,
NAM.2.4	Their appearance is like torches,
NAM.2.4	They dash to and fro like lightning flashes.
NAM.2.5	He remembers his nobles;
NAM.2.5	They stumble in their march,
NAM.2.5	They hurry to her wall,
NAM.2.5	And the mantelet is set up.
NAM.2.6	The gates of the rivers are opened
NAM.2.6	And the palace is dissolved.
NAM.2.7	It is fixed:
NAM.2.7	She is stripped, she is carried away,
NAM.2.7	And her handmaids are moaning like the sound of doves,
NAM.2.7	Beating on their breasts.
NAM.2.8	Though Nineveh 
NAM.2.8	Now they are fleeing;
NAM.2.8	“Stop, stop,”
NAM.2.8	But no one turns back.
NAM.2.9	Plunder the silver!
NAM.2.9	Plunder the gold!
NAM.2.9	For there is no limit to the treasure—
NAM.2.9	Wealth from every kind of desirable object.
NAM.2.10	She is emptied! Yes, she is desolate and waste!
NAM.2.10	Hearts are melting and knees knocking!
NAM.2.10	Also anguish is in the whole body
NAM.2.10	And all their faces are grown pale!
NAM.2.11	Where is the den of the lions
NAM.2.11	And the feeding place of the young lions,
NAM.2.11	Where the lion, lioness and lion’s cub prowled,
NAM.2.11	With nothing to disturb 
NAM.2.12	The lion tore enough for his cubs,
NAM.2.12	Killed 
NAM.2.12	And filled his lairs with prey
NAM.2.12	And his dens with torn flesh.
NAM.2.13	“Behold, I am against you,” declares the L
NAM.3.1	Woe to the bloody city, completely full of lies 
NAM.3.2	The noise of the whip,
NAM.3.2	The noise of the rattling of the wheel,
NAM.3.2	Galloping horses
NAM.3.2	And bounding chariots!
NAM.3.3	Horsemen charging,
NAM.3.3	Swords flashing, spears gleaming,
NAM.3.3	Many slain, a mass of corpses,
NAM.3.3	And countless dead bodies—
NAM.3.3	They stumble over the dead bodies!
NAM.3.4	The charming one, the mistress of sorceries,
NAM.3.4	Who sells nations by her harlotries
NAM.3.4	And families by her sorceries.
NAM.3.5	“Behold, I am against you,” declares the L
NAM.3.5	“And I will lift up your skirts over your face,
NAM.3.5	And show to the nations your nakedness
NAM.3.5	And to the kingdoms your disgrace.
NAM.3.6	I will throw filth on you
NAM.3.6	And make you vile,
NAM.3.6	And set you up as a spectacle.
NAM.3.7	And it will come about that all who see you
NAM.3.7	Will shrink from you and say,
NAM.3.7	‘Nineveh is devastated!
NAM.3.7	Who will grieve for her?’
NAM.3.7	Where will I seek comforters for you?”
NAM.3.8	Are you better than 
NAM.3.8	Which was situated by the waters of the Nile,
NAM.3.8	With water surrounding her,
NAM.3.8	Whose rampart 
NAM.3.8	Whose wall 
NAM.3.9	Ethiopia was 
NAM.3.9	And Egypt too, without limits.
NAM.3.9	Put and Lubim were among her helpers.
NAM.3.10	Yet she became an exile,
NAM.3.10	She went into captivity;
NAM.3.10	Also her small children were dashed to pieces
NAM.3.10	At the head of every street;
NAM.3.10	They cast lots for her honorable men,
NAM.3.10	And all her great men were bound with fetters.
NAM.3.11	You too will become drunk,
NAM.3.11	You will be hidden.
NAM.3.11	You too will search for a refuge from the enemy.
NAM.3.12	All your fortifications are fig trees with ripe fruit—
NAM.3.12	When shaken, they fall into the eater’s mouth.
NAM.3.13	Behold, your people are women in your midst!
NAM.3.13	The gates of your land are opened wide to your enemies;
NAM.3.13	Fire consumes your gate bars.
NAM.3.14	Draw for yourself water for the siege!
NAM.3.14	Strengthen your fortifications!
NAM.3.14	Go into the clay and tread the mortar!
NAM.3.14	Take hold of the brick mold!
NAM.3.15	There fire will consume you,
NAM.3.15	The sword will cut you down;
NAM.3.15	It will consume you as the locust 
NAM.3.15	Multiply yourself like the swarming locust.
NAM.3.16	You have increased your traders more than the stars of heaven—
NAM.3.16	The creeping locust strips and flies away.
NAM.3.17	Your guardsmen are like the swarming locust.
NAM.3.17	Your marshals are like hordes of grasshoppers
NAM.3.17	Settling in the stone walls on a cold day.
NAM.3.17	The sun rises and they flee,
NAM.3.17	And the place where they are is not known.
NAM.3.18	Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria;
NAM.3.18	Your nobles are lying down.
NAM.3.18	Your people are scattered on the mountains
NAM.3.18	And there is no one to regather 
NAM.3.19	There is no relief for your breakdown,
NAM.3.19	Your wound is incurable.
NAM.3.19	All who hear about you

HAB.1.1	The

HAB.1.2	I cry out to You, “Violence!”
HAB.1.2	Yet You do not save.
HAB.1.3	Why do You make me see iniquity,
HAB.1.3	And cause 
HAB.1.3	Yes, destruction and violence are before me;
HAB.1.3	Strife exists and contention arises.
HAB.1.4	Therefore the law is ignored
HAB.1.4	And justice is never upheld.

HAB.1.6	That fierce and impetuous people
HAB.1.6	Who march throughout the earth
HAB.1.6	To seize dwelling places which are not theirs.
HAB.1.7	They are dreaded and feared;
HAB.1.7	Their justice and authority originate with themselves.
HAB.1.8	Their horses are swifter than leopards
HAB.1.8	And keener than wolves in the evening.
HAB.1.8	Their horsemen come galloping,
HAB.1.8	Their horsemen come from afar;
HAB.1.8	They fly like an eagle swooping 
HAB.1.9	All of them come for violence.
HAB.1.9	Their horde of faces 
HAB.1.9	They collect captives like sand.
HAB.1.10	They mock at kings
HAB.1.10	And rulers are a laughing matter to them.
HAB.1.10	They laugh at every fortress
HAB.1.10	And heap up rubble to capture it.
HAB.1.11	Then they will sweep through

HAB.1.11	They whose strength is their god.”
HAB.1.12	Are You not from everlasting,
HAB.1.12	O L
HAB.1.12	We will not die.
HAB.1.12	You, O L
HAB.1.12	And You, O Rock, have established them to correct.
HAB.1.13	And You can not look on wickedness 
HAB.1.13	Why do You look with favor
HAB.1.13	On those who deal treacherously?
HAB.1.13	Why are You silent when the wicked swallow up
HAB.1.13	Those more righteous than they?
HAB.1.14	Like creeping things without a ruler over them?
HAB.1.15	Drag them away with their net,
HAB.1.15	And gather them together in their fishing net.
HAB.1.15	Therefore they rejoice and are glad.
HAB.1.16	Therefore they offer a sacrifice to their net
HAB.1.16	And burn incense to their fishing net;
HAB.1.16	Because through these things their catch is large,
HAB.1.16	And their food is plentiful.
HAB.1.17	Will they therefore empty their net
HAB.1.17	And continually slay nations without sparing?
HAB.2.1	I will stand on my guard post
HAB.2.1	And station myself on the rampart;

HAB.2.5	He enlarges his appetite like Sheol,

HAB.2.5	He also gathers to himself all nations
HAB.2.5	And collects to himself all peoples.

HAB.2.6	Even mockery 
HAB.2.6	And say, ‘Woe to him who increases what is not his—

HAB.2.7	Will not your creditors rise up suddenly,
HAB.2.7	And those who collect from you awaken?
HAB.2.7	Indeed, you will become plunder for them.
HAB.2.8	Because you have looted many nations,
HAB.2.8	All the remainder of the peoples will loot you—

HAB.2.9	“Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house

HAB.3.3	God comes from Teman,

HAB.3.3	His splendor covers the heavens,

HAB.3.4	He has rays 
HAB.3.4	And there is the hiding of His power.
HAB.3.5	Before Him goes pestilence,
HAB.3.5	And plague comes after Him.
HAB.3.6	He stood and surveyed the earth;
HAB.3.6	He looked and startled the nations.
HAB.3.6	Yes, the perpetual mountains were shattered,
HAB.3.6	The ancient hills collapsed.
HAB.3.6	His ways are everlasting.
HAB.3.7	I saw the tents of Cushan under distress,
HAB.3.7	The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling.

HAB.3.8	That You rode on Your horses,

HAB.3.12	In indignation You marched through the earth;
HAB.3.12	In anger You trampled the nations.
HAB.3.13	You went forth for the salvation of Your people,
HAB.3.13	For the salvation of Your anointed.
HAB.3.13	You struck the head of the house of the evil
HAB.3.13	To lay him open from thigh to neck. Selah.
HAB.3.14	You pierced with his own spears
HAB.3.14	The head of his throngs.
HAB.3.14	They stormed in to scatter us;
HAB.3.14	Their exultation 
HAB.3.14	Who devour the oppressed in secret.
HAB.3.15	You trampled on the sea with Your horses,
HAB.3.15	On the surge of many waters.
HAB.3.16	I heard and my inward parts trembled,
HAB.3.16	At the sound my lips quivered.
HAB.3.16	Decay enters my bones,

HAB.3.16	Because I must wait quietly for the day of distress,
HAB.3.16	For the people to arise

ZEP.3.3	Her princes within her are roaring lions,

ZEC.2.2	So I said, “Where are you going?” And he said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.” 
ZEC.2.3	And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, 
ZEC.2.4	and said to him, “Run, speak to that young man, saying, ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. 
ZEC.2.5	For I,’ declares the L

ZEC.3.3	Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. 
ZEC.3.4	He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, “Remove the filthy garments from him.” Again he said to him, “See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.” 
ZEC.3.5	Then I said, “Let them put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the L
ZEC.3.6	And the angel of the L
ZEC.3.7	“Thus says the L
ZEC.3.8	Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. 
ZEC.3.9	For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,’ declares the L
ZEC.3.10	In that day,’ declares the L
ZEC.4.1	Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. 
ZEC.4.2	He said to me, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; 
ZEC.4.3	also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.” 
ZEC.4.4	Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, “What are these, my lord?” 
ZEC.4.5	So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” And I said, “No, my lord.” 
ZEC.4.6	Then he said to me, “This is the word of the L

ZEC.4.10	For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—
ZEC.4.11	Then I said to him, “What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?” 
ZEC.4.12	And I answered the second time and said to him, “What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden 
ZEC.4.13	So he answered me, saying, “Do you not know what these are?” And I said, “No, my lord.” 
ZEC.4.14	Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.”
ZEC.5.1	Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, 
ZEC.5.2	And he said to me, “What do you see?” And I answered, “I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.” 
ZEC.5.3	Then he said to me, “This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. 
ZEC.5.4	I will make it go forth,” declares the L
ZEC.5.5	Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, “Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.” 
ZEC.5.6	I said, “What is it?” And he said, “This is the ephah going forth.” Again he said, “This is their appearance in all the land 
ZEC.5.7	(and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.” 
ZEC.5.8	Then he said, “This is Wickedness!” And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening. 
ZEC.5.9	Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. 
ZEC.5.10	I said to the angel who was speaking with me, “Where are they taking the ephah?” 
ZEC.5.11	Then he said to me, “To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.”
ZEC.6.1	Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains 
ZEC.6.2	With the first chariot 
ZEC.6.3	with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses. 
ZEC.6.4	Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these, my lord?” 
ZEC.6.5	The angel replied to me, “These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, 
ZEC.6.6	with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. 
ZEC.6.7	When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.” And He said, “Go, patrol the earth.” So they patrolled the earth. 
ZEC.6.8	Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, “See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.”

ZEC.10.9	When I scatter them among the peoples,
ZEC.10.9	They will remember Me in far countries,
ZEC.10.9	And they with their children will live and come back.
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them back from the land of Egypt
ZEC.10.10	And gather them from Assyria;

ZEC.11.2	Wail, O oaks of Bashan,
ZEC.11.2	For the impenetrable forest has come down.
ZEC.11.3	There is a sound of the shepherds’ wail,
ZEC.11.3	For their glory is ruined;
ZEC.11.3	There is a sound of the young lions’ roar,
ZEC.11.3	For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.
ZEC.11.4	Thus says the L
ZEC.11.5	Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and

ZEC.11.8	Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. 
ZEC.11.9	Then I said, “I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another’s flesh.” 
ZEC.11.10	I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. 
ZEC.11.11	So it was broken on that day, and 
ZEC.11.12	I said to them, “If it is good in your sight, give

ZEC.12.11	In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. 
ZEC.12.12	The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; 
ZEC.12.13	the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; 
ZEC.12.14	all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves.
ZEC.13.1	“In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.

ZEC.13.9	And test them as gold is tested.
ZEC.13.9	They will call on My name,

ZEC.14.3	Then the L
ZEC.14.4	In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. 
ZEC.14.5	You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the L

ZEC.14.7	For it will be a unique day which is known to the L
ZEC.14.8	And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter.
ZEC.14.9	And the L
ZEC.14.10	All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin’s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s wine presses. 
ZEC.14.11	People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security.
ZEC.14.12	Now this will be the plague with which the L

ZEC.14.14	Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance. 
ZEC.14.15	So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps.
ZEC.14.16	Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the L
ZEC.14.17	And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the L
ZEC.14.18	If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no

MAT.1.1	The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
MAT.1.2	Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of 
MAT.1.3	Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez was the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram. 
MAT.1.4	Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon. 
MAT.1.5	Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz was the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse. 
MAT.1.6	Jesse was the father of David the king.
MAT.1.7	Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa. 
MAT.1.8	Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah. 
MAT.1.9	Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah. 
MAT.1.10	Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah. 
MAT.1.11	Josiah became the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
MAT.1.12	After the deportation to Babylon: Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel. 
MAT.1.13	Zerubbabel was the father of Abihud, Abihud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor. 
MAT.1.14	Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud. 
MAT.1.15	Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob. 
MAT.1.16	Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called the Messiah.
MAT.1.17	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations.
MAT.1.18	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit. 
MAT.1.19	And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her, planned 
MAT.1.20	But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been 
MAT.1.21	She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.” 
MAT.1.22	Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet: 
MAT.1.23	“B
MAT.1.24	And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took 
MAT.1.25	but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he called His name Jesus.
MAT.2.1	Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, 
MAT.2.2	“Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.” 
MAT.2.3	When Herod the king heard 
MAT.2.4	Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. 
MAT.2.5	They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea; for this is what has been written by the prophet:
MAT.2.6	‘A
MAT.2.6	A
MAT.2.6	F
MAT.2.6	W
MAT.2.7	Then Herod secretly called the magi and determined from them the exact time the star appeared. 
MAT.2.8	And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the Child; and when you have found 
MAT.2.9	After hearing the king, they went their way; and the star, which they had seen in the east, went on before them until it came and stood over 
MAT.2.10	When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. 
MAT.2.11	After coming into the house they saw the Child with Mary His mother; and they fell to the ground and worshiped Him. Then, opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. 
MAT.2.12	And having been warned 
MAT.2.13	Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up! Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the Child to destroy Him.”
MAT.2.14	So Joseph got up and took the Child and His mother while it was still night, and left for Egypt. 
MAT.2.15	He remained there until the death of Herod. 
MAT.2.16	Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi, he became very enraged, and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and all its vicinity, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the magi. 
MAT.2.17	Then what had been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:
MAT.2.18	“A 
MAT.2.18	W
MAT.2.18	R
MAT.2.18	A
MAT.2.18	B
MAT.2.19	But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said, 
MAT.2.20	“Get up, take the Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel; for those who sought the Child’s life are dead.” 
MAT.2.21	So Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel. 
MAT.2.22	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Then after being warned 
MAT.2.23	and came and lived in a city called Nazareth. 
MAT.3.1	Now in those days John the Baptist *came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, 
MAT.3.2	“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” 
MAT.3.3	For this is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet when he said,
MAT.3.3	“T
MAT.3.3	‘M
MAT.3.3	M
MAT.3.4	Now John himself had a garment of camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey. 
MAT.3.5	Then Jerusalem was going out to him, and all Judea and all the district around the Jordan; 
MAT.3.6	and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.
MAT.3.7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 
MAT.3.8	Therefore bear fruit in keeping with repentance; 
MAT.3.9	and do not suppose that you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father’; for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham. 
MAT.3.10	The axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
MAT.3.11	“As for me, I baptize you 
MAT.3.12	His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor; and He will gather His wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
MAT.3.13	Then Jesus *arrived from Galilee at the Jordan 
MAT.3.14	But John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?” 
MAT.3.15	But Jesus answering said to him, 
MAT.3.16	After being baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove 
MAT.3.17	and behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is 
MAT.4.1	Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 
MAT.4.2	And after He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He 
MAT.4.3	And the tempter came and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.” 
MAT.4.4	But He answered and said, 
MAT.4.5	Then the devil *took Him into the holy city and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, 
MAT.4.6	and *said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down; for it is written,
MAT.4.6	‘H
MAT.4.6	and
MAT.4.6	‘O
MAT.4.6	S
MAT.4.7	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.4.8	Again, the devil *took Him to a very high mountain and *showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory; 
MAT.4.9	and he said to Him, “All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.” 
MAT.4.10	Then Jesus *said to him, 
MAT.4.11	Then the devil *left Him; and behold, angels came and 
MAT.4.12	Now when Jesus heard that John had been taken into custody, He withdrew into Galilee; 
MAT.4.13	and leaving Nazareth, He came and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali. 
MAT.4.14	 to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet:
MAT.4.15	“T
MAT.4.15	B
MAT.4.16	T
MAT.4.16	A
MAT.4.16	U
MAT.4.17	From that time Jesus began to preach and say, 
MAT.4.18	Now as Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. 
MAT.4.19	And He *said to them, 
MAT.4.20	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him. 
MAT.4.21	Going on from there He saw two other brothers, James the 
MAT.4.22	Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.
MAT.4.23	Jesus was going throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people.
MAT.4.24	The news about Him spread throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all who were ill, those suffering with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics; and He healed them. 
MAT.4.25	Large crowds followed Him from Galilee and 
MAT.5.1	When Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain; and after He sat down, His disciples came to Him. 
MAT.5.2	He opened His mouth and 
MAT.7.28	When Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were amazed at His teaching; 
MAT.7.29	for He was teaching them as 
MAT.8.1	When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him. 
MAT.8.2	And a leper came to Him and bowed down before Him, and said, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” 
MAT.8.3	Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, 
MAT.8.4	And Jesus *said to him, 
MAT.8.5	And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, imploring Him, 
MAT.8.6	and saying, “Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, fearfully tormented.” 
MAT.8.7	Jesus *said to him, 
MAT.8.8	But the centurion said, “Lord, I am not worthy for You to come under my roof, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 
MAT.8.9	For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does 
MAT.8.10	Now when Jesus heard 
MAT.8.13	And Jesus said to the centurion, 
MAT.8.14	When Jesus came into Peter’s home, He saw his mother-in-law lying sick in bed with a fever. 
MAT.8.15	He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up and waited on Him. 
MAT.8.16	When evening came, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed; and He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were ill. 
MAT.8.17	 to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet: “H
MAT.8.18	Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side 
MAT.8.19	Then a scribe came and said to Him, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.” 
MAT.8.20	Jesus *said to him, 
MAT.8.21	Another of the disciples said to Him, “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.” 
MAT.8.22	But Jesus *said to him, 
MAT.8.23	When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him. 
MAT.8.24	And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being covered with the waves; but Jesus Himself was asleep. 
MAT.8.25	And they came to 
MAT.8.26	He *said to them, 
MAT.8.27	The men were amazed, and said, “What kind of a man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”
MAT.8.28	When He came to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, two men who were demon-possessed met Him as they were coming out of the tombs. 
MAT.8.29	And they cried out, saying, “What business do we have with each other, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?” 
MAT.8.30	Now there was a herd of many swine feeding at a distance from them. 
MAT.8.31	The demons 
MAT.8.32	And He said to them, 
MAT.8.33	The herdsmen ran away, and went to the city and reported everything, including what had happened to the demoniacs. 
MAT.8.34	And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they implored Him to leave their region.
MAT.9.1	Getting into a boat, Jesus crossed over 
MAT.9.2	And they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, 
MAT.9.3	And some of the scribes said to themselves, “This 
MAT.9.4	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, 
MAT.9.6	—then He *said to the paralytic, 
MAT.9.7	And he got up and went home. 
MAT.9.8	But when the crowds saw 
MAT.9.9	As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man called Matthew, sitting in the tax collector’s booth; and He *said to him, 
MAT.9.10	Then it happened that as Jesus was reclining 
MAT.9.11	When the Pharisees saw 
MAT.9.12	But when Jesus heard 
MAT.9.14	Then the disciples of John *came to Him, asking, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?” 
MAT.9.15	And Jesus said to them, 
MAT.9.18	While He was saying these things to them, a 
MAT.9.19	Jesus got up and 
MAT.9.20	And a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years, came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak; 
MAT.9.21	for she was saying to herself, “If I only touch His garment, I will get well.” 
MAT.9.22	But Jesus turning and seeing her said, 
MAT.9.23	When Jesus came into the official’s house, and saw the flute-players and the crowd in noisy disorder, 
MAT.9.24	He said, 
MAT.9.25	But when the crowd had been sent out, He entered and took her by the hand, and the girl got up. 
MAT.9.26	This news spread throughout all that land.
MAT.9.27	As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!” 
MAT.9.28	When He entered the house, the blind men came up to Him, and Jesus *said to them, 
MAT.9.29	Then He touched their eyes, saying, 
MAT.9.30	And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them: 
MAT.9.31	But they went out and spread the news about Him throughout all that land.
MAT.9.32	As they were going out, a mute, demon-possessed man was brought to Him. 
MAT.9.33	After the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds were amazed, 
MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees were saying, “He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons.”
MAT.9.35	Jesus was going through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
MAT.9.36	Seeing the people, He felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd. 
MAT.9.37	Then He *said to His disciples, 
MAT.10.1	Jesus summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
MAT.10.2	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; 
MAT.10.3	Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 
MAT.10.4	Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Him.
MAT.10.5	These twelve Jesus sent out after instructing them: 
MAT.11.1	When Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.
MAT.11.2	Now when John, while imprisoned, heard of the works of Christ, he sent 
MAT.11.3	and said to Him, “Are You the Expected One, or shall we look for someone else?” 
MAT.11.4	Jesus answered and said to them, 
MAT.11.7	As these men were going 
MAT.11.20	Then He began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles were done, because they did not repent. 
MAT.11.25	At that time Jesus said, 
MAT.12.1	At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples became hungry and began to pick the heads 
MAT.12.2	But when the Pharisees saw 
MAT.12.3	But He said to them, 
MAT.12.9	Departing from there, He went into their synagogue. 
MAT.12.10	And a man 
MAT.12.11	And He said to them, 
MAT.12.13	Then He *said to the man, 
MAT.12.14	But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Him, 
MAT.12.15	But Jesus, aware of 
MAT.12.16	and warned them not to tell who He was. 
MAT.12.17	 to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet:

MAT.12.21	A
MAT.12.22	Then a demon-possessed man 
MAT.12.23	All the crowds were amazed, and were saying, “This man cannot be the Son of David, can he?” 
MAT.12.24	But when the Pharisees heard 
MAT.12.25	And knowing their thoughts Jesus said to them, 
MAT.12.38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.” 
MAT.12.39	But He answered and said to them, 
MAT.12.46	While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and brothers were standing outside, seeking to speak to Him. 
MAT.12.47	Someone said to Him, “Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside seeking to speak to You.” 
MAT.12.48	But Jesus answered the one who was telling Him and said, 
MAT.12.49	And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, 
MAT.13.1	That day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting by the sea. 
MAT.13.2	And large crowds gathered to Him, so He got into a boat and sat down, and the whole crowd was standing on the beach.
MAT.13.3	And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, 
MAT.13.10	And the disciples came and said to Him, “Why do You speak to them in parables?” 
MAT.13.11	Jesus answered them, 
MAT.13.24	Jesus presented another parable to them, saying, 
MAT.13.31	He presented another parable to them, saying, 
MAT.13.33	He spoke another parable to them, 
MAT.13.34	All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and He did not speak to them without a parable. 
MAT.13.35	 to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:
MAT.13.35	“I 
MAT.13.35	I 
MAT.13.36	Then He left the crowds and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.” 
MAT.13.37	And He said, 
MAT.13.52	And Jesus said to them, 
MAT.13.53	When Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there. 
MAT.13.54	He came to His hometown and 
MAT.13.55	Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? 
MAT.13.56	And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then 
MAT.13.57	And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, 
MAT.13.58	And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
MAT.14.1	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus, 
MAT.14.2	and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
MAT.14.3	For when Herod had John arrested, he bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. 
MAT.14.4	For John had been saying to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.” 
MAT.14.5	Although Herod wanted to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they regarded John as a prophet.
MAT.14.6	But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before 
MAT.14.7	so 
MAT.14.8	Having been prompted by her mother, she *said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.” 
MAT.14.9	Although he was grieved, the king commanded 
MAT.14.10	He sent and had John beheaded in the prison. 
MAT.14.11	And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. 
MAT.14.12	His disciples came and took away the body and buried it; and they went and reported to Jesus.
MAT.14.13	Now when Jesus heard 
MAT.14.14	When He went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and felt compassion for them and healed their sick.
MAT.14.15	When it was evening, the disciples came to Him and said, “This place is desolate and the hour is already late; so send the crowds away, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.” 
MAT.14.16	But Jesus said to them, 
MAT.14.17	They *said to Him, “We have here only five loaves and two fish.” 
MAT.14.18	And He said, 
MAT.14.19	Ordering the people to sit down on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed 
MAT.14.20	and they all ate and were satisfied. They picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve full baskets. 
MAT.14.21	There were about five thousand men who ate, besides women and children.
MAT.14.22	Immediately He made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away. 
MAT.14.23	After He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray; and when it was evening, He was there alone. 
MAT.14.24	But the boat was already 
MAT.14.25	And in the 
MAT.14.26	When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out in fear. 
MAT.14.27	But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, 
MAT.14.28	Peter said to Him, “Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.” 
MAT.14.29	And He said, 
MAT.14.30	But seeing the wind, he became frightened, and beginning to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!” 
MAT.14.31	Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him, and *said to him, 
MAT.14.32	When they got into the boat, the wind stopped. 
MAT.14.33	And those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, “You are certainly God’s Son!”
MAT.14.34	When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. 
MAT.14.35	And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent 
MAT.14.36	and they implored Him that they might just touch the fringe of His cloak; and as many as touched 
MAT.15.1	Then some Pharisees and scribes *came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said, 
MAT.15.2	“Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.” 
MAT.15.3	And He answered and said to them, 
MAT.15.10	After Jesus called the crowd to Him, He said to them, 
MAT.15.12	Then the disciples *came and *said to Him, “Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?” 
MAT.15.13	But He answered and said, 
MAT.15.15	Peter said to Him, “Explain the parable to us.” 
MAT.15.16	Jesus said, 
MAT.15.21	Jesus went away from there, and withdrew into the district of Tyre and Sidon. 
MAT.15.22	And a Canaanite woman from that region came out and 
MAT.15.23	But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, “Send her away, because she keeps shouting at us.” 
MAT.15.24	But He answered and said, 
MAT.15.25	But she came and 
MAT.15.26	And He answered and said, 
MAT.15.27	But she said, “Yes, Lord; but even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.” 
MAT.15.28	Then Jesus said to her, 
MAT.15.29	Departing from there, Jesus went along by the Sea of Galilee, and having gone up on the mountain, He was sitting there. 
MAT.15.30	And large crowds came to Him, bringing with them 
MAT.15.31	So the crowd marveled as they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.
MAT.15.32	And Jesus called His disciples to Him, and said, 
MAT.15.33	The disciples *said to Him, “Where would we get so many loaves in 
MAT.15.34	And Jesus *said to them, 
MAT.15.35	And He directed the people to sit down on the ground; 
MAT.15.36	and He took the seven loaves and the fish; and giving thanks, He broke them and started giving them to the disciples, and the disciples 
MAT.15.37	And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven large baskets full. 
MAT.15.38	And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
MAT.15.39	And sending away the crowds, Jesus got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
MAT.16.1	The Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and testing Jesus, they asked Him to show them a sign from heaven. 
MAT.16.2	But He replied to them, 
MAT.16.4	 And He left them and went away.
MAT.16.5	And the disciples came to the other side 
MAT.16.6	And Jesus said to them, 
MAT.16.7	They began to discuss 
MAT.16.8	But Jesus, aware of this, said, 
MAT.16.12	Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
MAT.16.13	Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, He was asking His disciples, 
MAT.16.14	And they said, “Some 
MAT.16.15	He *said to them, 
MAT.16.16	Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” 
MAT.16.17	And Jesus said to him, 
MAT.16.20	Then He warned the disciples that they should tell no one that He was the Christ.
MAT.16.21	From that time Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day. 
MAT.16.22	Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, “God forbid 
MAT.16.23	But He turned and said to Peter, 
MAT.16.24	Then Jesus said to His disciples, 
MAT.17.1	Six days later Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and *led them up on a high mountain by themselves. 
MAT.17.2	And He was transfigured before them; and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light. 
MAT.17.3	And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him. 
MAT.17.4	Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” 
MAT.17.5	While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud said, “This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased; listen to Him!” 
MAT.17.6	When the disciples heard 
MAT.17.7	And Jesus came to 
MAT.17.8	And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone.
MAT.17.9	As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, 
MAT.17.10	And His disciples asked Him, “Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” 
MAT.17.11	And He answered and said, 
MAT.17.13	Then the disciples understood that He had spoken to them about John the Baptist.
MAT.17.14	When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, falling on his knees before Him and saying, 
MAT.17.15	“Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic and is very ill; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water. 
MAT.17.16	I brought him to Your disciples, and they could not cure him.” 
MAT.17.17	And Jesus answered and said, 
MAT.17.18	And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was cured at once.
MAT.17.19	Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not drive it out?” 
MAT.17.20	And He *said to them, 
MAT.17.21	[
MAT.17.22	And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, 
MAT.17.23	 And they were deeply grieved.
MAT.17.24	When they came to Capernaum, those who collected the 
MAT.17.25	He *said, “Yes.” And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, 
MAT.17.26	When Peter said, “From strangers,” Jesus said to him, 
MAT.18.1	At that time the disciples came to Jesus and said, “Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” 
MAT.18.2	And He called a child to Himself and set him before them, 
MAT.18.3	and said, 
MAT.18.11	[
MAT.18.21	Then Peter came and said to Him, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?” 
MAT.18.22	Jesus *said to him, 
MAT.19.1	When Jesus had finished these words, He departed from Galilee and came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan; 
MAT.19.2	and large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.
MAT.19.4	And He answered and said, 
MAT.19.7	They *said to Him, “Why then did Moses command to 
MAT.19.8	He *said to them, 
MAT.19.10	The disciples *said to Him, “If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry.” 
MAT.19.11	But He said to them, 
MAT.19.13	Then 
MAT.19.14	But Jesus said, 
MAT.19.15	After laying His hands on them, He departed from there.
MAT.19.16	And someone came to Him and said, “Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may obtain eternal life?” 
MAT.19.17	And He said to him, 
MAT.19.18	 he *said to Him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, 
MAT.19.20	The young man *said to Him, “All these things I have kept; what am I still lacking?” 
MAT.19.21	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.19.22	But when the young man heard this statement, he went away grieving; for he was one who owned much property.
MAT.19.23	And Jesus said to His disciples, 
MAT.19.25	When the disciples heard 
MAT.19.26	And looking at 
MAT.19.27	Then Peter said to Him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed You; what then will there be for us?” 
MAT.19.28	And Jesus said to them, 
MAT.20.17	As Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve 
MAT.20.20	Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons, bowing down and making a request of Him. 
MAT.20.21	And He said to her, 
MAT.20.22	But Jesus answered, 
MAT.20.23	He *said to them, 
MAT.20.24	And hearing 
MAT.20.25	But Jesus called them to Himself and said, 
MAT.20.29	As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him. 
MAT.20.30	And two blind men sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 
MAT.20.31	The crowd sternly told them to be quiet, but they cried out all the more, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!” 
MAT.20.32	And Jesus stopped and called them, and said, 
MAT.20.33	They *said to Him, “Lord, 
MAT.20.34	Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him.
MAT.21.1	When they had approached Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, 
MAT.21.2	saying to them, 
MAT.21.4	This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:
MAT.21.5	“S
MAT.21.5	‘B
MAT.21.5	G
MAT.21.5	E
MAT.21.6	The disciples went and did just as Jesus had instructed them, 
MAT.21.7	and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their coats on them; and He sat on the coats. 
MAT.21.8	Most of the crowd spread their coats in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road. 
MAT.21.9	The crowds going ahead of Him, and those who followed, were shouting,
MAT.21.9	“Hosanna to the Son of David;
MAT.21.9	B
MAT.21.9	Hosanna in the highest!”
MAT.21.10	When He had entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, “Who is this?” 
MAT.21.11	And the crowds were saying, “This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee.”
MAT.21.12	And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves. 
MAT.21.13	And He *said to them, 
MAT.21.14	And 
MAT.21.15	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done, and the children who were shouting in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they became indignant 
MAT.21.16	and said to Him, “Do You hear what these 
MAT.21.17	And He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.
MAT.21.18	Now in the morning, when He was returning to the city, He became hungry. 
MAT.21.19	Seeing a lone fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only; and He *said to it, 
MAT.21.20	Seeing 
MAT.21.21	And Jesus answered and said to them, 
MAT.21.23	When He entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him while He was teaching, and said, “By what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?” 
MAT.21.24	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.25	 And they 
MAT.21.26	But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the people; for they all regard John as a prophet.” 
MAT.21.27	And answering Jesus, they said, “We do not know.” He also said to them, 
MAT.21.31	 They *said, “The first.” Jesus *said to them, 
MAT.21.41	They *said to Him, “He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and will rent out the vineyard to other vine-growers who will pay him the proceeds at the 
MAT.21.42	Jesus *said to them, 
MAT.21.45	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking about them. 
MAT.21.46	When they sought to seize Him, they feared the people, because they considered Him to be a prophet.
MAT.22.1	Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying, 
MAT.22.15	Then the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might trap Him in what He said. 
MAT.22.16	And they *sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any. 
MAT.22.17	Tell us then, what do You think? Is it lawful to give a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?” 
MAT.22.18	But Jesus perceived their malice, and said, 
MAT.22.19	 And they brought Him a denarius. 
MAT.22.20	And He *said to them, 
MAT.22.21	They *said to Him, “Caesar’s.” Then He *said to them, 
MAT.22.22	And hearing 
MAT.22.23	On that day 
MAT.22.24	asking, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘I

MAT.22.26	so also the second, and the third, down to the seventh. 
MAT.22.27	Last of all, the woman died. 
MAT.22.28	In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had 
MAT.22.29	But Jesus answered and said to them, 
MAT.22.33	When the crowds heard 
MAT.22.34	But when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered themselves together. 
MAT.22.35	One of them, 
MAT.22.36	“Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” 
MAT.22.37	And He said to him, 
MAT.22.41	Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question: 
MAT.22.42	 They *said to Him, “
MAT.22.43	He *said to them, 
MAT.22.46	No one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask Him another question.
MAT.23.1	Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples, 
MAT.23.2	saying: 
MAT.23.14	[
MAT.24.1	Jesus came out from the temple and was going away when His disciples came up to point out the temple buildings to Him. 
MAT.24.2	And He said to them, 
MAT.24.3	As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things happen, and what 
MAT.24.4	And Jesus answered and said to them, 
MAT.26.1	When Jesus had finished all these words, He said to His disciples, 
MAT.26.3	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, named Caiaphas; 
MAT.26.4	and they plotted together to seize Jesus by stealth and kill Him. 
MAT.26.5	But they were saying, “Not during the festival, otherwise a riot might occur among the people.”
MAT.26.6	Now when Jesus was in Bethany, at the home of Simon the leper, 
MAT.26.7	a woman came to Him with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume, and she poured it on His head as He reclined 
MAT.26.8	But the disciples were indignant when they saw 
MAT.26.9	For this 
MAT.26.10	But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, 
MAT.26.14	Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 
MAT.26.15	and said, “What are you willing to give me to betray Him to you?” And they weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him. 
MAT.26.16	From then on he 
MAT.26.17	Now on the first 
MAT.26.18	And He said, 
MAT.26.19	The disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.
MAT.26.20	Now when evening came, Jesus was reclining 
MAT.26.21	As they were eating, He said, 
MAT.26.22	Being deeply grieved, they each one began to say to Him, “Surely not I, Lord?” 
MAT.26.23	And He answered, 
MAT.26.25	And Judas, who was betraying Him, said, “Surely it is not I, Rabbi?” Jesus *said to him, 
MAT.26.26	While they were eating, Jesus took 
MAT.26.27	And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave 
MAT.26.30	After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
MAT.26.31	Then Jesus *said to them, 
MAT.26.33	But Peter said to Him, “
MAT.26.34	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.26.35	Peter *said to Him, “Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You.” All the disciples said the same thing too.
MAT.26.36	Then Jesus *came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and *said to His disciples, 
MAT.26.37	And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be grieved and distressed. 
MAT.26.38	Then He *said to them, 
MAT.26.39	And He went a little beyond 
MAT.26.40	And He *came to the disciples and *found them sleeping, and *said to Peter, 
MAT.26.42	He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, 
MAT.26.43	Again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 
MAT.26.44	And He left them again, and went away and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more. 
MAT.26.45	Then He *came to the disciples and *said to them, 
MAT.26.47	While He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came up accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs, 
MAT.26.48	Now he who was betraying Him gave them a sign, saying, “Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him.” 
MAT.26.49	Immediately Judas went to Jesus and said, “Hail, Rabbi!” and kissed Him. 
MAT.26.50	And Jesus said to him, 
MAT.26.51	And behold, one of those who were with Jesus reached and drew out his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear. 
MAT.26.52	Then Jesus *said to him, 
MAT.26.55	At that time Jesus said to the crowds, 
MAT.26.56	 Then all the disciples left Him and fled.
MAT.26.57	Those who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. 
MAT.26.58	But Peter was following Him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and entered in, and sat down with the officers to see the outcome.
MAT.26.59	Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death. 
MAT.26.60	They did not find 
MAT.26.61	and said, “This man stated, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.’ ” 
MAT.26.62	The high priest stood up and said to Him, “Do You not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?” 
MAT.26.63	But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him, “I adjure You by the living God, that You tell us whether You are the Christ, the Son of God.” 
MAT.26.64	Jesus *said to him, 
MAT.26.65	Then the high priest tore his robes and said, “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have now heard the blasphemy; 
MAT.26.66	what do you think?” They answered, “He deserves death!”
MAT.26.67	Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists; and others slapped Him, 
MAT.26.68	and said, “Prophesy to us, You Christ; who is the one who hit You?”
MAT.26.69	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came to him and said, “You too were with Jesus the Galilean.” 
MAT.26.70	But he denied 
MAT.26.71	When he had gone out to the gateway, another 
MAT.26.72	And again he denied 
MAT.26.73	A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Surely you too are 
MAT.26.74	Then he began to curse and swear, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed. 
MAT.26.75	And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, 
MAT.27.1	Now when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against Jesus to put Him to death; 
MAT.27.2	and they bound Him, and led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate the governor.
MAT.27.3	Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, 
MAT.27.4	saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” But they said, “What is that to us? See 
MAT.27.5	And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple sanctuary and departed; and he went away and hanged himself. 
MAT.27.6	The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, “It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is the price of blood.” 
MAT.27.7	And they conferred together and with the money bought the Potter’s Field as a burial place for strangers. 
MAT.27.8	For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. 
MAT.27.9	Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “A
MAT.27.10	 P
MAT.27.11	Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, “Are You the King of the Jews?” And Jesus said to him, 
MAT.27.12	And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He did not answer. 
MAT.27.13	Then Pilate *said to Him, “Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?” 
MAT.27.14	And He did not answer him with regard to even a 
MAT.27.15	Now at 
MAT.27.16	At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. 
MAT.27.17	So when the people gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” 
MAT.27.18	For he knew that because of envy they had handed Him over.
MAT.27.19	While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him 
MAT.27.20	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to put Jesus to death. 
MAT.27.21	But the governor said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas.” 
MAT.27.22	Pilate *said to them, “Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” They all *said, “Crucify Him!” 
MAT.27.23	And he said, “Why, what evil has He done?” But they kept shouting all the more, saying, “Crucify Him!”
MAT.27.24	When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this Man’s blood; see 
MAT.27.25	And all the people said, “His blood shall be on us and on our children!” 
MAT.27.26	Then he released Barabbas for them; but after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified.
MAT.27.27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole 
MAT.27.28	They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him. 
MAT.27.29	And after twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand; and they knelt down before Him and mocked Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
MAT.27.30	They spat on Him, and took the reed and 
MAT.27.31	After they had mocked Him, they took the 
MAT.27.32	As they were coming out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, whom they pressed into service to bear His cross.
MAT.27.33	And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull, 
MAT.27.34	they gave Him wine to drink mixed with gall; and after tasting 
MAT.27.35	And when they had crucified Him, they divided up His garments among themselves by casting lots. 
MAT.27.36	And sitting down, they 
MAT.27.37	And above His head they put up the charge against Him which read, “THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
MAT.27.38	At that time two robbers *were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left. 
MAT.27.39	And those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads 
MAT.27.40	and saying, “You who 
MAT.27.41	In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking 
MAT.27.42	“He saved others; He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel; let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in Him. 
MAT.27.43	H
MAT.27.44	The robbers who had been crucified with Him were also insulting Him with the same words.
MAT.27.45	Now from the 
MAT.27.46	About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, 
MAT.27.47	And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, 
MAT.27.48	Immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink. 
MAT.27.49	But the rest 
MAT.27.50	And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit. 
MAT.27.51	And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks were split. 
MAT.27.52	The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; 
MAT.27.53	and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many. 
MAT.27.54	Now the centurion, and those who were with him keeping guard over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, became very frightened and said, “Truly this was the Son of God!”
MAT.27.55	Many women were there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee while ministering to Him. 
MAT.27.56	Among them was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
MAT.27.57	When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus. 
MAT.27.58	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given 
MAT.27.59	And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 
MAT.27.60	and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away. 
MAT.27.61	And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.
MAT.27.62	Now on the next day, the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate, 
MAT.27.63	and said, “Sir, we remember that when He was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I 
MAT.27.64	Therefore, give orders for the grave to be made secure until the third day, otherwise His disciples may come and steal Him away and say to the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.” 
MAT.27.65	Pilate said to them, “You have a guard; go, make it 
MAT.27.66	And they went and made the grave secure, and along with the guard they set a seal on the stone.
MAT.28.1	Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first 
MAT.28.2	And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it. 
MAT.28.3	And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. 
MAT.28.4	The guards shook for fear of him and became like dead men. 
MAT.28.5	The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified. 
MAT.28.6	He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying. 
MAT.28.7	Go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; and behold, He is going ahead of you into Galilee, there you will see Him; behold, I have told you.”
MAT.28.8	And they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to report it to His disciples. 
MAT.28.9	And behold, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him. 
MAT.28.10	Then Jesus *said to them, 
MAT.28.11	Now while they were on their way, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened. 
MAT.28.12	And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 
MAT.28.13	and said, “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’ 
MAT.28.14	And if this should come to the governor’s ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble.” 
MAT.28.15	And they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews, 
MAT.28.16	But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated. 
MAT.28.17	When they saw Him, they worshiped 
MAT.28.18	And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, 
MRK.1.1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
MRK.1.2	As it is written in Isaiah the prophet:
MRK.1.2	“B

MRK.1.3	M
MRK.1.4	John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness 
MRK.1.5	And all the country of Judea was going out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. 
MRK.1.6	John was clothed with camel’s hair and 
MRK.1.7	And he was preaching, and saying, “After me One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to stoop down and untie the thong of His sandals. 
MRK.1.8	I baptized you 
MRK.1.9	In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 
MRK.1.10	Immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opening, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him; 
MRK.1.11	and a voice came out of the heavens: “You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased.”
MRK.1.12	Immediately the Spirit *impelled Him 
MRK.1.13	And He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to Him.
MRK.1.14	Now after John had been taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, 
MRK.1.15	and saying, 
MRK.1.16	As He was going along by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen. 
MRK.1.17	And Jesus said to them, 
MRK.1.18	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him. 
MRK.1.19	Going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets. 
MRK.1.20	Immediately He called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went away to follow Him.
MRK.1.21	They *went into Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and 
MRK.1.22	They were amazed at His teaching; for He was teaching them as 
MRK.1.23	Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 
MRK.1.24	saying, “What business do we have with each other, Jesus 
MRK.1.25	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, 
MRK.1.26	Throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him. 
MRK.1.27	They were all amazed, so that they debated among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.” 
MRK.1.28	Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere into all the surrounding district of Galilee.
MRK.1.29	And immediately after they came out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
MRK.1.30	Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever; and immediately they *spoke to Jesus about her. 
MRK.1.31	And He came to her and raised her up, taking her by the hand, and the fever left her, and she 
MRK.1.32	When evening came, after the sun had set, they 
MRK.1.33	And the whole city had gathered at the door. 
MRK.1.34	And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He was not permitting the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.
MRK.1.35	In the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left 
MRK.1.36	Simon and his companions searched for Him; 
MRK.1.37	they found Him, and *said to Him, “Everyone is looking for You.” 
MRK.1.38	He *said to them, 
MRK.1.39	And He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out the demons.
MRK.1.40	And a leper *came to Jesus, beseeching Him and falling on his knees before Him, and saying, “If You are willing, You can make me clean.” 
MRK.1.41	Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, and *said to him, 
MRK.1.42	Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed. 
MRK.1.43	And He sternly warned him and immediately sent him away, 
MRK.1.44	and He *said to him, 
MRK.1.45	But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news around, to such an extent that Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city, but 
MRK.2.1	When He had come back to Capernaum several days afterward, it was heard that He was at home. 
MRK.2.2	And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room, not even near the door; and He was speaking the word to them. 
MRK.2.3	And they *came, bringing to Him a paralytic, carried by four men. 
MRK.2.4	Being unable to get to Him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above Him; and when they had dug an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying. 
MRK.2.5	And Jesus seeing their faith *said to the paralytic, 
MRK.2.6	But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 
MRK.2.7	“Why does this man speak that way? He is blaspheming; who can forgive sins but God alone?” 
MRK.2.8	Immediately Jesus, aware in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves, *said to them, 
MRK.2.10	—He *said to the paralytic, 
MRK.2.12	And he got up and immediately picked up the pallet and went out in the sight of everyone, so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this.”
MRK.2.13	And He went out again by the seashore; and all the people were coming to Him, and He was teaching them.
MRK.2.14	As He passed by, He saw Levi the 
MRK.2.15	And it *happened that He was reclining 
MRK.2.16	When the scribes of the Pharisees saw that He was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they said to His disciples, “Why is He eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners?” 
MRK.2.17	And hearing 
MRK.2.18	John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and they *came and *said to Him, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?” 
MRK.2.19	And Jesus said to them, 
MRK.2.23	And it happened that He was passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way along while picking the heads 
MRK.2.24	The Pharisees were saying to Him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?” 
MRK.2.25	And He *said to them, 
MRK.2.27	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.3.1	He entered again into a synagogue; and a man was there whose hand was withered. 
MRK.3.2	They were watching Him 
MRK.3.3	He *said to the man with the withered hand, 
MRK.3.4	And He *said to them, 
MRK.3.5	After looking around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, He *said to the man, 
MRK.3.6	The Pharisees went out and immediately 
MRK.3.7	Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples; and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and 
MRK.3.8	and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon, a great number of people heard of all that He was doing and came to Him. 
MRK.3.9	And He told His disciples that a boat should stand ready for Him because of the crowd, so that they would not crowd Him; 
MRK.3.10	for He had healed many, with the result that all those who had afflictions pressed around Him in order to touch Him. 
MRK.3.11	Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they would fall down before Him and shout, “You are the Son of God!” 
MRK.3.12	And He earnestly warned them not to tell who He was.
MRK.3.13	And He *went up on the mountain and *summoned those whom He Himself wanted, and they came to Him. 
MRK.3.14	And He appointed twelve, so that they would be with Him and that He 
MRK.3.15	and to have authority to cast out the demons. 
MRK.3.16	And He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter), 
MRK.3.17	and James, the 
MRK.3.18	and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot; 
MRK.3.19	and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him.
MRK.3.20	And He *came 
MRK.3.21	When His own 
MRK.3.22	The scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and “He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons.” 
MRK.3.23	And He called them to Himself and began speaking to them in parables, 
MRK.3.29	— 
MRK.3.30	because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”
MRK.3.31	Then His mother and His brothers *arrived, and standing outside they sent 
MRK.3.32	A crowd was sitting around Him, and they *said to Him, “Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You.” 
MRK.3.33	Answering them, He *said, 
MRK.3.34	Looking about at those who were sitting around Him, He *said, 
MRK.4.1	He began to teach again by the sea. And such a very large crowd gathered to Him that He got into a boat in the sea and sat down; and the whole crowd was by the sea on the land. 
MRK.4.2	And He was teaching them many things in parables, and was saying to them in His teaching, 
MRK.4.9	And He was saying, 
MRK.4.10	As soon as He was alone, His followers, along with the twelve, 
MRK.4.11	And He was saying to them, 
MRK.4.13	And He *said to them, 
MRK.4.21	And He was saying to them, 
MRK.4.24	And He was saying to them, 
MRK.4.26	And He was saying, 
MRK.4.30	And He said, 
MRK.4.33	With many such parables He was speaking the word to them, so far as they were able to hear it; 
MRK.4.34	and He did not speak to them without a parable; but He was explaining everything privately to His own disciples.
MRK.4.35	On that day, when evening came, He *said to them, 
MRK.4.36	Leaving the crowd, they *took Him along with them in the boat, just as He was; and other boats were with Him. 
MRK.4.37	And there *arose a fierce gale of wind, and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling up. 
MRK.4.38	Jesus Himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they *woke Him and *said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?” 
MRK.4.39	And He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, 
MRK.4.40	And He said to them, 
MRK.4.41	They became very much afraid and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”
MRK.5.1	They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes. 
MRK.5.2	When He got out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him, 
MRK.5.3	and he had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him anymore, even with a chain; 
MRK.5.4	because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles broken in pieces, and no one was strong enough to subdue him. 
MRK.5.5	Constantly, night and day, he was screaming among the tombs and in the mountains, and gashing himself with stones. 
MRK.5.6	Seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran up and bowed down before Him; 
MRK.5.7	and shouting with a loud voice, he *said, “What business do we have with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore You by God, do not torment me!” 
MRK.5.8	For He had been saying to him, 
MRK.5.9	And He was asking him, 
MRK.5.10	And he 
MRK.5.11	Now there was a large herd of swine feeding nearby on the mountain. 
MRK.5.12	 implored Him, saying, “Send us into the swine so that we may enter them.” 
MRK.5.13	Jesus gave them permission. And coming out, the unclean spirits entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, about two thousand 
MRK.5.14	Their herdsmen ran away and reported it in the city and in the country. And 
MRK.5.15	They *came to Jesus and *observed the man who had been demon-possessed sitting down, clothed and in his right mind, the very man who had had the “legion”; and they became frightened. 
MRK.5.16	Those who had seen it described to them how it had happened to the demon-possessed man, and 
MRK.5.17	And they began to implore Him to leave their region. 
MRK.5.18	As He was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed was imploring Him that he might accompany Him. 
MRK.5.19	And He did not let him, but He *said to him, 
MRK.5.20	And he went away and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.
MRK.5.21	When Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him; and so He stayed by the seashore. 
MRK.5.22	One of the synagogue officials named Jairus *came up, and on seeing Him, *fell at His feet 
MRK.5.23	and *implored Him earnestly, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death; 
MRK.5.24	And He went off with him; and a large crowd was following Him and pressing in on Him.
MRK.5.25	A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years, 
MRK.5.26	and had endured much at the hands of many physicians, and had spent all that she had and was not helped at all, but rather had grown worse— 
MRK.5.27	after hearing about Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind 
MRK.5.28	For she thought, “If I just touch His garments, I will get well.” 
MRK.5.29	Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction. 
MRK.5.30	Immediately Jesus, perceiving in Himself that the power 
MRK.5.31	And His disciples said to Him, “You see the crowd pressing in on You, and You say, ‘Who touched Me?’ ” 
MRK.5.32	And He looked around to see the woman who had done this. 
MRK.5.33	But the woman fearing and trembling, aware of what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth. 
MRK.5.34	And He said to her, 
MRK.5.35	While He was still speaking, they *came from the 
MRK.5.36	But Jesus, overhearing what was being spoken, *said to the synagogue official, 
MRK.5.37	And He allowed no one to accompany Him, except Peter and James and John the brother of James. 
MRK.5.38	They *came to the house of the synagogue official; and He *saw a commotion, and 
MRK.5.39	And entering in, He *said to them, 
MRK.5.40	They 
MRK.5.41	Taking the child by the hand, He *said to her, 
MRK.5.42	Immediately the girl got up and 
MRK.5.43	And He gave them strict orders that no one should know about this, and He said that 
MRK.6.1	Jesus went out from there and *came into His hometown; and His disciples *followed Him. 
MRK.6.2	When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue; and the many listeners were astonished, saying, “Where did this man 
MRK.6.3	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are not His sisters here with us?” And they took offense at Him. 
MRK.6.4	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.6.5	And He could do no miracle there except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them. 
MRK.6.6	And He wondered at their unbelief.
MRK.6.7	And He *summoned the twelve and began to send them out in pairs, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits; 
MRK.6.8	and He instructed them that they should take nothing for 
MRK.6.9	but 
MRK.6.10	And He said to them, 
MRK.6.12	They went out and preached that 
MRK.6.13	And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with oil many sick people and healing them.
MRK.6.14	And King Herod heard 
MRK.6.15	But others were saying, “He is Elijah.” And others were saying, “
MRK.6.16	But when Herod heard 
MRK.6.17	For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested and bound in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because he had married her. 
MRK.6.18	For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” 
MRK.6.19	Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death and could not 
MRK.6.20	for Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was very perplexed; but he used to enjoy listening to him. 
MRK.6.21	A strategic day came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his lords and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee; 
MRK.6.22	and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests; and the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you.” 
MRK.6.23	And he swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you; up to half of my kingdom.” 
MRK.6.24	And she went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?” And she said, “The head of John the Baptist.” 
MRK.6.25	Immediately she came in a hurry to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.” 
MRK.6.26	And although the king was very sorry, 
MRK.6.27	Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded 
MRK.6.28	and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	When his disciples heard 
MRK.6.30	The apostles *gathered together with Jesus; and they reported to Him all that they had done and taught. 
MRK.6.31	And He *said to them, 
MRK.6.32	They went away in the boat to a secluded place by themselves.
MRK.6.34	When Jesus went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and He felt compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and He began to teach them many things. 
MRK.6.35	When it was already quite late, His disciples came to Him and said, “This place is desolate and it is already quite late; 
MRK.6.36	send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.” 
MRK.6.37	But He answered them, 
MRK.6.38	And He *said to them, 
MRK.6.39	And He commanded them all to sit down by groups on the green grass. 
MRK.6.40	They sat down in groups of hundreds and of fifties. 
MRK.6.41	And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed 
MRK.6.42	They all ate and were satisfied, 
MRK.6.43	and they picked up twelve full baskets of the broken pieces, and also of the fish. 
MRK.6.44	There were five thousand men who ate the loaves.
MRK.6.45	Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go ahead of 
MRK.6.46	After bidding them farewell, He left for the mountain to pray.
MRK.6.47	When it was evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land. 
MRK.6.48	Seeing them straining at the oars, for the wind was against them, at about the fourth watch of the night He *came to them, walking on the sea; and He intended to pass by them. 
MRK.6.49	But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out; 
MRK.6.50	for they all saw Him and were terrified. But immediately He spoke with them and *said to them, 
MRK.6.51	Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped; and they were utterly astonished, 
MRK.6.52	for they had not gained any insight from the 
MRK.6.53	When they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore. 
MRK.6.54	When they got out of the boat, immediately 
MRK.6.55	and ran about that whole country and began to carry here and there on their pallets those who were sick, to the place they heard He was. 
MRK.6.56	Wherever He entered villages, or cities, or countryside, they were laying the sick in the market places, and imploring Him that they might just touch the fringe of His cloak; and as many as touched it were being cured.
MRK.7.1	The Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered around Him when they had come from Jerusalem, 
MRK.7.2	and had seen that some of His disciples were eating their bread with impure hands, that is, unwashed. 
MRK.7.3	(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they carefully wash their hands, 
MRK.7.4	and 
MRK.7.5	The Pharisees and the scribes *asked Him, “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with impure hands?” 
MRK.7.6	And He said to them, 
MRK.7.9	He was also saying to them, 
MRK.7.11	 (that is to say, 
MRK.7.14	After He called the crowd to Him again, He 
MRK.7.16	[
MRK.7.17	When he had left the crowd 
MRK.7.18	And He *said to them, 
MRK.7.19	 (
MRK.7.20	And He was saying, 
MRK.7.24	Jesus got up and went away from there to the region of Tyre
MRK.7.25	But after hearing of Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately came and fell at His feet. 
MRK.7.26	Now the woman was a 
MRK.7.27	And He was saying to her, 
MRK.7.28	But she answered and *said to Him, “Yes, Lord, 
MRK.7.29	And He said to her, 
MRK.7.30	And going back to her home, she found the child lying on the bed, the demon having left.
MRK.7.31	Again He went out from the region of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of Decapolis. 
MRK.7.32	They *brought to Him one who was deaf and spoke with difficulty, and they *implored Him to lay His hand on him. 
MRK.7.33	Jesus took him aside from the crowd, by himself, and put His fingers into his ears, and after spitting, He touched his tongue 
MRK.7.34	and looking up to heaven with a deep sigh, He *said to him, 
MRK.7.35	And his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was removed, and he 
MRK.7.36	And He gave them orders not to tell anyone; but the more He ordered them, the more widely they continued to proclaim it. 
MRK.7.37	They were utterly astonished, saying, “He has done all things well; He makes even the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.”
MRK.8.1	In those days, when there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples and *said to them, 
MRK.8.4	And His disciples answered Him, “Where will anyone be able 
MRK.8.5	And He was asking them, 
MRK.8.6	And He *directed the people to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks and broke them, and started giving them to His disciples to serve to them, and they served them to the people. 
MRK.8.7	They also had a few small fish; and after He had blessed them, He ordered these to be served as well. 
MRK.8.8	And they ate and were satisfied; and they picked up seven large baskets full of what was left over of the broken pieces. 
MRK.8.9	About four thousand were 
MRK.8.10	And immediately He entered the boat with His disciples and came to the district of Dalmanutha.
MRK.8.11	The Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, to test Him. 
MRK.8.12	Sighing deeply in His spirit, He *said, 
MRK.8.13	Leaving them, He again embarked and went away to the other side.
MRK.8.14	And they had forgotten to take bread, and did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them. 
MRK.8.15	And He was giving orders to them, saying, 
MRK.8.16	They 
MRK.8.17	And Jesus, aware of this, *said to them, 
MRK.8.19	 They *said to Him, “Twelve.” 
MRK.8.20	 And they *said to Him, “Seven.” 
MRK.8.21	And He was saying to them, 
MRK.8.22	And they *came to Bethsaida. And they *brought a blind man to Jesus and *implored Him to touch him. 
MRK.8.23	Taking the blind man by the hand, He brought him out of the village; and after spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him, He asked him, 
MRK.8.24	And he looked up and said, “I see men, for I see 
MRK.8.25	Then again He laid His hands on his eyes; and he looked intently and was restored, and 
MRK.8.26	And He sent him to his home, saying, 
MRK.8.27	Jesus went out, along with His disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, 
MRK.8.28	They told Him, saying, “John the Baptist; and others 
MRK.8.29	And He 
MRK.8.30	And He warned them to tell no one about Him.
MRK.8.31	And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. 
MRK.8.32	And He was stating the matter plainly. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. 
MRK.8.33	But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter and *said, 
MRK.8.34	And He summoned the crowd with His disciples, and said to them, 
MRK.9.1	And Jesus was saying to them, 
MRK.9.2	Six days later, Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John, and *brought them up on a high mountain by themselves. And He was transfigured before them; 
MRK.9.3	and His garments became radiant and exceedingly white, as no launderer on earth can whiten them. 
MRK.9.4	Elijah appeared to them along with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus. 
MRK.9.5	Peter *said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” 
MRK.9.6	For he did not know what to answer; for they became terrified. 
MRK.9.7	Then a cloud formed, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is My beloved Son, listen to Him!” 
MRK.9.8	All at once they looked around and saw no one with them anymore, except Jesus alone.
MRK.9.9	As they were coming down from the mountain, He gave them orders not to relate to anyone what they had seen, until the Son of Man rose from the dead. 
MRK.9.10	They seized upon that statement, discussing with one another what rising from the dead meant. 
MRK.9.11	They asked Him, saying, “
MRK.9.12	And He said to them, 
MRK.9.14	When they came 
MRK.9.15	Immediately, when the entire crowd saw Him, they were amazed and 
MRK.9.16	And He asked them, 
MRK.9.17	And one of the crowd answered Him, “Teacher, I brought You my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him mute; 
MRK.9.18	and whenever it seizes him, it slams him 
MRK.9.19	And He *answered them and *said, 
MRK.9.20	They brought the boy to Him. When he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he 
MRK.9.21	And He asked his father, 
MRK.9.22	It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!” 
MRK.9.23	And Jesus said to him, 
MRK.9.24	Immediately the boy’s father cried out and said, “I do believe; help my unbelief.” 
MRK.9.25	When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, 
MRK.9.26	After crying out and throwing him into terrible convulsions, it came out; and 
MRK.9.27	But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him; and he got up. 
MRK.9.28	When He came into 
MRK.9.29	And He said to them, 
MRK.9.30	From there they went out and 
MRK.9.31	For He was teaching His disciples and telling them, 
MRK.9.32	But they did not understand 
MRK.9.33	They came to Capernaum; and when He was in the house, He 
MRK.9.34	But they kept silent, for on the way they had discussed with one another which 
MRK.9.35	Sitting down, He called the twelve and *said to them, 
MRK.9.36	Taking a child, He set him before them, and taking him in His arms, He said to them, 
MRK.9.38	John said to Him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us.” 
MRK.9.39	But Jesus said, 
MRK.9.44	[
MRK.9.46	[
MRK.10.1	Getting up, He *went from there to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan; crowds *gathered around Him again, and, according to His custom, He once more 
MRK.10.3	And He answered and said to them, 
MRK.10.4	They said, “Moses permitted 
MRK.10.5	But Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.10	In the house the disciples 
MRK.10.11	And He *said to them, 
MRK.10.13	And they were bringing children to Him so that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked them. 
MRK.10.14	But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and said to them, 
MRK.10.16	And He took them in His arms and 
MRK.10.17	As He was setting out on a journey, a man ran up to Him and knelt before Him, and asked Him, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” 
MRK.10.18	And Jesus said to him, 
MRK.10.20	And he said to Him, “Teacher, I have kept all these things from my youth up.” 
MRK.10.21	Looking at him, Jesus felt a love for him and said to him, 
MRK.10.22	But at these words he was saddened, and he went away grieving, for he was one who owned much property.
MRK.10.23	And Jesus, looking around, *said to His disciples, 
MRK.10.24	The disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus *answered again and *said to them, 
MRK.10.26	They were even more astonished and said to Him, “Then who can be saved?” 
MRK.10.27	Looking at them, Jesus *said, 
MRK.10.28	Peter began to say to Him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed You.” 
MRK.10.29	Jesus said, 
MRK.10.32	They were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking on ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were fearful. And again He took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him, 
MRK.10.35	James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, *came up to Jesus, saying, “Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You.” 
MRK.10.36	And He said to them, 
MRK.10.37	They said to Him, “Grant that we may sit, one on Your right and one on 
MRK.10.38	But Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.39	They said to Him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.41	Hearing 
MRK.10.42	Calling them to Himself, Jesus *said to them, 
MRK.10.46	Then they *came to Jericho. And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd, a blind beggar 
MRK.10.47	When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 
MRK.10.48	Many were sternly telling him to be quiet, but he kept crying out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 
MRK.10.49	And Jesus stopped and said, 
MRK.10.50	Throwing aside his cloak, he jumped up and came to Jesus. 
MRK.10.51	And answering him, Jesus said, 
MRK.10.52	And Jesus said to him, 
MRK.11.1	As they *approached Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, He *sent two of His disciples, 
MRK.11.2	and *said to them, 
MRK.11.4	They went away and found a colt tied at the door, outside in the street; and they *untied it. 
MRK.11.5	Some of the bystanders were saying to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” 
MRK.11.6	They spoke to them just as Jesus had told 
MRK.11.7	They *brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it; and He sat on it. 
MRK.11.8	And many spread their coats in the road, and others 
MRK.11.9	Those who went in front and those who followed were shouting:
MRK.11.9	“Hosanna!
MRK.11.9	B
MRK.11.10	Blessed 
MRK.11.10	Hosanna in the highest!”
MRK.11.11	Jesus entered Jerusalem 
MRK.11.12	On the next day, when they had left Bethany, He became hungry. 
MRK.11.13	Seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf, He went 
MRK.11.14	He said to it, 
MRK.11.15	Then they *came to Jerusalem. And He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves; 
MRK.11.16	and He would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple. 
MRK.11.17	And He 
MRK.11.18	The chief priests and the scribes heard 
MRK.11.19	When evening came, they would go out of the city.
MRK.11.20	As they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots 
MRK.11.21	Being reminded, Peter *said to Him, “Rabbi, look, the fig tree which You cursed has withered.” 
MRK.11.22	And Jesus *answered saying to them, 
MRK.11.26	[
MRK.11.27	They *came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders *came to Him, 
MRK.11.28	and 
MRK.11.29	And Jesus said to them, 
MRK.11.31	They 
MRK.11.32	But shall we say, ‘From men’?”—they were afraid of the people, for everyone considered John to have been a real prophet. 
MRK.11.33	Answering Jesus, they *said, “We do not know.” And Jesus *said to them, 
MRK.12.1	And He began to speak to them in parables: 
MRK.12.12	And they were seeking to seize Him, and 
MRK.12.13	Then they *sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Him in order to trap Him in a statement. 
MRK.12.14	They *came and *said to Him, “Teacher, we know that You are truthful and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not? 
MRK.12.15	Shall we pay or shall we not pay?” But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, 
MRK.12.16	They brought 
MRK.12.17	And Jesus said to them, 
MRK.12.19	“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that 
MRK.12.20	There were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died leaving no children. 
MRK.12.21	The second one married her, and died leaving behind no children; and the third likewise; 
MRK.12.22	and 
MRK.12.23	In the resurrection, 
MRK.12.24	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.12.28	One of the scribes came and heard them arguing, and recognizing that He had answered them well, asked Him, “What commandment is the foremost of all?” 
MRK.12.29	Jesus answered, 
MRK.12.32	The scribe said to Him, “Right, Teacher; You have truly stated that H
MRK.12.33	 H
MRK.12.34	When Jesus saw that he had answered intelligently, He said to him, 
MRK.12.35	And Jesus 
MRK.12.38	In His teaching He was saying: 
MRK.12.41	And He sat down opposite the treasury, and 
MRK.12.42	A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which amount to a cent. 
MRK.12.43	Calling His disciples to Him, He said to them, 
MRK.13.1	As He was going out of the temple, one of His disciples *said to Him, “Teacher, behold 
MRK.13.2	And Jesus said to him, 
MRK.13.3	As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew were questioning Him privately, 
MRK.13.4	“Tell us, when will these things be, and what 
MRK.13.5	And Jesus began to say to them, 
MRK.14.1	Now the Passover and Unleavened Bread were two days away; and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to seize Him by stealth and kill 
MRK.14.2	for they were saying, “Not during the festival, otherwise there might be a riot of the people.”
MRK.14.3	While He was in Bethany at the home of Simon the leper, and reclining 
MRK.14.4	But some were indignantly 
MRK.14.5	For this perfume might have been sold for over three hundred 
MRK.14.6	But Jesus said, 
MRK.14.10	Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests in order to betray Him to them. 
MRK.14.11	They were glad when they heard 
MRK.14.12	On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover 
MRK.14.13	And He *sent two of His disciples and *said to them, 
MRK.14.16	The disciples went out and came to the city, and found 
MRK.14.17	When it was evening He *came with the twelve. 
MRK.14.18	As they were reclining 
MRK.14.19	They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one, “Surely not I?” 
MRK.14.20	And He said to them, 
MRK.14.22	While they were eating, He took 
MRK.14.23	And when He had taken a cup 
MRK.14.24	And He said to them, 
MRK.14.26	After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
MRK.14.27	And Jesus *said to them, 
MRK.14.29	But Peter said to Him, “
MRK.14.30	And Jesus *said to him, 
MRK.14.31	But 
MRK.14.32	They *came to a place named Gethsemane; and He *said to His disciples, 
MRK.14.33	And He *took with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be very distressed and troubled. 
MRK.14.34	And He *said to them, 
MRK.14.35	And He went a little beyond 
MRK.14.36	And He was saying, 
MRK.14.37	And He *came and *found them sleeping, and *said to Peter, 
MRK.14.39	Again He went away and prayed, saying the same words. 
MRK.14.40	And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer Him. 
MRK.14.41	And He *came the third time, and *said to them, 
MRK.14.43	Immediately while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, *came up accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs, 
MRK.14.44	Now he who was betraying Him had given them a signal, saying, “Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him and lead Him away under guard.” 
MRK.14.45	After coming, Judas immediately went to Him, saying, “Rabbi!” and kissed Him. 
MRK.14.46	They laid hands on Him and seized Him. 
MRK.14.47	But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear. 
MRK.14.48	And Jesus said to them, 
MRK.14.50	And they all left Him and fled.
MRK.14.51	A young man was following Him, wearing 
MRK.14.52	But he pulled free of the linen sheet and escaped naked.
MRK.14.53	They led Jesus away to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes *gathered together. 
MRK.14.54	Peter had followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself at the fire. 
MRK.14.55	Now the chief priests and the whole 
MRK.14.56	For many were giving false testimony against Him, but their testimony was not consistent. 
MRK.14.57	Some stood up and 
MRK.14.58	“We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.’ ” 
MRK.14.59	Not even in this respect was their testimony consistent. 
MRK.14.60	The high priest stood up 
MRK.14.61	But He kept silent and did not answer. Again the high priest was questioning Him, and saying to Him, “Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed 
MRK.14.62	And Jesus said, 
MRK.14.63	Tearing his clothes, the high priest *said, “What further need do we have of witnesses? 
MRK.14.64	You have heard the blasphemy; how does it seem to you?” And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death. 
MRK.14.65	Some began to spit at Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with their fists, and to say to Him, “Prophesy!” And the officers received Him with slaps 
MRK.14.66	As Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls of the high priest *came, 
MRK.14.67	and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and *said, “You also were with Jesus the Nazarene.” 
MRK.14.68	But he denied 
MRK.14.69	The servant-girl saw him, and began once more to say to the bystanders, “This is 
MRK.14.70	But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders were again saying to Peter, “Surely you are

MRK.14.72	Immediately a rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had made the remark to him, 
MRK.15.1	Early in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole 
MRK.15.2	Pilate questioned Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” And He *answered him, 
MRK.15.3	The chief priests 
MRK.15.4	Then Pilate questioned Him again, saying, “Do You not answer? See how many charges they bring against You!” 
MRK.15.5	But Jesus made no further answer; so Pilate was amazed.
MRK.15.6	Now at 
MRK.15.7	The man named Barabbas had been imprisoned with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the insurrection. 
MRK.15.8	The crowd went up and began asking him 
MRK.15.9	Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?” 
MRK.15.10	For he was aware that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy. 
MRK.15.11	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd 
MRK.15.12	Answering again, Pilate said to them, “Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?” 
MRK.15.13	They shouted back, “Crucify Him!” 
MRK.15.14	But Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has He done?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify Him!” 
MRK.15.15	Wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them, and after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified.
MRK.15.16	The soldiers took Him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium), and they *called together the whole 
MRK.15.17	They *dressed Him up in purple, and after twisting a crown of thorns, they put it on Him; 
MRK.15.18	and they began to acclaim Him, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
MRK.15.19	They kept beating His head with a 
MRK.15.20	After they had mocked Him, they took the purple robe off Him and put His 
MRK.15.21	They *pressed into service a passer-by coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), to bear His cross.
MRK.15.22	Then they *brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull. 
MRK.15.23	They tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He did not take it. 
MRK.15.24	And they *crucified Him, and *divided up His garments among themselves, casting lots for them 
MRK.15.25	It was the 
MRK.15.26	The inscription of the charge against Him read, “THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
MRK.15.27	They *crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and one on His left. 
MRK.15.28	[
MRK.15.29	Those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who 
MRK.15.30	save Yourself, and come down from the cross!” 
MRK.15.31	In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes, were mocking 
MRK.15.32	Let 
MRK.15.33	When the 
MRK.15.34	At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, 
MRK.15.35	When some of the bystanders heard it, they 
MRK.15.36	Someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink, saying, “Let us see whether Elijah will come to take Him down.” 
MRK.15.37	And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed His last. 
MRK.15.38	And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 
MRK.15.39	When the centurion, who was standing right in front of Him, saw the way He breathed His last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”
MRK.15.40	There were also 
MRK.15.41	When He was in Galilee, they used to follow Him and minister to Him; and 
MRK.15.42	When evening had already come, because it was the preparation day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 
MRK.15.43	Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent member of the Council, who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God; and he gathered up courage and went in before Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. 
MRK.15.44	Pilate wondered if He was dead by this time, and summoning the centurion, he questioned him as to whether He was already dead. 
MRK.15.45	And ascertaining this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. 
MRK.15.46	Joseph bought a linen cloth, took Him down, wrapped Him in the linen cloth and laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. 
MRK.15.47	Mary Magdalene and Mary the 
MRK.16.1	When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the 
MRK.16.2	Very early on the first day of the week, they *came to the tomb when the sun had risen. 
MRK.16.3	They were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?” 
MRK.16.4	Looking up, they *saw that the stone had been rolled away, although it was extremely large. 
MRK.16.5	Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting at the right, wearing a white robe; and they were amazed. 
MRK.16.6	And he *said to them, “Do not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen; He is not here; behold, 
MRK.16.7	But go, tell His disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see Him, just as He told you.’ ” 
MRK.16.8	They went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had gripped them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.
MRK.16.9	[
MRK.16.10	She went and reported to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and weeping. 
MRK.16.11	When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they refused to believe it.
MRK.16.12	After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking along on their way to the country. 
MRK.16.13	They went away and reported it to the others, but they did not believe them either.
MRK.16.14	Afterward He appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining 
MRK.16.15	And He said to them, 
MRK.16.19	So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.

LUK.1.2	just as they were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the

LUK.1.10	And the whole multitude of the people were in prayer outside at the hour of the incense offering. 
LUK.1.11	And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the altar of incense. 
LUK.1.12	Zacharias was troubled when he saw 
LUK.1.13	But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will give him the name John. 
LUK.1.14	You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. 
LUK.1.15	For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; and he will drink no wine or liquor, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit while yet in his mother’s womb. 
LUK.1.16	And he will turn many of the sons of Israel back to the Lord their God.

LUK.1.20	And behold, you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day when these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.”
LUK.1.21	The people were waiting for Zacharias, and were wondering at his delay in the temple. 
LUK.1.22	But when he came out, he was unable to speak to them; and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he kept making signs to them, and remained mute. 
LUK.1.23	When the days of his priestly service were ended, he went back home.
LUK.1.24	After these days Elizabeth his wife became pregnant, and she kept herself in seclusion for five months, saying,

LUK.1.33	and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.” 
LUK.1.34	Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” 
LUK.1.35	The angel answered and said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God. 
LUK.1.36	And behold, even your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age; and she who was called barren is now in her sixth month. 
LUK.1.37	For nothing will be impossible with God.” 
LUK.1.38	And Mary said, “Behold, the 
LUK.1.39	Now at this time Mary arose and went in a hurry to the hill country, to a city of Judah, 
LUK.1.40	and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. 
LUK.1.41	When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 
LUK.1.42	And she cried out with a loud voice and said, “Blessed 
LUK.1.43	And how has it 
LUK.1.44	For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy. 
LUK.1.45	And blessed 
LUK.1.46	And Mary said:
LUK.1.46	“My soul exalts the Lord,
LUK.1.47	And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
LUK.1.48	For He has had regard for the humble state of His bondslave;
LUK.1.48	For behold, from this time on all generations will count me blessed.
LUK.1.49	For the Mighty One has done great things for me;
LUK.1.49	And holy is His name.
LUK.1.50	A
LUK.1.50	T
LUK.1.51	He has done mighty deeds with His arm;
LUK.1.51	He has scattered 
LUK.1.52	He has brought down rulers from 
LUK.1.52	And has exalted those who were humble.
LUK.1.53	H
LUK.1.53	And sent away the rich empty-handed.
LUK.1.54	He has given help to Israel His servant,
LUK.1.54	In remembrance of His mercy,
LUK.1.55	As He spoke to our fathers,
LUK.1.55	To Abraham and his descendants forever.”
LUK.1.56	And Mary stayed with her about three months, and 
LUK.1.57	Now the time had come for Elizabeth to give birth, and she gave birth to a son. 
LUK.1.58	Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had displayed His great mercy toward her; and they were rejoicing with her.
LUK.1.59	And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to call him Zacharias, after his father. 
LUK.1.60	But his mother answered and said, “No indeed; but he shall be called John.” 
LUK.1.61	And they said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who is called by that name.” 
LUK.1.62	And they made signs to his father, as to what he wanted him called. 
LUK.1.63	And he asked for a tablet and wrote as follows, “His name is John.” And they were all astonished. 
LUK.1.64	And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue 
LUK.1.65	Fear came on all those living around them; and all these matters were being talked about in all the hill country of Judea. 
LUK.1.66	All who heard them kept them in mind, saying, “What then will this child 
LUK.1.67	And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:
LUK.1.68	“Blessed 
LUK.1.68	For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people,
LUK.1.69	And has raised up a horn of salvation for us
LUK.1.69	In the house of David His servant—
LUK.1.70	As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from of old—
LUK.1.71	Salvation 
LUK.1.71	And 
LUK.1.72	To show mercy toward our fathers,
LUK.1.72	And to remember His holy covenant,
LUK.1.73	The oath which He swore to Abraham our father,
LUK.1.74	To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies,
LUK.1.74	Might serve Him without fear,
LUK.1.75	In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.
LUK.1.76	And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;
LUK.1.76	For you will go on 
LUK.1.77	To give to His people 
LUK.1.77	By the forgiveness of their sins,
LUK.1.78	Because of the tender mercy of our God,
LUK.1.78	With which the Sunrise from on high will visit us,
LUK.1.79	T
LUK.1.79	To guide our feet into the way of peace.”
LUK.1.80	And the child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit, and he lived in the deserts until the day of his public appearance to Israel.
LUK.2.1	Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a census be taken of all 
LUK.2.2	This was the first census taken while 
LUK.2.3	And everyone was on his way to register for the census, each to his own city. 
LUK.2.4	Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, 
LUK.2.5	in order to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him, and was with child. 
LUK.2.6	While they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth. 
LUK.2.7	And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
LUK.2.8	In the same region there were 
LUK.2.9	And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened. 
LUK.2.10	But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people; 
LUK.2.11	for today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is 
LUK.2.12	This 
LUK.2.13	And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
LUK.2.14	“Glory to God in the highest,
LUK.2.14	And on earth peace among men 
LUK.2.15	When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds 
LUK.2.16	So they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in the manger. 
LUK.2.17	When they had seen this, they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child. 
LUK.2.18	And all who heard it wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds. 
LUK.2.19	But Mary treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart. 
LUK.2.20	The shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as had been told them.
LUK.2.21	And when eight days had passed, before His circumcision, His name was 
LUK.2.22	And when the days for their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord 
LUK.2.23	(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “E
LUK.2.24	and to offer a sacrifice according to what was said in the Law of the Lord, “A 
LUK.2.25	And there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him. 
LUK.2.26	And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. 
LUK.2.27	And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to carry out for Him the custom of the Law, 
LUK.2.28	then he took Him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
LUK.2.29	“Now Lord, You are releasing Your bond-servant to depart in peace,
LUK.2.29	According to Your word;
LUK.2.30	For my eyes have seen Your salvation,
LUK.2.31	Which You have prepared in the presence of all peoples,
LUK.2.32	A L
LUK.2.32	And the glory of Your people Israel.”
LUK.2.33	And His father and mother were amazed at the things which were being said about Him. 
LUK.2.34	And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, “Behold, this 
LUK.2.35	and a sword will pierce even your own soul—to the end that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.”
LUK.2.36	And there was a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years and had lived with 
LUK.2.37	and then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers. 
LUK.2.38	At that very moment she came up and 
LUK.2.39	When they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth. 
LUK.2.40	The Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.
LUK.2.41	Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover. 
LUK.2.42	And when He became twelve, they went up 
LUK.2.43	and as they were returning, after spending the full number of days, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. But His parents were unaware of it, 
LUK.2.44	but supposed Him to be in the caravan, and went a day’s journey; and they 
LUK.2.45	When they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem looking for Him. 
LUK.2.46	Then, after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. 
LUK.2.47	And all who heard Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers. 
LUK.2.48	When they saw Him, they were astonished; and His mother said to Him, “Son, why have You treated us this way? Behold, Your father and I have been anxiously looking for You.” 
LUK.2.49	And He said to them, 
LUK.2.50	But they did not understand the statement which He had made to them. 
LUK.2.51	And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and He continued in subjection to them; and His mother treasured all 
LUK.2.52	And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
LUK.3.1	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene, 
LUK.3.2	in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. 
LUK.3.3	And he came into all the district around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins; 
LUK.3.4	as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
LUK.3.4	“T
LUK.3.4	‘M
LUK.3.4	M
LUK.3.5	E
LUK.3.5	A
LUK.3.5	T
LUK.3.5	A
LUK.3.6	A
LUK.3.7	So he 
LUK.3.8	Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham. 
LUK.3.9	Indeed the axe is already laid at the root of the trees; so every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”
LUK.3.10	And the crowds were questioning him, saying, “Then what shall we do?” 
LUK.3.11	And he would answer and say to them, “The man who has two tunics is to share with him who has none; and he who has food is to do likewise.” 
LUK.3.12	And 
LUK.3.13	And he said to them, “Collect no more than what you have been ordered to.” 
LUK.3.14	 soldiers were questioning him, saying, “And 
LUK.3.15	Now while the people were in a state of expectation and all were wondering in their hearts about John, as to whether he was the Christ, 
LUK.3.16	John answered and said to them all, “As for me, I baptize you with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 
LUK.3.17	His winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly clear His threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into His barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
LUK.3.18	So with many other exhortations he preached the gospel to the people. 
LUK.3.19	But when Herod the tetrarch was reprimanded by him because of Herodias, his brother’s wife, and because of all the wicked things which Herod had done, 
LUK.3.20	Herod also added this to them all: he locked John up in prison.
LUK.3.21	Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus was also baptized, and while He was praying, heaven was opened, 
LUK.3.22	and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came out of heaven, “You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased.”
LUK.3.23	When He began His ministry, Jesus Himself was about thirty years of age, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, the son of Eli, 
LUK.3.24	the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, 
LUK.3.25	the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Hesli, the son of Naggai, 
LUK.3.26	the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, 
LUK.3.27	the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, 
LUK.3.28	the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, 
LUK.3.29	the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, 
LUK.3.30	the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, 
LUK.3.31	the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, 
LUK.3.32	the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon, 
LUK.3.33	the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, 
LUK.3.34	the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, 
LUK.3.35	the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Heber, the son of Shelah, 
LUK.3.36	the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, 
LUK.3.37	the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, 
LUK.3.38	the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
LUK.4.1	Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led around by the Spirit in the wilderness 
LUK.4.2	for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days, and when they had ended, He became hungry. 
LUK.4.3	And the devil said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.” 
LUK.4.4	And Jesus answered him, 
LUK.4.5	And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
LUK.4.6	And the devil said to Him, “I will give You all this domain and its glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish. 
LUK.4.7	Therefore if You worship before me, it shall all be Yours.” 
LUK.4.8	Jesus answered him, 
LUK.4.9	And he led Him to Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here; 
LUK.4.10	for it is written,
LUK.4.10	‘H
LUK.4.11	and,
LUK.4.11	‘O
LUK.4.11	S
LUK.4.12	And Jesus answered and said to him, 
LUK.4.13	When the devil had finished every temptation, he left Him until an opportune time.
LUK.4.14	And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about Him spread through all the surrounding district. 
LUK.4.15	And He 
LUK.4.16	And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read. 
LUK.4.17	And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And He opened the book and found the place where it was written,
LUK.4.20	And He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him. 
LUK.4.21	And He began to say to them, 
LUK.4.22	And all were speaking well of Him, and wondering at the gracious words which were falling from His lips; and they were saying, “Is this not Joseph’s son?” 
LUK.4.23	And He said to them, 
LUK.4.24	And He said, 
LUK.4.28	And all 
LUK.4.29	and they got up and drove Him out of the city, and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city had been built, in order to throw Him down the cliff. 
LUK.4.30	But passing through their midst, He went His way.
LUK.4.31	And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching them on the Sabbath; 
LUK.4.32	and they were amazed at His teaching, for His message was with authority. 
LUK.4.33	In the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, 
LUK.4.34	“Let us alone! What business do we have with each other, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!” 
LUK.4.35	But Jesus rebuked him, saying, 
LUK.4.36	And amazement came upon them all, and they 
LUK.4.37	And the report about Him was spreading into every locality in the surrounding district.
LUK.4.38	Then He got up and 
LUK.4.39	And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her; and she immediately got up and waited on them.
LUK.4.40	While the sun was setting, all those who had any 
LUK.4.41	Demons also were coming out of many, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But rebuking them, He would not allow them to speak, because they knew Him to be the Christ.
LUK.4.42	When day came, Jesus left and went to a secluded place; and the crowds were searching for Him, and came to Him and tried to keep Him from going away from them. 
LUK.4.43	But He said to them, 
LUK.4.44	So He kept on preaching in the synagogues of 
LUK.5.1	Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around Him and listening to the word of God, He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret; 
LUK.5.2	and He saw two boats lying at the edge of the lake; but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets. 
LUK.5.3	And He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little way from the land. And He sat down and 
LUK.5.4	When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, 
LUK.5.5	Simon answered and said, “Master, we worked hard all night and caught nothing, but I will do as You say 
LUK.5.6	When they had done this, they enclosed a great quantity of fish, and their nets 
LUK.5.7	so they signaled to their partners in the other boat for them to come and help them. And they came and filled both of the boats, so that they began to sink. 
LUK.5.8	But when Simon Peter saw 
LUK.5.9	For amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the catch of fish which they had taken; 
LUK.5.10	and so also 
LUK.5.11	When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.
LUK.5.12	While He was in one of the cities, behold, 
LUK.5.13	And He stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, 
LUK.5.14	And He ordered him to tell no one, 
LUK.5.15	But the news about Him was spreading even farther, and large crowds were gathering to hear 
LUK.5.16	But Jesus Himself would 
LUK.5.17	One day He was teaching; and there were 
LUK.5.18	And 
LUK.5.19	But not finding any 
LUK.5.20	Seeing their faith, He said, 
LUK.5.21	The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this 
LUK.5.22	But Jesus, aware of their reasonings, answered and said to them, 
LUK.5.24	—He said to the paralytic—
LUK.5.25	Immediately he got up before them, and picked up what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God. 
LUK.5.26	They were all struck with astonishment and 
LUK.5.27	After that He went out and noticed a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax booth, and He said to him, 
LUK.5.28	And he left everything behind, and got up and 
LUK.5.29	And Levi gave a big reception for Him in his house; and there was a great crowd of tax collectors and other 
LUK.5.30	The Pharisees and their scribes 
LUK.5.31	And Jesus answered and said to them, 
LUK.5.33	And they said to Him, “The disciples of John often fast and offer prayers, the 
LUK.5.34	And Jesus said to them, 
LUK.5.36	And He was also telling them a parable: 
LUK.6.1	Now it happened that He was passing through 
LUK.6.2	But some of the Pharisees said, “Why do you do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?” 
LUK.6.3	And Jesus answering them said, 
LUK.6.5	And He was saying to them, 
LUK.6.6	On another Sabbath He entered the synagogue and was teaching; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered. 
LUK.6.7	The scribes and the Pharisees were watching Him closely 
LUK.6.8	But He knew what they were thinking, and He said to the man with the withered hand, 
LUK.6.9	And Jesus said to them, 
LUK.6.10	After looking around at them all, He said to him, 
LUK.6.11	But they themselves were filled with rage, and discussed together what they might do to Jesus.
LUK.6.12	It was at this time that He went off to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer to God. 
LUK.6.13	And when day came, He called His disciples to Him and chose twelve of them, whom He also named as apostles: 
LUK.6.14	Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew; 
LUK.6.15	and Matthew and Thomas; James 
LUK.6.16	Judas 
LUK.6.17	Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place; and 
LUK.6.18	who had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were being cured. 
LUK.6.19	And all the people were trying to touch Him, for power was coming from Him and healing 
LUK.6.20	And turning His gaze toward His disciples, He 
LUK.6.39	And He also spoke a parable to them: 
LUK.7.1	When He had completed all His discourse in the hearing of the people, He went to Capernaum.
LUK.7.2	And a centurion’s slave, who was highly regarded by him, was sick and about to die. 
LUK.7.3	When he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders asking Him to come and save the life of his slave. 
LUK.7.4	When they came to Jesus, they earnestly implored Him, saying, “He is worthy for You to grant this to him; 
LUK.7.5	for he loves our nation and it was he who built us our synagogue.” 
LUK.7.6	Now Jesus 
LUK.7.7	for this reason I did not even consider myself worthy to come to You, but 
LUK.7.8	For I also am a man placed under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.” 
LUK.7.9	Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled at him, and turned and said to the crowd that was following Him, 
LUK.7.10	When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.
LUK.7.11	Soon afterwards He went to a city called Nain; and His disciples were going along with Him, accompanied by a large crowd. 
LUK.7.12	Now as He approached the gate of the city, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a sizeable crowd from the city was with her. 
LUK.7.13	When the Lord saw her, He felt compassion for her, and said to her, 
LUK.7.14	And He came up and touched the coffin; and the bearers came to a halt. And He said, 
LUK.7.15	The dead man sat up and began to speak. And 
LUK.7.16	Fear gripped them all, and they 
LUK.7.17	This report concerning Him went out all over Judea and in all the surrounding district.
LUK.7.18	The disciples of John reported to him about all these things. 
LUK.7.19	Summoning two of his disciples, John sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are You the Expected One, or do we look for someone else?” 
LUK.7.20	When the men came to Him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to You, to ask, ‘Are You the Expected One, or do we look for someone else?’ ” 
LUK.7.21	At that very time He cured many 
LUK.7.22	And He answered and said to them, 
LUK.7.24	When the messengers of John had left, He began to speak to the crowds about John, 
LUK.7.29	When all the people and the tax collectors heard 
LUK.7.30	But the Pharisees and the 
LUK.7.36	Now one of the Pharisees was requesting Him to dine with him, and He entered the Pharisee’s house and reclined 
LUK.7.37	And there was a woman in the city who was a sinner; and when she learned that He was reclining 
LUK.7.38	and standing behind 
LUK.7.39	Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet He would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching Him, that she is a sinner.”
LUK.7.40	And Jesus answered him, 
LUK.7.43	Simon answered and said, “I suppose the one whom he forgave more.” And He said to him, 
LUK.7.44	Turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, 
LUK.7.48	Then He said to her, 
LUK.7.49	Those who were reclining 
LUK.7.50	And He said to the woman, 
LUK.8.1	Soon afterwards, He 
LUK.8.2	and 
LUK.8.3	and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others who were contributing to their support out of their private means.
LUK.8.4	When a large crowd was coming together, and those from the various cities were journeying to Him, He spoke by way of a parable: 
LUK.8.8	 As He said these things, He would call out, 
LUK.8.9	His disciples 
LUK.8.10	And He said, 
LUK.8.19	And His mother and brothers came to Him, and they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd. 
LUK.8.20	And it was reported to Him, “Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, wishing to see You.” 
LUK.8.21	But He answered and said to them, 
LUK.8.22	Now on one of 
LUK.8.23	But as they were sailing along He fell asleep; and a fierce gale of wind descended on the lake, and they 
LUK.8.24	They came to Jesus and woke Him up, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” And He got up and rebuked the wind and the surging waves, and they stopped, and it became calm. 
LUK.8.25	And He said to them, 
LUK.8.26	Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. 
LUK.8.27	And when He came out onto the land, He was met by a man from the city who was possessed with demons; and who had not put on any clothing for a long time, and was not living in a house, but in the tombs. 
LUK.8.28	Seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell before Him, and said in a loud voice, “What business do we have with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me.” 
LUK.8.29	For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him many times; and he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, and 
LUK.8.30	And Jesus asked him, 
LUK.8.31	They were imploring Him not to command them to go away into the abyss.
LUK.8.32	Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain; and 
LUK.8.33	And the demons came out of the man and entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
LUK.8.34	When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and reported it in the city and 
LUK.8.35	 went out to see what had happened; and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting down at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they became frightened. 
LUK.8.36	Those who had seen it reported to them how the man who was demon-possessed had been made well. 
LUK.8.37	And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes and the surrounding district asked Him to leave them, for they were gripped with great fear; and He got into a boat and returned. 
LUK.8.38	But the man from whom the demons had gone out was begging Him that he might accompany Him; but He sent him away, saying, 
LUK.8.39	 So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.
LUK.8.40	And as Jesus returned, the people welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him. 
LUK.8.41	And there came a man named Jairus, and he was an official of the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus’ feet, and 
LUK.8.42	for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But as He went, the crowds were pressing against Him.
LUK.8.43	And a woman who had a hemorrhage for twelve years, and could not be healed by anyone, 
LUK.8.44	came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak, and immediately her hemorrhage stopped. 
LUK.8.45	And Jesus said, 
LUK.8.46	But Jesus said, 
LUK.8.47	When the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling and fell down before Him, and declared in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him, and how she had been immediately healed. 
LUK.8.48	And He said to her, 
LUK.8.49	While He was still speaking, someone *came from 
LUK.8.50	But when Jesus heard 
LUK.8.51	When He came to the house, He did not allow anyone to enter with Him, except Peter and John and James, and the girl’s father and mother. 
LUK.8.52	Now they were all weeping and lamenting for her; but He said, 
LUK.8.53	And they 
LUK.8.54	He, however, took her by the hand and called, saying, 
LUK.8.55	And her spirit returned, and she got up immediately; and He gave orders for 
LUK.8.56	Her parents were amazed; but He instructed them to tell no one what had happened.
LUK.9.1	And He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases. 
LUK.9.2	And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to perform healing. 
LUK.9.3	And He said to them, 
LUK.9.6	Departing, they 
LUK.9.7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was happening; and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead, 
LUK.9.8	and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen again. 
LUK.9.9	Herod said, “I myself had John beheaded; but who is this man about whom I hear such things?” And he kept trying to see Him.
LUK.9.10	When the apostles returned, they gave an account to Him of all that they had done. Taking them with Him, He withdrew by Himself to a city called Bethsaida. 
LUK.9.11	But the crowds were aware of this and followed Him; and welcoming them, He 
LUK.9.12	Now the day was ending, and the twelve came and said to Him, “Send the crowd away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and get something to eat; for here we are in a desolate place.” 
LUK.9.13	But He said to them, 
LUK.9.14	(For there were about five thousand men.) And He said to His disciples, 
LUK.9.15	They did so, and had them all sit down. 
LUK.9.16	Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed them, and broke 
LUK.9.17	And they all ate and were satisfied; and the broken pieces which they had left over were picked up, twelve baskets 
LUK.9.18	And it happened that while He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He questioned them, saying, 
LUK.9.19	They answered and said, “John the Baptist, and others 
LUK.9.20	And He said to them, 
LUK.9.21	But He warned them and instructed 
LUK.9.22	saying, 
LUK.9.23	And He was saying to 
LUK.9.28	Some eight days after these sayings, He took along Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. 
LUK.9.29	And while He was praying, the appearance of His face became different, and His clothing 
LUK.9.30	And behold, two men were talking with Him; and they were Moses and Elijah, 
LUK.9.31	who, appearing in glory, were speaking of His departure which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.32	Now Peter and his companions had been overcome with sleep; but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men standing with Him. 
LUK.9.33	And as these were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles: one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah”—not realizing what he was saying. 
LUK.9.34	While he was saying this, a cloud formed and 
LUK.9.35	Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, 
LUK.9.36	And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.
LUK.9.37	On the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Him. 
LUK.9.38	And a man from the crowd shouted, saying, “Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only 
LUK.9.39	and a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly screams, and it throws him into a convulsion with foaming 
LUK.9.40	I begged Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not.” 
LUK.9.41	And Jesus answered and said, 
LUK.9.42	While he was still approaching, the demon slammed him 
LUK.9.43	And they were all amazed at the greatness of God.
LUK.9.45	But they did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they would not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this statement.
LUK.9.46	An argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest. 
LUK.9.47	But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking in their heart, took a child and stood him by His side, 
LUK.9.48	and said to them, 
LUK.9.49	John answered and said, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name; and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow along with us.” 
LUK.9.50	But Jesus said to him, 
LUK.9.51	When the days were approaching for His ascension, He was determined to go to Jerusalem; 
LUK.9.52	and He sent messengers on ahead of Him, and they went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for Him. 
LUK.9.53	But they did not receive Him, because He was traveling toward Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.54	When His disciples James and John saw 
LUK.9.55	But He turned and rebuked them, [and said, 
LUK.9.56	] And they went on to another village.
LUK.9.57	As they were going along the road, someone said to Him, “I will follow You wherever You go.” 
LUK.9.58	And Jesus said to him, 
LUK.9.59	And He said to another, 
LUK.9.60	But He said to him, 
LUK.9.61	Another also said, “I will follow You, Lord; but first permit me to say good-bye to those at home.” 
LUK.9.62	But Jesus said to him, 
LUK.10.1	Now after this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them in pairs ahead of Him to every city and place where He Himself was going to come. 
LUK.10.2	And He was saying to them, 
LUK.10.17	The seventy returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.” 
LUK.10.18	And He said to them, 
LUK.10.21	At that very time He rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, 
LUK.10.23	Turning to the disciples, He said privately, 
LUK.10.25	And a lawyer stood up and put Him to the test, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” 
LUK.10.26	And He said to him, 
LUK.10.27	And he answered, “Y
LUK.10.28	And He said to him, 
LUK.10.29	But wishing to justify himself, he said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”
LUK.10.30	Jesus replied and said, 
LUK.10.37	And he said, “The one who showed mercy toward him.” Then Jesus said to him, 
LUK.10.38	Now as they were traveling along, He entered a village; and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home. 
LUK.10.39	She had a sister called Mary, who was seated at the Lord’s feet, listening to His word. 
LUK.10.40	But Martha was distracted with all her preparations; and she came up 
LUK.10.41	But the Lord answered and said to her, 
LUK.11.1	It happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place, after He had finished, one of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, teach us to pray just as John also taught his disciples.” 
LUK.11.2	And He said to them, 
LUK.11.5	Then He said to them, 
LUK.11.14	And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute; when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds were amazed. 
LUK.11.15	But some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.” 
LUK.11.16	Others, to test 
LUK.11.17	But He knew their thoughts and said to them, 
LUK.11.27	While Jesus was saying these things, one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, “Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts at which You nursed.” 
LUK.11.28	But He said, 
LUK.11.29	As the crowds were increasing, He began to say, 
LUK.11.37	Now when He had spoken, a Pharisee *asked Him to have lunch with him; and He went in, and reclined 
LUK.11.38	When the Pharisee saw it, he was surprised that He had not first ceremonially washed before the meal. 
LUK.11.39	But the Lord said to him, 
LUK.11.45	One of the 
LUK.11.46	But He said, 
LUK.11.53	When He left there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile and to question Him closely on many subjects, 
LUK.11.54	plotting against Him to catch 
LUK.12.1	Under these circumstances, after so many thousands of people had gathered together that they were stepping on one another, He began saying to His disciples first 
LUK.12.13	Someone in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the 
LUK.12.14	But He said to him, 
LUK.12.15	Then He said to them, 
LUK.12.16	And He told them a parable, saying, 
LUK.12.22	And He said to His disciples, 
LUK.12.41	Peter said, “Lord, are You addressing this parable to us, or to everyone 
LUK.12.42	And the Lord said, 
LUK.12.54	And He was also saying to the crowds, 
LUK.13.1	Now on the same occasion there were some present who reported to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 
LUK.13.2	And Jesus said to them, 
LUK.13.6	And He 
LUK.13.10	And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. 
LUK.13.11	And there was a woman who for eighteen years had had a sickness caused by a spirit; and she was bent double, and could not straighten up at all. 
LUK.13.12	When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said to her, 
LUK.13.13	And He laid His hands on her; and immediately she was made erect again and 
LUK.13.14	But the synagogue official, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, 
LUK.13.15	But the Lord answered him and said, 
LUK.13.17	As He said this, all His opponents were being humiliated; and the entire crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things being done by Him.
LUK.13.18	So He was saying, 
LUK.13.20	And again He said, 
LUK.13.22	And He was passing through from one city and village to another, teaching, and proceeding on His way to Jerusalem. 
LUK.13.23	And someone said to Him, “Lord, are there 
LUK.13.31	Just at that time some Pharisees approached, saying to Him, “Go away, leave here, for Herod wants to kill You.” 
LUK.13.32	And He said to them, 
LUK.14.1	It happened that when He went into the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees on 
LUK.14.2	And there in front of Him was a man suffering from dropsy. 
LUK.14.3	And Jesus answered and spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, 
LUK.14.4	But they kept silent. And He took hold of him and healed him, and sent him away. 
LUK.14.5	And He said to them, 
LUK.14.6	And they could make no reply to this.
LUK.14.7	And He 
LUK.14.12	And He also went on to say to the one who had invited Him, 
LUK.14.15	When one of those who were reclining 
LUK.14.16	But He said to him, 
LUK.14.25	Now large crowds were going along with Him; and He turned and said to them, 
LUK.15.1	Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming near Him to listen to Him. 
LUK.15.2	Both the Pharisees and the scribes 
LUK.15.3	So He told them this parable, saying, 
LUK.15.11	And He said, 
LUK.16.1	Now He was also saying to the disciples, 
LUK.16.14	Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all these things and were scoffing at Him. 
LUK.16.15	And He said to them, 
LUK.17.1	He said to His disciples, 
LUK.17.5	The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” 
LUK.17.6	And the Lord said, 
LUK.17.11	While He was on the way to Jerusalem, He was passing between Samaria and Galilee. 
LUK.17.12	As He entered a village, ten leprous men who stood at a distance met Him; 
LUK.17.13	and they raised their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!” 
LUK.17.14	When He saw them, He said to them, 
LUK.17.15	Now one of them, when he saw that he had been healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice, 
LUK.17.16	and he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him. And he was a Samaritan. 
LUK.17.17	Then Jesus answered and said, 
LUK.17.19	And He said to him, 
LUK.17.20	Now having been questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God was coming, He answered them and said, 
LUK.17.22	And He said to the disciples, 
LUK.17.36	[
LUK.17.37	And answering they *said to Him, “Where, Lord?” And He said to them, 
LUK.18.1	Now He was telling them a parable to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart, 
LUK.18.2	saying, 
LUK.18.6	And the Lord said, 
LUK.18.9	And He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and viewed others with contempt: 
LUK.18.15	And they were bringing even their babies to Him so that He would touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they 
LUK.18.16	But Jesus called for them, saying, 
LUK.18.18	A ruler questioned Him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” 
LUK.18.19	And Jesus said to him, 
LUK.18.21	And he said, “All these things I have kept from 
LUK.18.22	When Jesus heard 
LUK.18.23	But when he had heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. 
LUK.18.24	And Jesus looked at him and said, 
LUK.18.26	They who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?” 
LUK.18.27	But He said, 
LUK.18.28	Peter said, “Behold, we have left our own 
LUK.18.29	And He said to them, 
LUK.18.31	Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, 
LUK.18.34	But the disciples understood none of these things, and 
LUK.18.35	As Jesus was approaching Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the road begging. 
LUK.18.36	Now hearing a crowd going by, he 
LUK.18.37	They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. 
LUK.18.38	And he called out, saying, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 
LUK.18.39	Those who led the way were sternly telling him to be quiet; but he kept crying out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 
LUK.18.40	And Jesus stopped and commanded that he be brought to Him; and when he came near, He questioned him, 
LUK.18.41	 And he said, “Lord, 
LUK.18.42	And Jesus said to him, 
LUK.18.43	Immediately he regained his sight and 
LUK.19.1	He entered Jericho and was passing through. 
LUK.19.2	And there was a man called by the name of Zaccheus; he was a chief tax collector and he was rich. 
LUK.19.3	Zaccheus was trying to see who Jesus was, and was unable because of the crowd, for he was small in stature. 
LUK.19.4	So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass through that way. 
LUK.19.5	When Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, 
LUK.19.6	And he hurried and came down and received Him gladly. 
LUK.19.7	When they saw it, they all 
LUK.19.8	Zaccheus stopped and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, half of my possessions I will give to the poor, and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give back four times as much.” 
LUK.19.9	And Jesus said to him, 
LUK.19.11	While they were listening to these things, Jesus went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately. 
LUK.19.12	So He said, 
LUK.19.28	After He had said these things, He was going on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
LUK.19.29	When He approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the mount that is called Olivet, He sent two of the disciples, 
LUK.19.30	saying, 
LUK.19.32	So those who were sent went away and found it just as He had told them. 
LUK.19.33	As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?” 
LUK.19.34	They said, “The Lord has need of it.” 
LUK.19.35	They brought it to Jesus, and they threw their coats on the colt and put Jesus 
LUK.19.36	As He was going, they were spreading their coats on the road. 
LUK.19.37	As soon as He was approaching, near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen, 
LUK.19.38	shouting:
LUK.19.38	“B
LUK.19.38	Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”
LUK.19.39	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.” 
LUK.19.40	But Jesus answered, 
LUK.19.41	When He approached 
LUK.19.42	saying, 
LUK.19.45	Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling, 
LUK.19.46	saying to them, 
LUK.19.47	And He was teaching daily in the temple; but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people were trying to destroy Him, 
LUK.19.48	and they could not find anything that they might do, for all the people were hanging on to every word He said.
LUK.20.1	On one of the days while He was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders confronted 
LUK.20.2	and they spoke, saying to Him, “Tell us by what authority You are doing these things, or who is the one who gave You this authority?” 
LUK.20.3	Jesus answered and said to them, 
LUK.20.5	They reasoned among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’ 
LUK.20.6	But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.” 
LUK.20.7	So they answered that they did not know where 
LUK.20.8	And Jesus said to them, 
LUK.20.9	And He began to tell the people this parable: 
LUK.20.16	 When they heard it, they said, “May it never be!” 
LUK.20.17	But Jesus looked at them and said, 
LUK.20.19	The scribes and the chief priests tried to lay hands on Him that very hour, and they feared the people; for they understood that He spoke this parable against them. 
LUK.20.20	So they watched Him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, in order that they might catch Him in some statement, so that they 
LUK.20.21	They questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth. 
LUK.20.22	Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” 
LUK.20.23	But He detected their trickery and said to them, 
LUK.20.24	 They said, “Caesar’s.” 
LUK.20.25	And He said to them, 
LUK.20.26	And they were unable to catch Him in a saying in the presence of the people; and being amazed at His answer, they became silent.
LUK.20.27	Now there came to Him some of the Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection), 
LUK.20.28	and they questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that 
LUK.20.29	Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and died childless; 
LUK.20.30	and the second 
LUK.20.31	and the third married her; and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children. 
LUK.20.32	Finally the woman died also. 
LUK.20.33	In the resurrection therefore, which one’s wife will she be? For all seven had married her.”
LUK.20.34	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.20.39	Some of the scribes answered and said, “Teacher, You have spoken well.” 
LUK.20.40	For they did not have courage to question Him any longer about anything.
LUK.20.41	Then He said to them, 
LUK.20.45	And while all the people were listening, He said to the disciples, 
LUK.21.1	And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury. 
LUK.21.2	And He saw a poor widow putting in two small copper coins. 
LUK.21.3	And He said, 
LUK.21.5	And while some were talking about the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and votive gifts, He said, 
LUK.21.7	They questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, when therefore will these things happen? And what 
LUK.21.8	And He said, 
LUK.21.10	Then He continued by saying to them, 
LUK.21.29	Then He told them a parable: 
LUK.21.37	Now during the day He was teaching in the temple, but at evening He would go out and spend the night on the mount that is called Olivet. 
LUK.21.38	And all the people would get up early in the morning 
LUK.22.1	Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching. 
LUK.22.2	The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put Him to death; for they were afraid of the people.
LUK.22.3	And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the twelve. 
LUK.22.4	And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray Him to them. 
LUK.22.5	They were glad and agreed to give him money. 
LUK.22.6	So he consented, and 
LUK.22.7	Then came the 
LUK.22.8	And Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, 
LUK.22.9	They said to Him, “Where do You want us to prepare it?” 
LUK.22.10	And He said to them, 
LUK.22.13	And they left and found 
LUK.22.14	When the hour had come, He reclined 
LUK.22.15	And He said to them, 
LUK.22.17	And when He had taken a cup 
LUK.22.19	And when He had taken 
LUK.22.20	And in the same way 
LUK.22.23	And they began to discuss among themselves which one of them it might be who was going to do this thing.
LUK.22.24	And there arose also a dispute among them 
LUK.22.25	And He said to them, 
LUK.22.33	But he said to Him, “Lord, with You I am ready to go both to prison and to death!” 
LUK.22.34	And He said, 
LUK.22.35	And He said to them, 
LUK.22.36	And He said to them, 
LUK.22.38	They said, “Lord, look, here are two swords.” And He said to them, 
LUK.22.39	And He came out and proceeded as was His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him. 
LUK.22.40	When He arrived at the place, He said to them, 
LUK.22.41	And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and He knelt down and 
LUK.22.42	saying, 
LUK.22.43	Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him. 
LUK.22.44	And being in agony He was praying very fervently; and His sweat became like drops of blood, falling down upon the ground. 
LUK.22.45	When He rose from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow, 
LUK.22.46	and said to them, 
LUK.22.47	While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd 
LUK.22.48	But Jesus said to him, 
LUK.22.49	When those who were around Him saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” 
LUK.22.50	And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. 
LUK.22.51	But Jesus answered and said, 
LUK.22.52	Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come against Him, 
LUK.22.54	Having arrested Him, they led Him 
LUK.22.55	After they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter was sitting among them. 
LUK.22.56	And a servant-girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight and looking intently at him, said, “This man was with Him too.” 
LUK.22.57	But he denied 
LUK.22.58	A little later, another saw him and said, “You are 
LUK.22.59	After about an hour had passed, another man 
LUK.22.60	But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about.” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 
LUK.22.61	The Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him, 
LUK.22.62	And he went out and wept bitterly.
LUK.22.63	Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking Him and beating Him, 
LUK.22.64	and they blindfolded Him and were asking Him, saying, “Prophesy, who is the one who hit You?” 
LUK.22.65	And they were saying many other things against Him, blaspheming.
LUK.22.66	When it was day, the 
LUK.22.67	“If You are the Christ, tell us.” But He said to them, 
LUK.22.70	And they all said, “Are You the Son of God, then?” And He said to them, 
LUK.22.71	Then they said, “What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth.”
LUK.23.1	Then the whole body of them got up and brought Him before Pilate. 
LUK.23.2	And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.” 
LUK.23.3	So Pilate asked Him, saying, “Are You the King of the Jews?” And He answered him and said, 
LUK.23.4	Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no guilt in this man.” 
LUK.23.5	But they kept on insisting, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching all over Judea, starting from Galilee even as far as this place.”
LUK.23.6	When Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. 
LUK.23.7	And when he learned that He belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself also was in Jerusalem at that time.
LUK.23.8	Now Herod was very glad when he saw Jesus; for he had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had been hearing about Him and was hoping to see some sign performed by Him. 
LUK.23.9	And he questioned Him at some length; but He answered him nothing. 
LUK.23.10	And the chief priests and the scribes were standing there, accusing Him vehemently. 
LUK.23.11	And Herod with his soldiers, after treating Him with contempt and mocking Him, dressed Him in a gorgeous robe and sent Him back to Pilate. 
LUK.23.12	Now Herod and Pilate became friends with one another that very day; for before they had been enemies with each other.
LUK.23.13	Pilate summoned the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 
LUK.23.14	and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one who incites the people to rebellion, and behold, having examined Him before you, I have found no guilt in this man regarding the charges which you make against Him. 
LUK.23.15	No, nor has Herod, for he sent Him back to us; and behold, nothing deserving death has been done by Him. 
LUK.23.16	Therefore I will punish Him and release Him.” 
LUK.23.17	[
LUK.23.18	But they cried out all together, saying, “Away with this man, and release for us Barabbas!” 
LUK.23.19	(He was one who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection made in the city, and for murder.) 
LUK.23.20	Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again, 
LUK.23.21	but they kept on calling out, saying, “Crucify, crucify Him!” 
LUK.23.22	And he said to them the third time, “Why, what evil has this man done? I have found in Him no guilt 
LUK.23.23	But they were insistent, with loud voices asking that He be crucified. And their voices 
LUK.23.24	And Pilate pronounced sentence that their demand be granted. 
LUK.23.25	And he released the man they were asking for who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, but he delivered Jesus to their will.
LUK.23.26	When they led Him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, coming in from the country, and placed on him the cross to carry behind Jesus.
LUK.23.27	And following Him was a large crowd of the people, and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him. 
LUK.23.28	But Jesus turning to them said, 
LUK.23.32	Two others also, who were criminals, were being led away to be put to death with Him.
LUK.23.33	When they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left. 
LUK.23.34	But Jesus was saying, 
LUK.23.35	And the people stood by, looking on. And even the rulers were sneering at Him, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, His Chosen One.” 
LUK.23.36	The soldiers also mocked Him, coming up to Him, offering Him sour wine, 
LUK.23.37	and saying, “If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!” 
LUK.23.38	Now there was also an inscription above Him, “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
LUK.23.39	One of the criminals who were hanged 
LUK.23.40	But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? 
LUK.23.41	And we indeed 
LUK.23.42	And he was saying, “Jesus, remember me when You come in Your kingdom!” 
LUK.23.43	And He said to him, 
LUK.23.44	It was now about 
LUK.23.45	because the sun was obscured; and the veil of the temple was torn in two. 
LUK.23.46	And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, 
LUK.23.47	Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he 
LUK.23.48	And all the crowds who came together for this spectacle, when they observed what had happened, 
LUK.23.49	And all His acquaintances and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee were standing at a distance, seeing these things.
LUK.23.50	And a man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council, a good and righteous man 
LUK.23.51	(he had not consented to their plan and action), 
LUK.23.52	this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 
LUK.23.53	And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever lain. 
LUK.23.54	It was the preparation day, and the Sabbath was about to begin. 
LUK.23.55	Now the women who had come with Him out of Galilee followed, and saw the tomb and how His body was laid. 
LUK.23.56	Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes.
LUK.24.1	But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared. 
LUK.24.2	And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, 
LUK.24.3	but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 
LUK.24.4	While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men suddenly stood near them in dazzling clothing; 
LUK.24.5	and as 
LUK.24.6	He is not here, but He has risen. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee, 
LUK.24.7	saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.” 
LUK.24.8	And they remembered His words, 
LUK.24.9	and returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. 
LUK.24.10	Now they were Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the 
LUK.24.11	But these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they would not believe them. 
LUK.24.12	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he *saw the linen wrappings only; and he went away to his home, marveling at what had happened.
LUK.24.13	And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was 
LUK.24.14	And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place. 
LUK.24.15	While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and 
LUK.24.16	But their eyes were prevented from recognizing Him. 
LUK.24.17	And He said to them, 
LUK.24.18	One 
LUK.24.19	And He said to them, 
LUK.24.20	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to the sentence of death, and crucified Him. 
LUK.24.21	But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since these things happened. 
LUK.24.22	But also some women among us amazed us. When they were at the tomb early in the morning, 
LUK.24.23	and did not find His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive. 
LUK.24.24	Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women also had said; but Him they did not see.” 
LUK.24.25	And He said to them, 
LUK.24.27	Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures.
LUK.24.28	And they approached the village where they were going, and He acted as though He were going farther. 
LUK.24.29	But they urged Him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is 
LUK.24.30	When He had reclined 
LUK.24.31	Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished from their sight. 
LUK.24.32	They said to one another, “Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was explaining the Scriptures to us?” 
LUK.24.33	And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven and those who were with them, 
LUK.24.34	saying, “The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon.” 
LUK.24.35	They 
LUK.24.36	While they were telling these things, He Himself stood in their midst and *said to them, 
LUK.24.37	But they were startled and frightened and thought that they were seeing a spirit. 
LUK.24.38	And He said to them, 
LUK.24.40	And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet. 
LUK.24.41	While they still could not believe 
LUK.24.42	They gave Him a piece of a broiled fish; 
LUK.24.43	and He took it and ate 
LUK.24.44	Now He said to them, 
LUK.24.45	Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, 
LUK.24.46	and He said to them, 
LUK.24.50	And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them. 
LUK.24.51	While He was blessing them, He parted from them and was carried up into heaven. 
LUK.24.52	And they, after worshiping Him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy, 
LUK.24.53	and were continually in the temple praising God.
JHN.1.1	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
JHN.1.2	He was in the beginning with God. 
JHN.1.3	All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being. 
JHN.1.4	In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men. 
JHN.1.5	The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not 
JHN.1.6	There 
JHN.1.7	He came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through him. 
JHN.1.8	He was not the Light, but 
JHN.1.9	There was the true Light 
JHN.1.10	He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. 
JHN.1.11	He came to His 
JHN.1.12	But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, 
JHN.1.13	who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
JHN.1.14	And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. 
JHN.1.15	John *testified about Him and cried out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.’ ” 
JHN.1.16	For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace. 
JHN.1.17	For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ. 
JHN.1.18	No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained 
JHN.1.19	This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” 
JHN.1.20	And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” 
JHN.1.21	They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” And he *said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.” 
JHN.1.22	Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?” 
JHN.1.23	He said, “I am 
JHN.1.24	Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. 
JHN.1.25	They asked him, and said to him, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” 
JHN.1.26	John answered them saying, “I baptize 
JHN.1.27	 He who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.” 
JHN.1.28	These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
JHN.1.29	The next day he *saw Jesus coming to him and *said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! 
JHN.1.30	This is He on behalf of whom I said, ‘After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.’ 
JHN.1.31	I did not recognize Him, but so that He might be manifested to Israel, I came baptizing 
JHN.1.32	John testified saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him. 
JHN.1.33	I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptize 
JHN.1.34	I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.”
JHN.1.35	Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples, 
JHN.1.36	and he looked at Jesus as He walked, and *said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” 
JHN.1.37	The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 
JHN.1.38	And Jesus turned and saw them following, and *said to them, 
JHN.1.39	He *said to them, 
JHN.1.40	One of the two who heard John 
JHN.1.41	He *found first his own brother Simon and *said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which translated means Christ). 
JHN.1.42	He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, 
JHN.1.43	The next day He purposed to go into Galilee, and He *found Philip. And Jesus *said to him, 
JHN.1.44	Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. 
JHN.1.45	Philip *found Nathanael and *said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and 
JHN.1.46	Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Philip *said to him, “Come and see.” 
JHN.1.47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and *said of him, 
JHN.1.48	Nathanael *said to Him, “How do You know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, 
JHN.1.49	Nathanael answered Him, “Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel.” 
JHN.1.50	Jesus answered and said to him, 
JHN.1.51	And He *said to him, 
JHN.2.1	On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there; 
JHN.2.2	and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding. 
JHN.2.3	When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus *said to Him, “They have no wine.” 
JHN.2.4	And Jesus *said to her, 
JHN.2.5	His mother *said to the servants, “Whatever He says to you, do it.” 
JHN.2.6	Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons each. 
JHN.2.7	Jesus *said to them, 
JHN.2.8	And He *said to them, 
JHN.2.9	When the headwaiter tasted the water which had become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter *called the bridegroom, 
JHN.2.10	and *said to him, “Every man serves the good wine first, and when 
JHN.2.11	This beginning of 
JHN.2.12	After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and 
JHN.2.13	The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
JHN.2.14	And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated 
JHN.2.15	And He made a scourge of cords, and drove 
JHN.2.16	and to those who were selling the doves He said, 
JHN.2.17	His disciples remembered that it was written, “Z
JHN.2.18	The Jews then said to Him, “What sign do You show us as your authority for doing these things?” 
JHN.2.19	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.2.20	The Jews then said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?” 
JHN.2.21	But He was speaking of the temple of His body. 
JHN.2.22	So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.
JHN.2.23	Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, observing His signs which He was doing. 
JHN.2.24	But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to them, for He knew all men, 
JHN.2.25	and because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man.
JHN.3.1	Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; 
JHN.3.2	this man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You have come from God 
JHN.3.3	Jesus answered and said to him, 
JHN.3.4	Nicodemus *said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?” 
JHN.3.5	Jesus answered, 
JHN.3.9	Nicodemus said to Him, “How can these things be?” 
JHN.3.10	Jesus answered and said to him, 
JHN.3.22	After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He was spending time with them and baptizing. 
JHN.3.23	John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and 
JHN.3.24	for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
JHN.3.25	Therefore there arose a discussion on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purification. 
JHN.3.26	And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him.” 
JHN.3.27	John answered and said, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven. 
JHN.3.28	You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent ahead of Him.’ 
JHN.3.29	He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. So this joy of mine has been made full. 
JHN.3.30	He must increase, but I must decrease.
JHN.3.31	“He who comes from above is above all, he who is of the earth is from the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. 
JHN.3.32	What He has seen and heard, of that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony. 
JHN.3.33	He who has received His testimony has set his seal to 
JHN.3.34	For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for He gives the Spirit without measure. 
JHN.3.35	The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand. 
JHN.3.36	He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”
JHN.4.1	Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John 
JHN.4.2	(although Jesus Himself was not baptizing, but His disciples were), 
JHN.4.3	He left Judea and went away again into Galilee. 
JHN.4.4	And He had to pass through Samaria. 
JHN.4.5	So He *came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph; 
JHN.4.6	and Jacob’s well was there. So Jesus, being wearied from His journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about 
JHN.4.7	There *came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus *said to her, 
JHN.4.8	For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. 
JHN.4.9	Therefore the Samaritan woman *said to Him, “How is it that You, being a Jew, ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) 
JHN.4.10	Jesus answered and said to her, 
JHN.4.11	She *said to Him, “Sir, You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep; where then do You get that living water? 
JHN.4.12	You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself and his sons and his cattle?” 
JHN.4.13	Jesus answered and said to her, 
JHN.4.15	The woman *said to Him, “Sir, give me this water, so I will not be thirsty nor come all the way here to draw.” 
JHN.4.16	He *said to her, 
JHN.4.17	The woman answered and said, “I have no husband.” Jesus *said to her, 
JHN.4.19	The woman *said to Him, “Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. 
JHN.4.20	Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you 
JHN.4.21	Jesus *said to her, 
JHN.4.25	The woman *said to Him, “I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when that One comes, He will declare all things to us.” 
JHN.4.26	Jesus *said to her, 
JHN.4.27	At this point His disciples came, and they were amazed that He had been speaking with a woman, yet no one said, “What do You seek?” or, “Why do You speak with her?” 
JHN.4.28	So the woman left her waterpot, and went into the city and *said to the men, 
JHN.4.29	“Come, see a man who told me all the things that I 
JHN.4.30	They went out of the city, and were coming to Him.
JHN.4.31	Meanwhile the disciples were urging Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.” 
JHN.4.32	But He said to them, 
JHN.4.33	So the disciples were saying to one another, “No one brought Him 
JHN.4.34	Jesus *said to them, 
JHN.4.39	From that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me all the things that I 
JHN.4.40	So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days. 
JHN.4.41	Many more believed because of His word; 
JHN.4.42	and they were saying to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One is indeed the Savior of the world.”
JHN.4.43	After the two days He went forth from there into Galilee. 
JHN.4.44	For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country. 
JHN.4.45	So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves also went to the feast.
JHN.4.46	Therefore He came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum. 
JHN.4.47	When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and was imploring 
JHN.4.48	So Jesus said to him, 
JHN.4.49	The royal official *said to Him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.” 
JHN.4.50	Jesus *said to him, 
JHN.4.51	As he was now going down, 
JHN.4.52	So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. Then they said to him, “Yesterday at the 
JHN.4.53	So the father knew that 
JHN.4.54	This is again a second sign that Jesus performed when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.
JHN.5.1	After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
JHN.5.2	Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep 
JHN.5.3	In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, [
JHN.5.4	for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool and stirred up the water; whoever then first, after the stirring up of the water, stepped in was made well from whatever disease with which he was afflicted.] 
JHN.5.5	A man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years. 
JHN.5.6	When Jesus saw him lying 
JHN.5.7	The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me.” 
JHN.5.8	Jesus *said to him, 
JHN.5.9	Immediately the man became well, and picked up his pallet and 
JHN.5.10	So the Jews were saying to the man who was cured, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not permissible for you to carry your pallet.” 
JHN.5.11	But he answered them, “He who made me well was the one who said to me, 
JHN.5.12	They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, 
JHN.5.13	But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in 
JHN.5.14	Afterward Jesus *found him in the temple and said to him, 
JHN.5.15	The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. 
JHN.5.16	For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath. 
JHN.5.17	But He answered them, 
JHN.5.18	For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
JHN.5.19	Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, 
JHN.6.1	After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias). 
JHN.6.2	A large crowd followed Him, because they saw the signs which He was performing on those who were sick. 
JHN.6.3	Then Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat down with His disciples. 
JHN.6.4	Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near. 
JHN.6.5	Therefore Jesus, lifting up His eyes and seeing that a large crowd was coming to Him, *said to Philip, 
JHN.6.6	This He was saying to test him, for He Himself knew what He was intending to do. 
JHN.6.7	Philip answered Him, “Two hundred 
JHN.6.8	One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, *said to Him, 
JHN.6.9	“There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so many people?” 
JHN.6.10	Jesus said, 
JHN.6.11	Jesus then took the loaves, and having given thanks, He distributed to those who were seated; likewise also of the fish as much as they wanted. 
JHN.6.12	When they were filled, He *said to His disciples, 
JHN.6.13	So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten. 
JHN.6.14	Therefore when the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.”
JHN.6.15	So Jesus, perceiving that they were intending to come and take Him by force to make Him king, withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone.
JHN.6.16	Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, 
JHN.6.17	and after getting into a boat, they 
JHN.6.18	The sea 
JHN.6.19	Then, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they *saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat; and they were frightened. 
JHN.6.20	But He *said to them, 
JHN.6.21	So they were willing to receive Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.
JHN.6.22	The next day the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other small boat there, except one, and that Jesus had not entered with His disciples into the boat, but 
JHN.6.23	There came other small boats from Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks. 
JHN.6.24	So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus. 
JHN.6.25	When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?”
JHN.6.26	Jesus answered them and said, 
JHN.6.28	Therefore they said to Him, “What shall we do, so that we may work the works of God?” 
JHN.6.29	Jesus answered and said to them, 
JHN.6.30	So they said to Him, “What then do You do for a sign, so that we may see, and believe You? What work do You perform? 
JHN.6.31	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ‘H
JHN.6.32	Jesus then said to them, 
JHN.6.34	Then they said to Him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”
JHN.6.35	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.41	Therefore the Jews were grumbling about Him, because He said, 
JHN.6.42	They were saying, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, 
JHN.6.43	Jesus answered and said to them, 
JHN.6.52	Then the Jews 
JHN.6.53	So Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.59	These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.
JHN.6.60	Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard 
JHN.6.61	But Jesus, conscious that His disciples grumbled at this, said to them, 
JHN.6.64	 For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was that would betray Him. 
JHN.6.65	And He was saying, 
JHN.6.66	As a result of this many of His disciples withdrew and were not walking with Him anymore. 
JHN.6.67	So Jesus said to the twelve, 
JHN.6.68	Simon Peter answered Him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life. 
JHN.6.69	We have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God.” 
JHN.6.70	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.6.71	Now He meant Judas 
JHN.7.1	After these things Jesus was walking in Galilee, for He was unwilling to walk in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill Him. 
JHN.7.2	Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was near. 
JHN.7.3	Therefore His brothers said to Him, “Leave here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see Your works which You are doing. 
JHN.7.4	For no one does anything in secret when he himself seeks to be 
JHN.7.5	For not even His brothers were believing in Him. 
JHN.7.6	So Jesus *said to them, 
JHN.7.9	Having said these things to them, He stayed in Galilee.
JHN.7.10	But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not publicly, but as if, in secret. 
JHN.7.11	So the Jews were seeking Him at the feast and were saying, “Where is He?” 
JHN.7.12	There was much grumbling among the crowds concerning Him; some were saying, “He is a good man”; others were saying, “No, on the contrary, He leads the people astray.” 
JHN.7.13	Yet no one was speaking openly of Him for fear of the Jews.
JHN.7.14	But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and 
JHN.7.15	The Jews then were astonished, saying, “How has this man become learned, having never been educated?” 
JHN.7.16	So Jesus answered them and said, 
JHN.7.20	The crowd answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill You?” 
JHN.7.21	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.7.25	So some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, “Is this not the man whom they are seeking to kill? 
JHN.7.26	Look, He is speaking publicly, and they are saying nothing to Him. The rulers do not really know that this is the Christ, do they? 
JHN.7.27	However, we know where this man is from; but whenever the Christ may come, no one knows where He is from.” 
JHN.7.28	Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, 
JHN.7.30	So they were seeking to seize Him; and no man laid his hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. 
JHN.7.31	But many of the crowd believed in Him; and they were saying, “When the Christ comes, He will not perform more signs than those which this man has, will He?”
JHN.7.32	The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to seize Him. 
JHN.7.33	Therefore Jesus said, 
JHN.7.35	The Jews then said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we will not find Him? He is not intending to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks, is He? 
JHN.7.36	What is this statement that He said, 
JHN.7.37	Now on the last day, the great 
JHN.7.39	But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet 
JHN.7.41	Others were saying, “This is the Christ.” Still others were saying, “Surely the Christ is not going to come from Galilee, is He? 
JHN.7.42	Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?” 
JHN.7.43	So a division occurred in the crowd because of Him. 
JHN.7.44	Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.
JHN.7.45	The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, “Why did you not bring Him?” 
JHN.7.46	The officers answered, “Never has a man spoken the way this man speaks.” 
JHN.7.47	The Pharisees then answered them, “You have not also been led astray, have you? 
JHN.7.48	No one of the rulers or Pharisees has believed in Him, has he? 
JHN.7.49	But this crowd which does not know the Law is accursed.” 
JHN.7.50	Nicodemus (he who came to Him before, being one of them) *said to them, 
JHN.7.51	“Our Law does not judge a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing, does it?” 
JHN.7.52	They answered him, “You are not also from Galilee, are you? Search, and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee.” 
JHN.7.53	[
JHN.8.1	But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 
JHN.8.2	Early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people were coming to Him; and He sat down and 
JHN.8.3	The scribes and the Pharisees *brought a woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the center 
JHN.8.4	they *said to Him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in adultery, in the very act. 
JHN.8.5	Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women; what then do You say?” 
JHN.8.6	They were saying this, testing Him, so that they might have grounds for accusing Him. But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground. 
JHN.8.7	But when they persisted in asking Him, He straightened up, and said to them, 
JHN.8.8	Again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. 
JHN.8.9	When they heard it, they 
JHN.8.10	Straightening up, Jesus said to her, 
JHN.8.11	She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, 
JHN.8.12	Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, 
JHN.8.13	So the Pharisees said to Him, “You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not true.” 
JHN.8.14	Jesus answered and said to them, 
JHN.8.19	So they were saying to Him, “Where is Your Father?” Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.20	These words He spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.
JHN.8.21	Then He said again to them, 
JHN.8.22	So the Jews were saying, “Surely He will not kill Himself, will He, since He says, 
JHN.8.23	And He was saying to them, 
JHN.8.25	So they were saying to Him, “Who are You?” Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.27	They did not realize that He had been speaking to them about the Father. 
JHN.8.28	So Jesus said, 
JHN.8.30	As He spoke these things, many came to believe in Him.
JHN.8.31	So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, 
JHN.8.33	They answered Him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never yet been enslaved to anyone; how is it that You say, 
JHN.8.34	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.8.39	They answered and said to Him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus *said to them, 
JHN.8.41	 They said to Him, “We were not born of fornication; we have one Father: God.” 
JHN.8.42	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.48	The Jews answered and said to Him, “Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?” 
JHN.8.49	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.52	The Jews said to Him, “Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets 
JHN.8.53	Surely You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too; whom do You make Yourself out 
JHN.8.54	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.57	So the Jews said to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?” 
JHN.8.58	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.59	Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple.
JHN.9.1	As He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth. 
JHN.9.2	And His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?” 
JHN.9.3	Jesus answered, 
JHN.9.6	When He had said this, He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and applied the clay to his eyes, 
JHN.9.7	and said to him, 
JHN.9.8	Therefore the neighbors, and those who previously saw him as a beggar, were saying, “Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?” 
JHN.9.9	Others were saying, “This is he,” 
JHN.9.10	So they were saying to him, “How then were your eyes opened?” 
JHN.9.11	He answered, “The man who is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, 
JHN.9.12	They said to him, “Where is He?” He *said, “I do not know.”
JHN.9.13	They *brought to the Pharisees the man who was formerly blind. 
JHN.9.14	Now it was a Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. 
JHN.9.15	Then the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received his sight. And he said to them, “He applied clay to my eyes, and I washed, and I see.” 
JHN.9.16	Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.” But others were saying, “How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?” And there was a division among them. 
JHN.9.17	So they *said to the blind man again, “What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?” And he said, “He is a prophet.”
JHN.9.18	The Jews then did not believe 
JHN.9.19	and questioned them, saying, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?” 
JHN.9.20	His parents answered them and said, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; 
JHN.9.21	but how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself.” 
JHN.9.22	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue. 
JHN.9.23	For this reason his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”
JHN.9.24	So a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, “Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.” 
JHN.9.25	He then answered, “Whether He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.” 
JHN.9.26	So they said to him, “What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?” 
JHN.9.27	He answered them, “I told you already and you did not listen; why do you want to hear 
JHN.9.28	They reviled him and said, “You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. 
JHN.9.29	We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from.” 
JHN.9.30	The man answered and said to them, “Well, here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and 
JHN.9.31	We know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him. 
JHN.9.32	Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind. 
JHN.9.33	If this man were not from God, He could do nothing.” 
JHN.9.34	They answered him, “You were born entirely in sins, and are you teaching us?” So they put him out.
JHN.9.35	Jesus heard that they had put him out, and finding him, He said, 
JHN.9.36	He answered, “Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?” 
JHN.9.37	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.9.38	And he said, “Lord, I believe.” And he worshiped Him. 
JHN.9.39	And Jesus said, 
JHN.9.40	Those of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, “We are not blind too, are we?” 
JHN.9.41	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.10.6	This figure of speech Jesus spoke to them, but they did not understand what those things were which He had been saying to them.
JHN.10.7	So Jesus said to them again, 
JHN.10.19	A division occurred again among the Jews because of these words. 
JHN.10.20	Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?” 
JHN.10.21	Others were saying, “These are not the sayings of one demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can he?”
JHN.10.22	At that time the Feast of the Dedication took place at Jerusalem; 
JHN.10.23	it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of Solomon. 
JHN.10.24	The Jews then gathered around Him, and were saying to Him, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.” 
JHN.10.25	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.31	The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him. 
JHN.10.32	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.33	The Jews answered Him, “For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out 
JHN.10.34	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.39	Therefore they were seeking again to seize Him, and He eluded their grasp.
JHN.10.40	And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He was staying there. 
JHN.10.41	Many came to Him and were saying, “While John performed no sign, yet everything John said about this man was true.” 
JHN.10.42	Many believed in Him there.
JHN.11.1	Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 
JHN.11.2	It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. 
JHN.11.3	So the sisters sent 
JHN.11.4	But when Jesus heard 
JHN.11.5	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 
JHN.11.6	So when He heard that he was sick, He then stayed two days 
JHN.11.7	Then after this He *said to the disciples, 
JHN.11.8	The disciples *said to Him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?” 
JHN.11.9	Jesus answered, 
JHN.11.11	This He said, and after that He *said to them, 
JHN.11.12	The disciples then said to Him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.” 
JHN.11.13	Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He was speaking of literal sleep. 
JHN.11.14	So Jesus then said to them plainly, 
JHN.11.16	Therefore Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to 
JHN.11.17	So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days. 
JHN.11.18	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off; 
JHN.11.19	and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning 
JHN.11.20	Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him, but Mary stayed at the house. 
JHN.11.21	Martha then said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. 
JHN.11.22	Even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.” 
JHN.11.23	Jesus *said to her, 
JHN.11.24	Martha *said to Him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.” 
JHN.11.25	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.11.27	She *said to Him, “Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, 
JHN.11.28	When she had said this, she went away and called Mary her sister, saying secretly, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.” 
JHN.11.29	And when she heard it, she *got up quickly and was coming to Him.
JHN.11.30	Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him. 
JHN.11.31	Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and consoling her, when they saw that Mary got up quickly and went out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. 
JHN.11.32	Therefore, when Mary came where Jesus was, she saw Him, and fell at His feet, saying to Him, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.” 
JHN.11.33	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her 
JHN.11.34	and said, 
JHN.11.35	Jesus wept. 
JHN.11.36	So the Jews were saying, “See how He loved him!” 
JHN.11.37	But some of them said, “Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have kept this man also from dying?”
JHN.11.38	So Jesus, again being deeply moved within, *came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. 
JHN.11.39	Jesus *said, 
JHN.11.40	Jesus *said to her, 
JHN.11.41	So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised His eyes, and said, 
JHN.11.43	When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, 
JHN.11.44	The man who had died came forth, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus *said to them, 
JHN.11.45	Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what He had done, believed in Him. 
JHN.11.46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.
JHN.11.47	Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and were saying, “What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs. 
JHN.11.48	If we let Him 
JHN.11.49	But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all, 
JHN.11.50	nor do you take into account that it is expedient for you that one man die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.” 
JHN.11.51	Now he did not say this on his own initiative, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation, 
JHN.11.52	and not for the nation only, but in order that He might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. 
JHN.11.53	So from that day on they planned together to kill Him.
JHN.11.54	Therefore Jesus no longer continued to walk publicly among the Jews, but went away from there to the country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there He stayed with the disciples.
JHN.11.55	Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover to purify themselves. 
JHN.11.56	So they were seeking for Jesus, and were saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think; that He will not come to the feast at all?” 
JHN.11.57	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he was to report it, so that they might seize Him.
JHN.12.1	Jesus, therefore, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.2	So they made Him a supper there, and Martha was serving; but Lazarus was one of those reclining 
JHN.12.3	Mary then took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. 
JHN.12.4	But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, who was intending to betray Him, *said, 
JHN.12.5	“Why was this perfume not sold for 
JHN.12.6	Now he said this, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box, he used to pilfer what was put into it. 
JHN.12.7	Therefore Jesus said, 
JHN.12.9	The large crowd of the Jews then learned that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.10	But the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also; 
JHN.12.11	because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and were believing in Jesus.
JHN.12.12	On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
JHN.12.13	took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and 
JHN.12.14	Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written, 
JHN.12.15	“F
JHN.12.16	These things His disciples did not understand at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and that they had done these things to Him. 
JHN.12.17	So the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, continued to testify 
JHN.12.18	For this reason also the people went and met Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign. 
JHN.12.19	So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are not doing any good; look, the world has gone after Him.”
JHN.12.20	Now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast; 
JHN.12.21	these then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and 
JHN.12.22	Philip *came and *told Andrew; Andrew and Philip *came and *told Jesus. 
JHN.12.23	And Jesus *answered them, saying, 
JHN.12.28	 Then a voice came out of heaven: “I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.” 
JHN.12.29	So the crowd 
JHN.12.30	Jesus answered and said, 
JHN.12.33	But He was saying this to indicate the kind of death by which He was to die. 
JHN.12.34	The crowd then answered Him, “We have heard out of the Law that the Christ is to remain forever; and how can You say, 
JHN.12.35	So Jesus said to them, 
JHN.12.37	But though He had performed so many signs before them, 
JHN.12.38	 to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke: “L
JHN.12.39	For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again, 
JHN.12.40	“H
JHN.12.41	These things Isaiah said because he saw His glory, and he spoke of Him. 
JHN.12.42	Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing 
JHN.12.43	for they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God.
JHN.12.44	And Jesus cried out and said, 
JHN.13.1	Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that His hour had come that He would depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end. 
JHN.13.2	During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, 
JHN.13.3	 knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come forth from God and was going back to God, 
JHN.13.4	*got up from supper, and *laid aside His garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself.
JHN.13.5	Then He *poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded. 
JHN.13.6	So He *came to Simon Peter. He *said to Him, “Lord, do You wash my feet?” 
JHN.13.7	Jesus answered and said to him, 
JHN.13.8	Peter *said to Him, “Never shall You wash my feet!” Jesus answered him, 
JHN.13.9	Simon Peter *said to Him, “Lord, 
JHN.13.10	Jesus *said to him, 
JHN.13.11	For He knew the one who was betraying Him; for this reason He said, 
JHN.13.12	So when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments and reclined 
JHN.13.21	When Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit, and testified and said, 
JHN.13.22	The disciples 
JHN.13.23	There was reclining on Jesus’ bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved. 
JHN.13.24	So Simon Peter *gestured to him, and *said to him, “Tell 
JHN.13.25	He, leaning back thus on Jesus’ bosom, *said to Him, “Lord, who is it?” 
JHN.13.26	Jesus then *answered, 
JHN.13.27	After the morsel, Satan then entered into him. Therefore Jesus *said to him, 
JHN.13.28	Now no one of those reclining 
JHN.13.29	For some were supposing, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, “Buy the things we have need of for the feast”; or else, that he should give something to the poor. 
JHN.13.30	So after receiving the morsel he went out immediately; and it was night.
JHN.13.31	Therefore when he had gone out, Jesus *said, 
JHN.13.36	Simon Peter *said to Him, “Lord, where are You going?” Jesus answered, 
JHN.13.37	Peter *said to Him, “Lord, why can I not follow You right now? I will lay down my life for You.” 
JHN.13.38	Jesus *answered, 
JHN.14.5	Thomas *said to Him, “Lord, we do not know where You are going, how do we know the way?” 
JHN.14.6	Jesus *said to him, 
JHN.14.8	Philip *said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.” 
JHN.14.9	Jesus *said to him, 
JHN.14.22	Judas (not Iscariot) *said to Him, “Lord, what then has happened that You are going to disclose Yourself to us and not to the world?” 
JHN.14.23	Jesus answered and said to him, 
JHN.16.17	 of His disciples then said to one another, “What is this thing He is telling us, 
JHN.16.18	So they were saying, “What is this that He says, 
JHN.16.19	Jesus knew that they wished to question Him, and He said to them, 
JHN.16.29	His disciples *said, “Lo, now You are speaking plainly and are not using a figure of speech. 
JHN.16.30	Now we know that You know all things, and have no need for anyone to question You; by this we believe that You came from God.” 
JHN.16.31	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.17.1	Jesus spoke these things; and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, 
JHN.18.1	When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His disciples over the ravine of the Kidron, where there was a garden, in which He entered with His disciples. 
JHN.18.2	Now Judas also, who was betraying Him, knew the place, for Jesus had often met there with His disciples. 
JHN.18.3	Judas then, having received the 
JHN.18.4	So Jesus, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and *said to them, 
JHN.18.5	They answered Him, “Jesus the Nazarene.” He *said to them, 
JHN.18.6	So when He said to them, 
JHN.18.7	Therefore He again asked them, 
JHN.18.8	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.9	to fulfill the word which He spoke, 
JHN.18.10	Simon Peter then, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s slave, and cut off his right ear; and the slave’s name was Malchus. 
JHN.18.11	So Jesus said to Peter, 
JHN.18.12	So the 
JHN.18.13	and led Him to Annas first; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. 
JHN.18.14	Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people.
JHN.18.15	Simon Peter was following Jesus, and 
JHN.18.16	but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in. 
JHN.18.17	Then the slave-girl who kept the door *said to Peter, “You are not also 
JHN.18.18	Now the slaves and the officers were standing 
JHN.18.19	The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples, and about His teaching. 
JHN.18.20	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.18.22	When He had said this, one of the officers standing nearby struck Jesus, saying, “Is that the way You answer the high priest?” 
JHN.18.23	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.18.24	So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
JHN.18.25	Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, “You are not also 
JHN.18.26	One of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the one whose ear Peter cut off, *said, “Did I not see you in the garden with Him?” 
JHN.18.27	Peter then denied 
JHN.18.28	Then they *led Jesus from Caiaphas into the 
JHN.18.29	Therefore Pilate went out to them and *said, “What accusation do you bring against this Man?” 
JHN.18.30	They answered and said to him, “If this Man were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him to you.” 
JHN.18.31	So Pilate said to them, “Take Him yourselves, and judge Him according to your law.” The Jews said to him, “We are not permitted to put anyone to death,” 
JHN.18.32	to fulfill the word of Jesus which He spoke, signifying by what kind of death He was about to die.
JHN.18.33	Therefore Pilate entered again into the Praetorium, and summoned Jesus and said to Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” 
JHN.18.34	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.35	Pilate answered, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered You to me; what have You done?” 
JHN.18.36	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.37	Therefore Pilate said to Him, “So You are a king?” Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.38	Pilate *said to Him, “What is truth?”
JHN.18.39	But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover; do you wish then that I release for you the King of the Jews?” 
JHN.18.40	So they cried out again, saying, “Not this Man, but Barabbas.” Now Barabbas was a robber.
JHN.19.1	Pilate then took Jesus and scourged Him. 
JHN.19.2	And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and put a purple robe on Him; 
JHN.19.3	and they 
JHN.19.4	Pilate came out again and *said to them, “Behold, I am bringing Him out to you so that you may know that I find no guilt in Him.” 
JHN.19.5	Jesus then came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. 
JHN.19.6	So when the chief priests and the officers saw Him, they cried out saying, “Crucify, crucify!” Pilate *said to them, “Take Him yourselves and crucify Him, for I find no guilt in Him.” 
JHN.19.7	The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and by that law He ought to die because He made Himself out 
JHN.19.8	Therefore when Pilate heard this statement, he was 
JHN.19.9	and he entered into the 
JHN.19.10	So Pilate *said to Him, “You do not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You, and I have authority to crucify You?” 
JHN.19.11	Jesus answered, 
JHN.19.12	As a result of this Pilate made efforts to release Him, but the Jews cried out saying, “If you release this Man, you are no friend of Caesar; everyone who makes himself out 
JHN.19.13	Therefore when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 
JHN.19.14	Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the 
JHN.19.15	So they cried out, “Away with 
JHN.19.16	So he then handed Him over to them to be crucified.
JHN.19.17	They took Jesus, therefore, and He went out, bearing His own cross, to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha. 
JHN.19.18	There they crucified Him, and with Him two other men, one on either side, and Jesus in between. 
JHN.19.19	Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It was written, “JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” 
JHN.19.20	Therefore many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin 
JHN.19.21	So the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews’; but that He said, ‘I am King of the Jews.’ ” 
JHN.19.22	Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.”
JHN.19.23	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer garments and made four parts, a part to every soldier and 
JHN.19.24	So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, 
JHN.19.25	Therefore the soldiers did these things.
JHN.19.26	When Jesus then saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He *said to His mother, 
JHN.19.27	Then He *said to the disciple, 
JHN.19.28	After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been accomplished, to fulfill the Scripture, *said, 
JHN.19.29	A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon 
JHN.19.30	Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, 
JHN.19.31	Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and 
JHN.19.32	So the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with Him; 
JHN.19.33	but coming to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. 
JHN.19.34	But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. 
JHN.19.35	And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe. 
JHN.19.36	For these things came to pass to fulfill the Scripture, “N
JHN.19.37	And again another Scripture says, “T
JHN.19.38	After these things Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a secret 
JHN.19.39	Nicodemus, who had first come to Him by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds 
JHN.19.40	So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. 
JHN.19.41	Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. 
JHN.19.42	Therefore because of the Jewish day of preparation, since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
JHN.20.1	Now on the first 
JHN.20.2	So she *ran and *came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and *said to them, “They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.” 
JHN.20.3	So Peter and the other disciple went forth, and they were going to the tomb. 
JHN.20.4	The two were running together; and the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came to the tomb first; 
JHN.20.5	and stooping and looking in, he *saw the linen wrappings lying 
JHN.20.6	And so Simon Peter also *came, following him, and entered the tomb; and he *saw the linen wrappings lying 
JHN.20.7	and the face-cloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen wrappings, but rolled up in a place by itself. 
JHN.20.8	So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb then also entered, and he saw and believed. 
JHN.20.9	For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. 
JHN.20.10	So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
JHN.20.11	But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping; and so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb; 
JHN.20.12	and she *saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been lying. 
JHN.20.13	And they *said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She *said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.” 
JHN.20.14	When she had said this, she turned around and *saw Jesus standing 
JHN.20.15	Jesus *said to her, 
JHN.20.16	Jesus *said to her, 
JHN.20.17	Jesus *said to her, 
JHN.20.18	Mary Magdalene *came, announcing to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and 
JHN.20.19	So when it was evening on that day, the first 
JHN.20.20	And when He had said this, He showed them both His hands and His side. The disciples then rejoiced when they saw the Lord. 
JHN.20.21	So Jesus said to them again, 
JHN.20.22	And when He had said this, He breathed on them and *said to them, 
JHN.20.24	But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 
JHN.20.25	So the other disciples were saying to him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.”
JHN.20.26	After eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus *came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and said, 
JHN.20.27	Then He *said to Thomas, 
JHN.20.28	Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!” 
JHN.20.29	Jesus *said to him, 
JHN.20.30	Therefore many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; 
JHN.20.31	but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His name.
JHN.21.1	After these things Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and He manifested 
JHN.21.2	Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the 
JHN.21.3	Simon Peter *said to them, “I am going fishing.” They *said to him, “We will also come with you.” They went out and got into the boat; and that night they caught nothing.
JHN.21.4	But when the day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 
JHN.21.5	So Jesus *said to them, 
JHN.21.6	And He said to them, 
JHN.21.7	Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved *said to Peter, “It is the Lord.” So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment on (for he was stripped 
JHN.21.8	But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about one hundred yards away, dragging the net 
JHN.21.9	So when they got out on the land, they *saw a charcoal fire 
JHN.21.10	Jesus *said to them, 
JHN.21.11	Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.
JHN.21.12	Jesus *said to them, 
JHN.21.13	Jesus *came and *took the bread and *gave 
JHN.21.14	This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after He was raised from the dead.
JHN.21.15	So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus *said to Simon Peter, 
JHN.21.16	He *said to him again a second time, 
JHN.21.17	He *said to him the third time, 
JHN.21.19	Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He *said to him, 
JHN.21.20	Peter, turning around, *saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following 
JHN.21.21	So Peter seeing him *said to Jesus, “Lord, and what about this man?” 
JHN.21.22	Jesus *said to him, 
JHN.21.23	Therefore this saying went out among the brethren that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but 
JHN.21.24	This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true.
JHN.21.25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they *were written in detail, I suppose that even the world itself *would not contain the books that *would be written.
ACT.1.1	The first account I composed, Theophilus, about all that Jesus began to do and teach, 
ACT.1.2	until the day when He was taken up 
ACT.1.3	To these He also presented Himself alive after His suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over 
ACT.1.4	Gathering them together, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, 
ACT.1.6	So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, “Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?” 
ACT.1.7	He said to them, 
ACT.1.9	And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. 
ACT.1.10	And as they were gazing intently into the sky while He was going, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them. 
ACT.1.11	They also said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.”
ACT.1.12	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away. 
ACT.1.13	When they had entered 
ACT.1.14	These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to prayer, along with 
ACT.1.15	At this time Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren (a gathering of about one hundred and twenty persons was there together), and said, 
ACT.1.16	“Brethren, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus. 
ACT.1.17	For he was counted among us and received his share in this ministry.” 
ACT.1.18	(Now this man acquired a field with the price of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out. 
ACT.1.19	And it became known to all who were living in Jerusalem; so that in their own language that field was called Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) 
ACT.1.20	“For it is written in the book of Psalms,
ACT.1.20	‘L
ACT.1.20	A
ACT.1.20	and,
ACT.1.20	‘L
ACT.1.21	Therefore it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us— 
ACT.1.22	beginning with the baptism of John until the day that He was taken up from us—one of these 
ACT.1.23	So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was also called Justus), and Matthias. 
ACT.1.24	And they prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two You have chosen 
ACT.1.25	to occupy this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.” 
ACT.1.26	And they drew lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.
ACT.2.1	When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. 
ACT.2.2	And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. 
ACT.2.3	And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one of them. 
ACT.2.4	And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance.
ACT.2.5	Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven. 
ACT.2.6	And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together, and were bewildered because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language. 
ACT.2.7	They were amazed and astonished, saying, “Why, are not all these who are speaking Galileans? 
ACT.2.8	And how is it that we each hear 
ACT.2.9	Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 
ACT.2.10	Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and 
ACT.2.11	Cretans and Arabs—we hear them in our 
ACT.2.12	And they all continued in amazement and great perplexity, saying to one another, “What does this mean?” 
ACT.2.13	But others were mocking and saying, “They are full of sweet wine.”
ACT.2.14	But Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them: “Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words. 
ACT.2.15	For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is 
ACT.2.16	but this is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel:

ACT.2.23	this 
ACT.2.24	But God raised Him up again, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in its power. 
ACT.2.25	For David says of Him,

ACT.2.29	“Brethren, I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. 
ACT.2.30	And so, because he was a prophet and knew that G
ACT.2.31	he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of 
ACT.2.32	This Jesus God raised up again, to which we are all witnesses. 
ACT.2.33	Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured forth this which you both see and hear. 
ACT.2.34	For it was not David who ascended into heaven, but he himself says:

ACT.2.34	“S
ACT.2.35	U
ACT.2.36	Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified.”
ACT.2.37	Now when they heard 
ACT.2.38	Peter 
ACT.2.39	For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself.” 
ACT.2.40	And with many other words he solemnly testified and kept on exhorting them, saying, “Be saved from this perverse generation!” 
ACT.2.41	So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and that day there were added about three thousand 
ACT.2.42	They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
ACT.2.43	Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe; and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles. 
ACT.2.44	And all those who had believed 
ACT.2.45	and they 
ACT.2.46	Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart, 
ACT.2.47	praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.
ACT.3.1	Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the 
ACT.3.2	And a man who had been lame from his mother’s womb was being carried along, whom they used to set down every day at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, in order to beg 
ACT.3.3	When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he 
ACT.3.4	But Peter, along with John, fixed his gaze on him and said, “Look at us!” 
ACT.3.5	And he 
ACT.3.6	But Peter said, “I do not possess silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene—walk!” 
ACT.3.7	And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened. 
ACT.3.8	With a leap he stood upright and 
ACT.3.9	And all the people saw him walking and praising God; 
ACT.3.10	and they were taking note of him as being the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to 
ACT.3.11	While he was clinging to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them at the so-called portico of Solomon, full of amazement. 
ACT.3.12	But when Peter saw 
ACT.3.13	The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus, 
ACT.3.14	But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, 
ACT.3.15	but put to death the Prince of life, 
ACT.3.16	And on the basis of faith in His name, 
ACT.3.17	“And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did also. 
ACT.3.18	But the things which God announced beforehand by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled. 
ACT.3.19	Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord; 
ACT.3.20	and that He may send Jesus, the Christ appointed for you, 
ACT.3.21	whom heaven must receive until 
ACT.3.22	Moses said, ‘T
ACT.3.23	And it will be that every soul that does not heed that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.’ 
ACT.3.24	And likewise, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and 
ACT.3.25	It is you who are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘A
ACT.3.26	For you first, God raised up His Servant and sent Him to bless you by turning every one 
ACT.4.1	As they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple 
ACT.4.2	being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 
ACT.4.3	And they laid hands on them and put them in jail until the next day, for it was already evening. 
ACT.4.4	But many of those who had heard the message believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.
ACT.4.5	On the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem; 
ACT.4.6	and Annas the high priest 
ACT.4.7	When they had placed them in the center, they 
ACT.4.8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers and elders of the people, 
ACT.4.9	if we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man, as to how this man has been made well, 
ACT.4.10	let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead—by this 
ACT.4.11	He is the 
ACT.4.12	And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved.”
ACT.4.13	Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were amazed, and 
ACT.4.14	And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply. 
ACT.4.15	But when they had ordered them to leave the Council, they 
ACT.4.16	saying, “What shall we do with these men? For the fact that a noteworthy miracle has taken place through them is apparent to all who live in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. 
ACT.4.17	But so that it will not spread any further among the people, let us warn them to speak no longer to any man in this name.” 
ACT.4.18	And when they had summoned them, they commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. 
ACT.4.19	But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge; 
ACT.4.20	for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.” 
ACT.4.21	When they had threatened them further, they let them go (finding no basis on which to punish them) on account of the people, because they were all glorifying God for what had happened; 
ACT.4.22	for the man was more than forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed.
ACT.4.23	When they had been released, they went to their own 
ACT.4.24	And when they heard 
ACT.4.25	who by the Holy Spirit, 
ACT.4.25	‘W
ACT.4.25	A
ACT.4.26	T
ACT.4.26	A
ACT.4.26	A
ACT.4.27	For truly in this city there were gathered together against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, 
ACT.4.28	to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose predestined to occur. 
ACT.4.29	And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and grant that Your bond-servants may speak Your word with all confidence, 
ACT.4.30	while You extend Your hand to heal, and signs and wonders take place through the name of Your holy servant Jesus.” 
ACT.4.31	And when they had prayed, the place where they had gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and 
ACT.4.32	And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul; and not one 
ACT.4.33	And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all. 
ACT.4.34	For there was not a needy person among them, for all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales 
ACT.4.35	and lay them at the apostles’ feet, and they would be distributed to each as any had need.
ACT.4.36	Now Joseph, a Levite of Cyprian birth, who was also called Barnabas by the apostles (which translated means Son of Encouragement), 
ACT.4.37	and who owned a tract of land, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
ACT.5.1	But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property, 
ACT.5.2	and kept back 
ACT.5.3	But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back 
ACT.5.4	While it remained 
ACT.5.5	And as he heard these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last; and great fear came over all who heard of it. 
ACT.5.6	The young men got up and covered him up, and after carrying him out, they buried him.
ACT.5.7	Now there elapsed an interval of about three hours, and his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 
ACT.5.8	And Peter responded to her, “Tell me whether you sold the land for such and such a price?” And she said, “Yes, that was the price.” 
ACT.5.9	Then Peter 
ACT.5.10	And immediately she fell at his feet and breathed her last, and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 
ACT.5.11	And great fear came over the whole church, and over all who heard of these things.
ACT.5.12	At the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were taking place among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s portico. 
ACT.5.13	But none of the rest dared to associate with them; however, the people held them in high esteem. 
ACT.5.14	And all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were constantly added to 
ACT.5.15	to such an extent that they even carried the sick out into the streets and laid them on cots and pallets, so that when Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on any one of them. 
ACT.5.16	Also the people from the cities in the vicinity of Jerusalem were coming together, bringing people who were sick 
ACT.5.17	But the high priest rose up, along with all his associates (that is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy. 
ACT.5.18	They laid hands on the apostles and put them in a public jail. 
ACT.5.19	But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the gates of the prison, and taking them out he said, 
ACT.5.20	“Go, stand and speak to the people in the temple the whole message of this Life.” 
ACT.5.21	Upon hearing 
ACT.5.22	But the officers who came did not find them in the prison; and they returned and reported back, 
ACT.5.23	saying, “We found the prison house locked quite securely and the guards standing at the doors; but when we had opened up, we found no one inside.” 
ACT.5.24	Now when the captain of the temple 
ACT.5.25	But someone came and reported to them, “The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!” 
ACT.5.26	Then the captain went along with the officers and 
ACT.5.27	When they had brought them, they stood them before the Council. The high priest questioned them, 
ACT.5.28	saying, “We gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.” 
ACT.5.29	But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men. 
ACT.5.30	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you had put to death by hanging Him on a cross. 
ACT.5.31	He is the one whom God exalted to His right hand as a Prince and a Savior, to grant repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. 
ACT.5.32	And we are witnesses 
ACT.5.33	But when they heard this, they were cut to the quick and intended to kill them. 
ACT.5.34	But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, respected by all the people, stood up in the Council and gave orders to put the men outside for a short time. 
ACT.5.35	And he said to them, “Men of Israel, take care what you propose to do with these men. 
ACT.5.36	For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a group of about four hundred men joined up with him. But he was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing. 
ACT.5.37	After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census and drew away 
ACT.5.38	So in the present case, I say to you, stay away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or action is of men, it will be overthrown; 
ACT.5.39	but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them; or else you may even be found fighting against God.”
ACT.5.40	They took his advice; and after calling the apostles in, they flogged them and ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and 
ACT.5.41	So they went on their way from the presence of the Council, rejoicing that they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for 
ACT.5.42	And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they kept right on teaching and preaching Jesus 
ACT.6.1	Now at this time while the disciples were increasing 
ACT.6.2	So the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples and said, “It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables. 
ACT.6.3	Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task. 
ACT.6.4	But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” 
ACT.6.5	The statement found approval with the whole congregation; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas and Nicolas, a 
ACT.6.6	And these they brought before the apostles; and after praying, they laid their hands on them.
ACT.6.7	The word of God kept on spreading; and the number of the disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith.
ACT.6.8	And Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people. 
ACT.6.9	But some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen, 
ACT.6.10	But they were unable to cope with the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking. 
ACT.6.11	Then they secretly induced men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and 
ACT.6.12	And they stirred up the people, the elders and the scribes, and they came up to him and dragged him away and brought him before the Council. 
ACT.6.13	They put forward false witnesses who said, “This man incessantly speaks against this holy place and the Law; 
ACT.6.14	for we have heard him say that this Nazarene, Jesus, will destroy this place and alter the customs which Moses handed down to us.” 
ACT.6.15	And fixing their gaze on him, all who were sitting in the Council saw his face like the face of an angel.
ACT.7.1	The high priest said, “Are these things so?”
ACT.7.2	And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, 
ACT.7.3	and said to him, ‘L
ACT.7.4	Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. From there, after his father died, 
ACT.7.5	But He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot of ground, and 
ACT.7.6	But God spoke to this effect, that his

ACT.7.8	And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so 
ACT.7.9	“The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt. 
ACT.7.10	and rescued him from all his afflictions, and granted him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household.
ACT.7.11	“Now a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction 
ACT.7.12	But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers 
ACT.7.13	On the second

ACT.7.15	And Jacob went down to Egypt and 
ACT.7.16	 they were removed to Shechem and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
ACT.7.17	“But as the time of the promise was approaching which God had assured to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt, 
ACT.7.18	until 
ACT.7.19	It was he who took shrewd advantage of our race and mistreated our fathers so that they would expose their infants and they would not survive. 
ACT.7.20	It was at this time that Moses was born; and he was lovely in the sight of God, and he was nurtured three months in his father’s home. 
ACT.7.21	And after he had been set outside, Pharaoh’s daughter took him away and nurtured him as her own son. 
ACT.7.22	Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and he was a man of power in words and deeds. 
ACT.7.23	But when he was approaching the age of forty, it entered his mind to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel. 
ACT.7.24	And when he saw one 
ACT.7.25	And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance through him, but they did not understand. 
ACT.7.26	On the following day he appeared to them as they were fighting together, and he tried to reconcile them in peace, saying, ‘Men, you are brethren, why do you injure one another?’ 
ACT.7.27	But the one who was injuring his neighbor pushed him away, saying, ‘W

ACT.7.41	At that time they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands. 
ACT.7.42	But God turned away and delivered them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, ‘I

ACT.7.44	“Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, just as He who spoke to Moses directed

ACT.7.52	Which one of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They killed those who had previously announced the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become; 
ACT.7.53	you who received the law as ordained by angels, and 
ACT.7.54	Now when they heard this, they were cut to the quick, and they 
ACT.7.55	But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; 
ACT.7.56	and he said, “Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.” 
ACT.7.57	But they cried out with a loud voice, and covered their ears and rushed at him with one impulse. 
ACT.7.58	When they had driven him out of the city, they 
ACT.7.59	They went on stoning Stephen as he called on 
ACT.7.60	Then falling on his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them!” Having said this, he fell asleep.
ACT.8.1	Saul was in hearty agreement with putting him to death.
ACT.8.2	 devout men buried Stephen, and made loud lamentation over him. 
ACT.8.3	But Saul 
ACT.8.4	Therefore, those who had been scattered went about preaching the word. 
ACT.8.5	Philip went down to the city of Samaria and 
ACT.8.6	The crowds with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip, as they heard and saw the signs which he was performing. 
ACT.8.7	For 
ACT.8.8	So there was much rejoicing in that city.
ACT.8.9	Now there was a man named Simon, who formerly was practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great; 
ACT.8.10	and they all, from smallest to greatest, were giving attention to him, saying, “This man is what is called the Great Power of God.” 
ACT.8.11	And they were giving him attention because he had for a long time astonished them with his magic arts. 
ACT.8.12	But when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, men and women alike. 
ACT.8.13	Even Simon himself believed; and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip, and as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, he was constantly amazed.
ACT.8.14	Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John, 
ACT.8.15	who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.8.16	For He had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.8.17	Then they 
ACT.8.18	Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money, 
ACT.8.19	saying, “Give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.” 
ACT.8.20	But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! 
ACT.8.21	You have no part or portion in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. 
ACT.8.22	Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that, if possible, the intention of your heart may be forgiven you. 
ACT.8.23	For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.” 
ACT.8.24	But Simon answered and said, “Pray to the Lord for me yourselves, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.”
ACT.8.25	So, when they had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, and were preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
ACT.8.26	But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying, “Get up and go south to the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a desert 
ACT.8.27	So he got up and went; and there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship, 
ACT.8.28	and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah. 
ACT.8.29	Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go up and join this chariot.” 
ACT.8.30	Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, “Do you understand what you are reading?” 
ACT.8.31	And he said, “Well, how could I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. 
ACT.8.32	Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this:
ACT.8.32	“H
ACT.8.32	A
ACT.8.32	S
ACT.8.33	I
ACT.8.33	W
ACT.8.33	F
ACT.8.34	The eunuch answered Philip and said, “Please 
ACT.8.35	Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he preached Jesus to him. 
ACT.8.36	As they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch *said, “Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?” 
ACT.8.37	[
ACT.8.38	And he ordered the chariot to stop; and they both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch, and he baptized him. 
ACT.8.39	When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch no longer saw him, but went on his way rejoicing. 
ACT.8.40	But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the cities until he came to Caesarea.
ACT.9.1	Now Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest, 
ACT.9.2	and asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. 
ACT.9.3	As he was traveling, it happened that he was approaching Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; 
ACT.9.4	and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, 
ACT.9.5	And he said, “Who are You, Lord?” And He 
ACT.9.7	The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. 
ACT.9.8	Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; and leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus. 
ACT.9.9	And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
ACT.9.10	Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, 
ACT.9.11	And the Lord 
ACT.9.13	But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he did to Your saints at Jerusalem; 
ACT.9.14	and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your name.” 
ACT.9.15	But the Lord said to him, 
ACT.9.17	So Ananias departed and entered the house, and after laying his hands on him said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” 
ACT.9.18	And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he regained his sight, and he got up and was baptized; 
ACT.9.19	and he took food and was strengthened.
ACT.9.20	and immediately he 
ACT.9.21	All those hearing him continued to be amazed, and were saying, “Is this not he who in Jerusalem destroyed those who called on this name, and 
ACT.9.22	But Saul kept increasing in strength and confounding the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this 
ACT.9.23	When many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted together to do away with him, 
ACT.9.24	but their plot became known to Saul. They were also watching the gates day and night so that they might put him to death; 
ACT.9.25	but his disciples took him by night and let him down through 
ACT.9.26	When he came to Jerusalem, he was trying to associate with the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. 
ACT.9.27	But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had talked to him, and how at Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus. 
ACT.9.28	And he was with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord. 
ACT.9.29	And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic 
ACT.9.30	But when the brethren learned 
ACT.9.31	So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase.
ACT.9.32	Now as Peter was traveling through all 
ACT.9.33	There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years, for he was paralyzed. 
ACT.9.34	Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; get up and make your bed.” Immediately he got up. 
ACT.9.35	And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
ACT.9.36	Now in Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which translated 
ACT.9.37	And it happened at that time that she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her body, they laid it in an upper room. 
ACT.9.38	Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him, “Do not delay in coming to us.” 
ACT.9.39	So Peter arose and went with them. When he arrived, they brought him into the upper room; and all the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing all the 
ACT.9.40	But Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed, and turning to the body, he said, “Tabitha, arise.” And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 
ACT.9.41	And he gave her his hand and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. 
ACT.9.42	It became known all over Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. 
ACT.9.43	And Peter stayed many days in Joppa with a tanner 
ACT.10.1	Now 
ACT.10.2	a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, and gave many 
ACT.10.3	About the 
ACT.10.4	And fixing his gaze on him and being much alarmed, he said, “What is it, Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and 
ACT.10.5	Now dispatch 
ACT.10.6	he is staying with a tanner 
ACT.10.7	When the angel who was speaking to him had left, he summoned two of his servants and a devout soldier of those who were his personal attendants, 
ACT.10.8	and after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
ACT.10.9	On the next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the 
ACT.10.10	But he became hungry and was desiring to eat; but while they were making preparations, he fell into a trance; 
ACT.10.11	and he *saw the sky opened up, and an 
ACT.10.12	and there were in it all 
ACT.10.13	A voice came to him, “Get up, Peter, kill and eat!” 
ACT.10.14	But Peter said, “By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unholy and unclean.” 
ACT.10.15	Again a voice 
ACT.10.16	This happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into the sky.
ACT.10.17	Now while Peter was greatly perplexed in mind as to what the vision which he had seen might be, behold, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having asked directions for Simon’s house, appeared at the gate; 
ACT.10.18	and calling out, they were asking whether Simon, who was also called Peter, was staying there. 
ACT.10.19	While Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for you. 
ACT.10.20	But get up, go downstairs and accompany them without misgivings, for I have sent them Myself.” 
ACT.10.21	Peter went down to the men and said, “Behold, I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for which you have come?” 
ACT.10.22	They said, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man well spoken of by the entire nation of the Jews, was 
ACT.10.23	So he invited them in and gave them lodging.
ACT.10.24	On the following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends. 
ACT.10.25	When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell at his feet and worshiped 
ACT.10.26	But Peter raised him up, saying, “Stand up; I too am 
ACT.10.27	As he talked with him, he entered and *found many people assembled. 
ACT.10.28	And he said to them, “You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a man who is a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him; and 
ACT.10.29	That is why I came without even raising any objection when I was sent for. So I ask for what reason you have sent for me.”
ACT.10.30	Cornelius said, “Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the 
ACT.10.31	and he *said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. 
ACT.10.32	Therefore send to Joppa and invite Simon, who is also called Peter, to come to you; he is staying at the house of Simon 
ACT.10.33	So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here present before God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.”
ACT.10.34	Opening his mouth, Peter said:
ACT.10.34	“
ACT.10.35	but in every nation the man who fears Him and does what is right is welcome to Him. 
ACT.10.36	The word which He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all)— 
ACT.10.37	you yourselves know the thing which took place throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed. 
ACT.10.38	 Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and 
ACT.10.39	We are witnesses of all the things He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They also put Him to death by hanging Him on a cross. 
ACT.10.40	God raised Him up on the third day and granted that He become visible, 
ACT.10.41	not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God, 
ACT.10.42	And He ordered us to preach to the people, and solemnly to testify that this is the One who has been appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead. 
ACT.10.43	Of Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.”
ACT.10.44	While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message. 
ACT.10.45	All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. 
ACT.10.46	For they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God. Then Peter answered, 
ACT.10.47	“Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we 
ACT.10.48	And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.
ACT.11.1	Now the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. 
ACT.11.2	And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those who were circumcised took issue with him, 
ACT.11.3	saying, “You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.” 
ACT.11.4	But Peter began 
ACT.11.5	“I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object coming down like a great sheet lowered by four corners from the sky; and it came right down to me, 
ACT.11.6	and when I had fixed my gaze on it and was observing it I saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the 
ACT.11.7	I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter; kill and eat.’ 
ACT.11.8	But I said, ‘By no means, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’ 
ACT.11.9	But a voice from heaven answered a second time, ‘What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy.’ 
ACT.11.10	This happened three times, and everything was drawn back up into the sky. 
ACT.11.11	And behold, at that moment three men appeared at the house in which we were 
ACT.11.12	The Spirit told me to go with them without misgivings. These six brethren also went with me and we entered the man’s house. 
ACT.11.13	And he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and have Simon, who is also called Peter, brought here; 
ACT.11.14	and he will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.’ 
ACT.11.15	And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as 
ACT.11.16	And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, 
ACT.11.17	Therefore if God gave to them the same gift as 
ACT.11.18	When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying, “Well then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance 
ACT.11.19	So then those who were scattered because of the persecution that occurred in connection with Stephen made their way to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews alone. 
ACT.11.20	But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and 
ACT.11.21	And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord. 
ACT.11.22	The news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch. 
ACT.11.23	Then when he arrived and witnessed the grace of God, he rejoiced and 
ACT.11.24	for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And considerable numbers were brought to the Lord. 
ACT.11.25	And he left for Tarsus to look for Saul; 
ACT.11.26	and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers; and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
ACT.11.27	Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
ACT.11.28	One of them named Agabus stood up and 
ACT.11.29	And in the proportion that any of the disciples had means, each of them determined to send 
ACT.11.30	And this they did, sending it in charge of Barnabas and Saul to the elders.
ACT.12.1	Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church in order to mistreat them. 
ACT.12.2	And he had James the brother of John put to death with a sword. 
ACT.12.3	When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. Now it was during the days of Unleavened Bread. 
ACT.12.4	When he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out before the people. 
ACT.12.5	So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer for him was being made fervently by the church to God.
ACT.12.6	On the very night when Herod was about to bring him forward, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards in front of the door were watching over the prison. 
ACT.12.7	And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter’s side and woke him up, saying, “Get up quickly.” And his chains fell off his hands. 
ACT.12.8	And the angel said to him, “Gird yourself and put on your sandals.” And he did so. And he *said to him, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.” 
ACT.12.9	And he went out and continued to follow, and he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. 
ACT.12.10	When they had passed the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened for them by itself; and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel departed from him. 
ACT.12.11	When Peter came to himself, he said, “Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.” 
ACT.12.12	And when he realized 
ACT.12.13	When he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer. 
ACT.12.14	When she recognized Peter’s voice, because of her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate. 
ACT.12.15	They said to her, “You are out of your mind!” But she kept insisting that it was so. They kept saying, “It is his angel.” 
ACT.12.16	But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened 
ACT.12.17	But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. And he said, “Report these things to James and the brethren.” Then he left and went to another place.
ACT.12.18	Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers 
ACT.12.19	When Herod had searched for him and had not found him, he examined the guards and ordered that they be led away 
ACT.12.20	Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and with one accord they came to him, and having won over Blastus the king’s chamberlain, they were asking for peace, because their country was fed by the king’s country. 
ACT.12.21	On an appointed day Herod, having put on his royal apparel, took his seat on the rostrum and 
ACT.12.22	The people kept crying out, “The voice of a god and not of a man!” 
ACT.12.23	And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.
ACT.12.24	But the word of the Lord continued to grow and to be multiplied.
ACT.12.25	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission, taking along with 
ACT.13.1	Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was 
ACT.13.2	While they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” 
ACT.13.3	Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
ACT.13.4	So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus. 
ACT.13.5	When they reached Salamis, they 
ACT.13.6	When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus, 
ACT.13.7	who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. 
ACT.13.8	But Elymas the magician (for so his name is translated) was opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. 
ACT.13.9	But Saul, who was also 
ACT.13.10	and said, “You who are full of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the Lord? 
ACT.13.11	Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a time.” And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking those who would lead him by the hand. 
ACT.13.12	Then the proconsul believed when he saw what had happened, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.
ACT.13.13	Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem. 
ACT.13.14	But going on from Perga, they arrived at Pisidian Antioch, and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. 
ACT.13.15	After the reading of the Law and the Prophets the synagogue officials sent to them, saying, “Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.” 
ACT.13.16	Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said,
ACT.13.16	“
ACT.13.17	The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He led them out from it. 
ACT.13.18	For a period of about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness. 
ACT.13.19	When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land as an inheritance—
ACT.13.20	After these things He gave 
ACT.13.21	Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. 
ACT.13.22	After He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king, concerning whom He also testified and said, ‘I 
ACT.13.23	From the descendants of this man, according to promise, God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, 
ACT.13.24	after John had proclaimed before His coming a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 
ACT.13.25	And while John was completing his course, he kept saying, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not 
ACT.13.26	“Brethren, sons of Abraham’s family, and those among you who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent. 
ACT.13.27	For those who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers, recognizing neither Him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled 
ACT.13.28	And though they found no ground for 
ACT.13.29	When they had carried out all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in a tomb. 
ACT.13.30	But God raised Him from the dead; 
ACT.13.31	and for many days He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, the very ones who are now His witnesses to the people. 
ACT.13.32	And we preach to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers, 
ACT.13.33	that God has fulfilled this 
ACT.13.34	 that He raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to decay, He has spoken in this way: ‘I 
ACT.13.35	Therefore He also says in another 
ACT.13.36	For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid among his fathers and underwent decay; 
ACT.13.37	but He whom God raised did not undergo decay. 
ACT.13.38	Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, 
ACT.13.39	and through Him everyone who believes is freed from all things, from which you could not be freed through the Law of Moses. 
ACT.13.40	Therefore take heed, so that the thing spoken of in the Prophets may not come upon 
ACT.13.41	‘B
ACT.13.41	F
ACT.13.41	A 
ACT.13.42	As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people kept begging that these things might be spoken to them the next Sabbath. 
ACT.13.43	Now when 
ACT.13.44	The next Sabbath nearly the whole city assembled to hear the word of the Lord. 
ACT.13.45	But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and 
ACT.13.46	Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, “It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first; since you repudiate it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles. 
ACT.13.47	For so the Lord has commanded us,
ACT.13.47	‘I 
ACT.13.47	T
ACT.13.48	When the Gentiles heard this, they 
ACT.13.49	And the word of the Lord was being spread through the whole region. 
ACT.13.50	But the Jews incited the devout women of prominence and the leading men of the city, and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district. 
ACT.13.51	But they shook off the dust of their feet 
ACT.13.52	And the disciples were continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
ACT.14.1	In Iconium they entered the synagogue of the Jews together, and spoke in such a manner that a large number of people believed, both of Jews and of Greeks. 
ACT.14.2	But the Jews who disbelieved stirred up the minds of the Gentiles and embittered them against the brethren. 
ACT.14.3	Therefore they spent a long time 
ACT.14.4	But the people of the city were divided; and some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles. 
ACT.14.5	And when an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to mistreat and to stone them, 
ACT.14.6	they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region; 
ACT.14.7	and there they continued to preach the gospel.
ACT.14.8	At Lystra a man was sitting who had no strength in his feet, lame from his mother’s womb, who had never walked. 
ACT.14.9	This man was listening to Paul as he spoke, who, when he had fixed his gaze on him and had seen that he had faith to be made well, 
ACT.14.10	said with a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet.” And he leaped up and 
ACT.14.11	When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voice, saying in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have become like men and have come down to us.” 
ACT.14.12	And they 
ACT.14.13	The priest of Zeus, whose 
ACT.14.14	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd, crying out 
ACT.14.15	and saying, “Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men of the same nature as you, and preach the gospel to you that you should turn from these 
ACT.14.16	In the generations gone by He permitted all the nations to go their own ways; 
ACT.14.17	and yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.” 
ACT.14.18	 saying these things, with difficulty they restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them.
ACT.14.19	But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead. 
ACT.14.20	But while the disciples stood around him, he got up and entered the city. The next day he went away with Barnabas to Derbe. 
ACT.14.21	After they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, 
ACT.14.22	strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and 
ACT.14.23	When they had appointed elders for them in every church, having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
ACT.14.24	They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia. 
ACT.14.25	When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. 
ACT.14.26	From there they sailed to Antioch, from which they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had accomplished. 
ACT.14.27	When they had arrived and gathered the church together, they 
ACT.14.28	And they spent a long time with the disciples.
ACT.15.1	Some men came down from Judea and 
ACT.15.2	And when Paul and Barnabas had great dissension and debate with them, 
ACT.15.3	Therefore, being sent on their way by the church, they were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and were bringing great joy to all the brethren. 
ACT.15.4	When they arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them. 
ACT.15.5	But some of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed stood up, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses.”
ACT.15.6	The apostles and the elders came together to look into this matter. 
ACT.15.7	After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brethren, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe. 
ACT.15.8	And God, who knows the heart, testified to them giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us; 
ACT.15.9	and He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. 
ACT.15.10	Now therefore why do you put God to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? 
ACT.15.11	But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they also are.”
ACT.15.12	All the people kept silent, and they were listening to Barnabas and Paul as they were relating what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.
ACT.15.13	After they had stopped speaking, James answered, saying, “Brethren, listen to me. 
ACT.15.14	Simeon has related how God first concerned Himself about taking from among the Gentiles a people for His name. 
ACT.15.15	With this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written,
ACT.15.16	‘A
ACT.15.16	A
ACT.15.16	A
ACT.15.16	A
ACT.15.17	S
ACT.15.17	A
ACT.15.18	S
ACT.15.19	Therefore it is my judgment that we do not trouble those who are turning to God from among the Gentiles, 
ACT.15.20	but that we write to them that they abstain from things contaminated by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood. 
ACT.15.21	For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him, since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath.”
ACT.15.22	Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas—Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren, 
ACT.15.23	and they sent this letter by them,
ACT.15.23	“The apostles and the brethren who are elders, to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles, greetings.
ACT.15.24	Since we have heard that some of our number to whom we gave no instruction have disturbed you with 
ACT.15.25	it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to select men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
ACT.15.26	men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
ACT.15.27	Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will also report the same things by word 
ACT.15.28	For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials:
ACT.15.29	that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. Farewell.”
ACT.15.30	So when they were sent away, they went down to Antioch; and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter. 
ACT.15.31	When they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement. 
ACT.15.32	Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brethren with a lengthy message. 
ACT.15.33	After they had spent time 
ACT.15.34	[
ACT.15.35	But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching with many others also, the word of the Lord.
ACT.15.36	After some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us return and visit the brethren in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, 
ACT.15.37	Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also. 
ACT.15.38	But Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. 
ACT.15.39	And there occurred such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus. 
ACT.15.40	But Paul chose Silas and left, being committed by the brethren to the grace of the Lord. 
ACT.15.41	And he was traveling through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
ACT.16.1	Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And a disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek, 
ACT.16.2	and he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium. 
ACT.16.3	Paul wanted this man to go with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. 
ACT.16.4	Now while they were passing through the cities, they were delivering the decrees which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem, for them to observe. 
ACT.16.5	So the churches were being strengthened in the faith, and were increasing in number daily.
ACT.16.6	They passed through the Phrygian and Galatian region, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia; 
ACT.16.7	and after they came to Mysia, they were trying to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them; 
ACT.16.8	and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas. 
ACT.16.9	A vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing and appealing to him, and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.” 
ACT.16.10	When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
ACT.16.11	So putting out to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day following to Neapolis; 
ACT.16.12	and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia, a 
ACT.16.13	And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to a riverside, where we were supposing that there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled.
ACT.16.14	A woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, a worshiper of God, was listening; and the Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul. 
ACT.16.15	And when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.” And she prevailed upon us.
ACT.16.16	It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a slave-girl having a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing her masters much profit by fortune-telling. 
ACT.16.17	Following after Paul and us, she kept crying out, saying, “These men are bond-servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation.” 
ACT.16.18	She continued doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out at that very moment.
ACT.16.19	But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place before the authorities, 
ACT.16.20	and when they had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, “These men are throwing our city into confusion, being Jews, 
ACT.16.21	and are proclaiming customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans.”
ACT.16.22	The crowd rose up together against them, and the chief magistrates tore their robes off them and proceeded to order 
ACT.16.23	When they had struck them with many blows, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely; 
ACT.16.24	and he, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
ACT.16.25	But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them; 
ACT.16.26	and suddenly there came a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone’s chains were unfastened. 
ACT.16.27	When the jailer awoke and saw the prison doors opened, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. 
ACT.16.28	But Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!” 
ACT.16.29	And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas, 
ACT.16.30	and after he brought them out, he said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”
ACT.16.31	They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.” 
ACT.16.32	And they spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house. 
ACT.16.33	And he took them that 
ACT.16.34	And he brought them into his house and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, having believed in God with his whole household.
ACT.16.35	Now when day came, the chief magistrates sent their policemen, saying, “Release those men.” 
ACT.16.36	And the jailer reported these words to Paul, 
ACT.16.37	But Paul said to them, “They have beaten us in public without trial, men who are Romans, and have thrown us into prison; and now are they sending us away secretly? No indeed! But let them come themselves and bring us out.” 
ACT.16.38	The policemen reported these words to the chief magistrates. They were afraid when they heard that they were Romans, 
ACT.16.39	and they came and appealed to them, and when they had brought them out, they kept begging them to leave the city. 
ACT.16.40	They went out of the prison and entered 
ACT.17.1	Now when they had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. 
ACT.17.2	And according to Paul’s custom, he went to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures, 
ACT.17.3	explaining and giving evidence that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and 
ACT.17.4	And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a large number of the God-fearing Greeks and a number of the leading women. 
ACT.17.5	But the Jews, becoming jealous and taking along some wicked men from the market place, formed a mob and set the city in an uproar; and attacking the house of Jason, they were seeking to bring them out to the people. 
ACT.17.6	When they did not find them, they 
ACT.17.7	and Jason has welcomed them, and they all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.” 
ACT.17.8	They stirred up the crowd and the city authorities who heard these things. 
ACT.17.9	And when they had received a pledge from Jason and the others, they released them.
ACT.17.10	The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews. 
ACT.17.11	Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily 
ACT.17.12	Therefore many of them believed, along with a number of prominent Greek women and men. 
ACT.17.13	But when the Jews of Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there as well, agitating and stirring up the crowds. 
ACT.17.14	Then immediately the brethren sent Paul out to go as far as the sea; and Silas and Timothy remained there. 
ACT.17.15	Now those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left.
ACT.17.16	Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was being provoked within him as he was observing the city full of idols. 
ACT.17.17	So he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing 
ACT.17.18	And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him. Some were saying, “What would this idle babbler wish to say?” Others, “He seems to be a proclaimer of strange deities,”—because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection. 
ACT.17.19	And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching is which you are proclaiming? 
ACT.17.20	For you are bringing some strange things to our ears; so we want to know what these things mean.” 
ACT.17.21	(Now all the Athenians and the strangers visiting there used to spend their time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)
ACT.17.22	So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects. 
ACT.17.23	For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription, ‘TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.’ Therefore what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you. 
ACT.17.24	The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands; 
ACT.17.25	nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all 
ACT.17.26	and He made from one 
ACT.17.27	that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; 
ACT.17.28	for in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we also are His children.’ 
ACT.17.29	Being then the children of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and thought of man. 
ACT.17.30	Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all 
ACT.17.31	because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead.”
ACT.17.32	Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some 
ACT.17.33	So Paul went out of their midst. 
ACT.17.34	But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.
ACT.18.1	After these things he left Athens and went to Corinth. 
ACT.18.2	And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He came to them, 
ACT.18.3	and because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and they were working, for by trade they were tent-makers. 
ACT.18.4	And he was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.
ACT.18.5	But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul 
ACT.18.6	But when they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, “Your blood 
ACT.18.7	Then he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next to the synagogue. 
ACT.18.8	Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard were believing and being baptized. 
ACT.18.9	And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, 
ACT.18.11	And he settled 
ACT.18.12	But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat, 
ACT.18.13	saying, “This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.” 
ACT.18.14	But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you; 
ACT.18.15	but if there are questions about words and names and your own law, look after it yourselves; I am unwilling to be a judge of these matters.” 
ACT.18.16	And he drove them away from the judgment seat. 
ACT.18.17	And they all took hold of Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and 
ACT.18.18	Paul, having remained many days longer, took leave of the brethren and put out to sea for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he was keeping a vow. 
ACT.18.19	They came to Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. 
ACT.18.20	When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did not consent, 
ACT.18.21	but taking leave of them and saying, “I will return to you again if God wills,” he set sail from Ephesus.
ACT.18.22	When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch.
ACT.18.23	And having spent some time 
ACT.18.24	Now a Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the Scriptures. 
ACT.18.25	This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, being acquainted only with the baptism of John; 
ACT.18.26	and he began to speak out boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. 
ACT.18.27	And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him; and when he had arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace, 
ACT.18.28	for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
ACT.19.1	It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples. 
ACT.19.2	He said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” And they 
ACT.19.3	And he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” And they said, “Into John’s baptism.” 
ACT.19.4	Paul said, “John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.” 
ACT.19.5	When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.19.6	And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they 
ACT.19.7	There were in all about twelve men.
ACT.19.8	And he entered the synagogue and continued speaking out boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading 
ACT.19.9	But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the people, he withdrew from them and took away the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus. 
ACT.19.10	This took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
ACT.19.11	God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, 
ACT.19.12	so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out. 
ACT.19.13	But also some of the Jewish exorcists, who went from place to place, attempted to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, “I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.” 
ACT.19.14	Seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. 
ACT.19.15	And the evil spirit answered and said to them, “I recognize Jesus, and I know about Paul, but who are you?” 
ACT.19.16	And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaped on them and subdued all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. 
ACT.19.17	This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified. 
ACT.19.18	Many also of those who had believed kept coming, confessing and disclosing their practices. 
ACT.19.19	And many of those who practiced magic brought their books together and 
ACT.19.20	So the word of the Lord was growing mightily and prevailing.
ACT.19.21	Now after these things were finished, Paul purposed in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, “After I have been there, I must also see Rome.” 
ACT.19.22	And having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
ACT.19.23	About that time there occurred no small disturbance concerning the Way. 
ACT.19.24	For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the craftsmen; 
ACT.19.25	these he gathered together with the workmen of similar 
ACT.19.26	You see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made with hands are no gods 
ACT.19.27	Not only is there danger that this trade of ours fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence.”
ACT.19.28	When they heard 
ACT.19.29	The city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia. 
ACT.19.30	And when Paul wanted to go into the assembly, the disciples would not let him. 
ACT.19.31	Also some of the 
ACT.19.32	So then, some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion and the majority did not know for what reason they had come together. 
ACT.19.33	Some of the crowd concluded 
ACT.19.34	But when they recognized that he was a Jew, a 
ACT.19.35	After quieting the crowd, the town clerk *said, “Men of Ephesus, what man is there after all who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the 
ACT.19.36	So, since these are undeniable facts, you ought to keep calm and to do nothing rash. 
ACT.19.37	For you have brought these men 
ACT.19.38	So then, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against any man, the courts are in session and proconsuls are 
ACT.19.39	But if you want anything beyond this, it shall be settled in the lawful assembly. 
ACT.19.40	For indeed we are in danger of being accused of a riot in connection with today’s events, since there is no 
ACT.19.41	After saying this he dismissed the assembly.
ACT.20.1	After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and when he had exhorted them and taken his leave of them, he left to go to Macedonia. 
ACT.20.2	When he had gone through those districts and had given them much exhortation, he came to Greece. 
ACT.20.3	And 
ACT.20.4	And he was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, 
ACT.20.5	But these had gone on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas. 
ACT.20.6	We sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas within five days; and there we stayed seven days.
ACT.20.7	On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul 
ACT.20.8	There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together. 
ACT.20.9	And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting on the window sill, sinking into a deep sleep; and as Paul kept on talking, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead. 
ACT.20.10	But Paul went down and fell upon him, and after embracing him, he said, “Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.” 
ACT.20.11	When he had gone 
ACT.20.12	They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted.
ACT.20.13	But we, going ahead to the ship, set sail for Assos, intending from there to take Paul on board; for so he had arranged it, intending himself to go by land. 
ACT.20.14	And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene. 
ACT.20.15	Sailing from there, we arrived the following day opposite Chios; and the next day we crossed over to Samos; and the day following we came to Miletus. 
ACT.20.16	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.
ACT.20.17	From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church. 
ACT.20.18	And when they had come to him, he said to them,
ACT.20.18	“
ACT.20.19	serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews; 
ACT.20.20	how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly and from house to house, 
ACT.20.21	solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ACT.20.22	And now, behold, bound by the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there, 
ACT.20.23	except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me. 
ACT.20.24	But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of God.
ACT.20.25	“And now, behold, I know that all of you, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will no longer see my face. 
ACT.20.26	Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men. 
ACT.20.27	For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God. 
ACT.20.28	Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood. 
ACT.20.29	I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; 
ACT.20.30	and from among your own selves men will arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. 
ACT.20.31	Therefore be on the alert, remembering that night and day for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish each one with tears. 
ACT.20.32	And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build 
ACT.20.33	I have coveted no one’s silver or gold or clothes. 
ACT.20.34	You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my 
ACT.20.35	In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, 
ACT.20.36	When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. 
ACT.20.37	And they 
ACT.20.38	grieving especially over the word which he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they were accompanying him to the ship.
ACT.21.1	When we had parted from them and had set sail, we ran a straight course to Cos and the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara; 
ACT.21.2	and having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail. 
ACT.21.3	When we came in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left, we kept sailing to Syria and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo. 
ACT.21.4	After looking up the disciples, we stayed there seven days; and they kept telling Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.5	When our days there were ended, we left and started on our journey, while they all, with wives and children, escorted us until 
ACT.21.6	Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.
ACT.21.7	When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and after greeting the brethren, we stayed with them for a day. 
ACT.21.8	On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entering the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him. 
ACT.21.9	Now this man had four virgin daughters who were prophetesses. 
ACT.21.10	As we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. 
ACT.21.11	And coming to us, he took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands, and said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says: ‘In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’ ” 
ACT.21.12	When we had heard this, we as well as the local residents 
ACT.21.13	Then Paul answered, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” 
ACT.21.14	And since he would not be persuaded, we fell silent, remarking, “The will of the Lord be done!”
ACT.21.15	After these days we got ready and started on our way up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.16	 of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us, taking us to Mnason of Cyprus, a disciple of long standing with whom we were to lodge.
ACT.21.17	After we arrived in Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. 
ACT.21.18	And the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. 
ACT.21.19	After he had greeted them, he 
ACT.21.20	And when they heard it they 
ACT.21.21	and they have been told about you, that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs. 
ACT.21.22	What, then, is 
ACT.21.23	Therefore do this that we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow; 
ACT.21.24	take them and purify yourself along with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things which they have been told about you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the Law. 
ACT.21.25	But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote, having decided that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication.” 
ACT.21.26	Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purifying himself along with them, went into the temple giving notice of the completion of the days of purification, until the sacrifice was offered for each one of them.
ACT.21.27	When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, upon seeing him in the temple, 
ACT.21.28	crying out, “Men of Israel, come to our aid! This is the man who preaches to all men everywhere against our people and the Law and this place; and besides he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.” 
ACT.21.29	For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple. 
ACT.21.30	Then all the city was provoked, and the people rushed together, and taking hold of Paul they dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut. 
ACT.21.31	While they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the 
ACT.21.32	At once he took along 
ACT.21.33	Then the commander came up and took hold of him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains; and he 
ACT.21.34	But among the crowd some were shouting one thing 
ACT.21.35	When he got to the stairs, he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob; 
ACT.21.36	for the multitude of the people kept following them, shouting, “Away with him!”
ACT.21.37	As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, “May I say something to you?” And he *said, “Do you know Greek? 
ACT.21.38	Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?” 
ACT.21.39	But Paul said, “I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city; and I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.” 
ACT.21.40	When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, motioned to the people with his hand; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, saying,
ACT.22.1	“Brethren and fathers, hear my defense which I now 
ACT.22.2	And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew dialect, they became even more quiet; and he *said,
ACT.22.3	“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today. 
ACT.22.4	I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and putting both men and women into prisons, 
ACT.22.5	as also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished.
ACT.22.6	“But it happened that as I was on my way, approaching Damascus about noontime, a very bright light suddenly flashed from heaven all around me, 
ACT.22.7	and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 
ACT.22.8	And I answered, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And He said to me, 
ACT.22.9	And those who were with me saw the light, to be sure, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me. 
ACT.22.10	And I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, 
ACT.22.11	But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.
ACT.22.12	“A certain Ananias, a man who was devout by the standard of the Law, 
ACT.22.13	came to me, and standing near said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that very time I looked up at him. 
ACT.22.14	And he said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will and to see the Righteous One and to hear an utterance from His mouth. 
ACT.22.15	For you will be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard. 
ACT.22.16	Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.’
ACT.22.17	“It happened when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I fell into a trance, 
ACT.22.18	and I saw Him saying to me, 
ACT.22.19	And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves understand that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in You. 
ACT.22.20	And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I also was standing by approving, and watching out for the coats of those who were slaying him.’ 
ACT.22.21	And He said to me, 
ACT.22.22	They listened to him up to this statement, and 
ACT.22.23	And as they were crying out and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air, 
ACT.22.24	the 
ACT.22.25	But when they stretched him out with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, “Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?” 
ACT.22.26	When the centurion heard 
ACT.22.27	The commander came and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman?” And he said, “Yes.” 
ACT.22.28	The commander answered, “I acquired this citizenship with a large sum of money.” And Paul said, “But I was actually born 
ACT.22.29	Therefore those who were about to examine him immediately let go of him; and the commander also was afraid when he found out that he was a Roman, and because he had put him in chains.
ACT.22.30	But on the next day, wishing to know for certain why he had been accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and set him before them.
ACT.23.1	Paul, looking intently at the Council, said, “Brethren, I have lived my life with a perfectly good conscience before God up to this day.” 
ACT.23.2	The high priest Ananias commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth. 
ACT.23.3	Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to try me according to the Law, and in violation of the Law order me to be struck?” 
ACT.23.4	But the bystanders said, “Do you revile God’s high priest?” 
ACT.23.5	And Paul said, “I was not aware, brethren, that he was high priest; for it is written, ‘Y
ACT.23.6	But perceiving that one group were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, Paul 
ACT.23.7	As he said this, there occurred a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. 
ACT.23.8	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor an angel, nor a spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all. 
ACT.23.9	And there occurred a great uproar; and some of the scribes of the Pharisaic party stood up and 
ACT.23.10	And as a great dissension was developing, the 
ACT.23.11	But on the night 
ACT.23.12	When it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul. 
ACT.23.13	There were more than forty who formed this plot. 
ACT.23.14	They came to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul. 
ACT.23.15	Now therefore, you and the Council notify the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case by a more thorough investigation; and we for our part are ready to slay him before he comes near 
ACT.23.16	But the son of Paul’s sister heard of their ambush, and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul. 
ACT.23.17	Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, “Lead this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him.” 
ACT.23.18	So he took him and led him to the commander and *said, “Paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to lead this young man to you since he has something to tell you.” 
ACT.23.19	The commander took him by the hand and stepping aside, 
ACT.23.20	And he said, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Council, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more thoroughly about him. 
ACT.23.21	So do not listen to them, for more than forty of them are lying in wait for him who have bound themselves under a curse not to eat or drink until they slay him; and now they are ready and waiting for the promise from you.” 
ACT.23.22	So the commander let the young man go, instructing him, “Tell no one that you have notified me of these things.”
ACT.23.23	And he called to him two of the centurions and said, “Get two hundred soldiers ready by 
ACT.23.24	 also to provide mounts to put Paul on and bring him safely to Felix the governor. 
ACT.23.25	And he wrote a letter having this form:
ACT.23.26	“Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.
ACT.23.27	“When this man was arrested by the Jews and was about to be slain by them, I came up to them with the troops and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
ACT.23.28	And wanting to ascertain the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Council;
ACT.23.29	and I found him to be accused over questions about their Law, but under no accusation deserving death or imprisonment.
ACT.23.30	“When I was informed that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, also instructing his accusers to bring charges against him before you.”
ACT.23.31	So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. 
ACT.23.32	But the next day, leaving the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the barracks. 
ACT.23.33	When these had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him. 
ACT.23.34	When he had read it, he asked from what province he was, and when he learned that he was from Cilicia, 
ACT.23.35	he said, “I will give you a hearing after your accusers arrive also,” giving orders for him to be kept in Herod’s 
ACT.24.1	After five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders, with an attorney 
ACT.24.2	After 
ACT.24.2	“
ACT.24.3	we acknowledge 
ACT.24.4	But, that I may not weary you any further, I beg you to grant us, by your kindness, a brief hearing. 
ACT.24.5	For we have found this man a real pest and a fellow who stirs up dissension among all the Jews throughout 
ACT.24.6	And he even tried to desecrate the temple; and then we arrested him. [
ACT.24.7	But Lysias the commander came along, and with much violence took him out of our hands, 
ACT.24.8	ordering his accusers to come before you.] By examining him yourself concerning all these matters you will be able to ascertain the things of which we accuse him.” 
ACT.24.9	The Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so.
ACT.24.10	When the governor had nodded for him to speak, Paul responded:
ACT.24.10	“
ACT.24.11	since you can take note of the fact that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 
ACT.24.12	Neither in the temple, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city 
ACT.24.13	Nor can they prove to you 
ACT.24.14	But this I admit to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect I do serve the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets; 
ACT.24.15	having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. 
ACT.24.16	In view of this, I also do my best to maintain always a blameless conscience 
ACT.24.17	Now after several years I came to bring 
ACT.24.18	in which they found me 
ACT.24.19	who ought to have been present before you and to make accusation, if they should have anything against me. 
ACT.24.20	Or else let these men themselves tell what misdeed they found when I stood before the Council, 
ACT.24.21	other than for this one statement which I shouted out while standing among them, ‘For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today.’ ”
ACT.24.22	But Felix, having a more exact knowledge about the Way, put them off, saying, “When Lysias the 
ACT.24.23	Then he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept in custody and 
ACT.24.24	But some days later Felix arrived with Drusilla, his wife who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him 
ACT.24.25	But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, “Go away for the present, and when I find time I will summon you.” 
ACT.24.26	At the same time too, he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul; therefore he also used to send for him quite often and converse with him. 
ACT.24.27	But after two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and wishing to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul imprisoned.
ACT.25.1	Festus then, having arrived in the province, three days later went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. 
ACT.25.2	And the chief priests and the leading men of the Jews brought charges against Paul, and they were urging him, 
ACT.25.3	requesting a concession against Paul, that he might have him brought to Jerusalem (
ACT.25.4	Festus then answered that Paul was being kept in custody at Caesarea and that he himself was about to leave shortly. 
ACT.25.5	“Therefore,” he *said, “let the influential men among you go there with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them prosecute him.”
ACT.25.6	After he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought. 
ACT.25.7	After Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him which they could not prove, 
ACT.25.8	while Paul said in his own defense, “I have committed no offense either against the Law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar.” 
ACT.25.9	But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me on these 
ACT.25.10	But Paul said, “I am standing before Caesar’s tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to 
ACT.25.11	If, then, I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of those things is 
ACT.25.12	Then when Festus had conferred with his council, he answered, “You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go.”
ACT.25.13	Now when several days had elapsed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and paid their respects to Festus. 
ACT.25.14	While they were spending many days there, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying, “There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix; 
ACT.25.15	and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him. 
ACT.25.16	I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has an opportunity to make his defense against the charges. 
ACT.25.17	So after they had assembled here, I did not delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought before me. 
ACT.25.18	When the accusers stood up, they 
ACT.25.19	but they 
ACT.25.20	Being at a loss how to investigate such matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there stand trial on these matters. 
ACT.25.21	But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for 
ACT.25.22	Then Agrippa 
ACT.25.23	So, on the next day when Agrippa came together with Bernice amid great pomp, and entered the auditorium 
ACT.25.24	Festus *said, “King Agrippa, and all you gentlemen here present with us, you see this man about whom all the people of the Jews appealed to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly declaring that he ought not to live any longer. 
ACT.25.25	But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death; and since he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him. 
ACT.25.26	Yet I have nothing definite about him to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him before you 
ACT.25.27	For it seems absurd to me in sending a prisoner, not to indicate also the charges against him.”
ACT.26.1	Agrippa said to Paul, “You are permitted to speak for yourself.” Then Paul stretched out his hand and 
ACT.26.2	“In regard to all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, that I am about to make my defense before you today; 
ACT.26.3	especially because you are an expert in all customs and questions among 
ACT.26.4	“So then, all Jews know my manner of life from my youth up, which from the beginning was spent among my 
ACT.26.5	since they have known about me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that I lived 
ACT.26.6	And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers; 
ACT.26.7	 to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly serve 
ACT.26.8	Why is it considered incredible among you 
ACT.26.9	“So then, I thought to myself that I had to do many things hostile to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
ACT.26.10	And this is just what I did in Jerusalem; not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, but also when they were being put to death I cast my vote against them. 
ACT.26.11	And as I punished them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to blaspheme; and being furiously enraged at them, I kept pursuing them even to foreign cities.
ACT.26.12	“While so engaged as I was journeying to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests, 
ACT.26.13	at midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining all around me and those who were journeying with me. 
ACT.26.14	And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew dialect, 
ACT.26.15	And I said, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And the Lord said, 
ACT.26.19	“So, King Agrippa, I did not prove disobedient to the heavenly vision, 
ACT.26.20	but 
ACT.26.21	For this reason 
ACT.26.22	So, having obtained help from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, stating nothing but what the Prophets and Moses said was going to take place; 
ACT.26.23	that the Christ was to suffer, 
ACT.26.24	While 
ACT.26.25	But Paul *said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I utter words of sober truth. 
ACT.26.26	For the king knows about these matters, and I speak to him also with confidence, since I am persuaded that none of these things escape his notice; for this has not been done in a corner. 
ACT.26.27	King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you do.” 
ACT.26.28	Agrippa 
ACT.26.29	And Paul 
ACT.26.30	The king stood up and the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them, 
ACT.26.31	and when they had gone aside, they 
ACT.26.32	And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”
ACT.27.1	When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, they proceeded to deliver Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan 
ACT.27.2	And embarking in an Adramyttian ship, which was about to sail to the regions along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica. 
ACT.27.3	The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul with consideration and allowed him to go to his friends and receive care. 
ACT.27.4	From there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary. 
ACT.27.5	When we had sailed through the sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia. 
ACT.27.6	There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it. 
ACT.27.7	When we had sailed slowly for a good many days, and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus, since the wind did not permit us 
ACT.27.8	and with difficulty sailing past it we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.
ACT.27.9	When considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, since even the 
ACT.27.10	and said to them, “Men, I perceive that the voyage will certainly be with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.” 
ACT.27.11	But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the captain of the ship than by what was being said by Paul. 
ACT.27.12	Because the harbor was not suitable for wintering, the majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there, if somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter 
ACT.27.13	When a moderate south wind came up, supposing that they had attained their purpose, they weighed anchor and 
ACT.27.14	But before very long there rushed down from the land a violent wind, called 
ACT.27.15	and when the ship was caught 
ACT.27.16	Running under the shelter of a small island called Clauda, we were scarcely able to get the 
ACT.27.17	After they had hoisted it up, they used supporting cables in undergirding the ship; and fearing that they might run aground on 
ACT.27.18	The next day as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to jettison the cargo; 
ACT.27.19	and on the third day they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands. 
ACT.27.20	Since neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm was assailing 
ACT.27.21	When they had gone a long time without food, then Paul stood up in their midst and said, “Men, you ought to have followed my advice and not to have set sail from Crete and incurred this damage and loss. 
ACT.27.22	 now I urge you to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but 
ACT.27.23	For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood before me, 
ACT.27.24	saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you.’ 
ACT.27.25	Therefore, keep up your courage, men, for I believe God that it will turn out exactly as I have been told. 
ACT.27.26	But we must run aground on a certain island.”
ACT.27.27	But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors 
ACT.27.28	They took soundings and found 
ACT.27.29	Fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks, they cast four anchors from the stern and wished for daybreak. 
ACT.27.30	But as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had let down the 
ACT.27.31	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, “Unless these men remain in the ship, you yourselves cannot be saved.” 
ACT.27.32	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the 
ACT.27.33	Until the day was about to dawn, Paul was encouraging them all to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have been constantly watching and going without eating, having taken nothing. 
ACT.27.34	Therefore I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your preservation, for not a hair from the head of any of you will perish.” 
ACT.27.35	Having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it and began to eat. 
ACT.27.36	All of them were encouraged and they themselves also took food. 
ACT.27.37	All of us in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six persons. 
ACT.27.38	When they had eaten enough, they 
ACT.27.39	When day came, they could not recognize the land; but they did observe a bay with a beach, and they resolved to drive the ship onto it if they could. 
ACT.27.40	And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea while at the same time they were loosening the ropes of the rudders; and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they were heading for the beach. 
ACT.27.41	But striking a reef where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern 
ACT.27.42	The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none 
ACT.27.43	but the centurion, wanting to bring Paul safely through, kept them from their intention, and commanded that those who could swim should jump overboard first and get to land, 
ACT.27.44	and the rest 
ACT.28.1	When they had been brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta. 
ACT.28.2	The natives showed us extraordinary kindness; for because of the rain that had set in and because of the cold, they kindled a fire and received us all. 
ACT.28.3	But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand. 
ACT.28.4	When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they 
ACT.28.5	However he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm. 
ACT.28.6	But they were expecting that he was about to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and 
ACT.28.7	Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us courteously three days. 
ACT.28.8	And it happened that the father of Publius was lying 
ACT.28.9	After this had happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases were coming to him and getting cured. 
ACT.28.10	They also honored us with many marks of respect; and when we were setting sail, they supplied 
ACT.28.11	At the end of three months we set sail on an Alexandrian ship which had wintered at the island, and which had the Twin Brothers for its figurehead. 
ACT.28.12	After we put in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days. 
ACT.28.13	From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium, and a day later a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli. 
ACT.28.14	There we found 
ACT.28.15	And the brethren, when they heard about us, came from there as far as the Market of Appius and Three Inns to meet us; and when Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.
ACT.28.16	When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.
ACT.28.17	After three days Paul called together those who were the leading men of the Jews, and when they came together, he 
ACT.28.18	And when they had examined me, they were willing to release me because there was no ground for putting me to death. 
ACT.28.19	But when the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar, not that I had any accusation against my nation. 
ACT.28.20	For this reason, therefore, I requested to see you and to speak with you, for I am wearing this chain for the sake of the hope of Israel.” 
ACT.28.21	They said to him, “We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren come here and reported or spoken anything bad about you. 
ACT.28.22	But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.”
ACT.28.23	When they had set a day for Paul, they came to him at his lodging in large numbers; and he was explaining to them by solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, from both the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from morning until evening. 
ACT.28.24	Some were being persuaded by the things spoken, but others would not believe. 
ACT.28.25	And when they did not agree with one another, they

ACT.28.29	[

ACT.28.31	preaching the kingdom of God and teaching concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all openness, unhindered.
ROM.1.1	Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called 
ROM.1.2	which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, 
ROM.1.3	concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh, 
ROM.1.4	who was declared the Son of God with power 
ROM.1.5	through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about 
ROM.1.6	among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ;
ROM.1.7	to all who are beloved of God in Rome, called 
ROM.1.8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world. 
ROM.1.9	For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the 
ROM.1.10	always in my prayers making request, if perhaps now at last by the will of God I may succeed in coming to you. 
ROM.1.11	For I long to see you so that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, that you may be established; 
ROM.1.12	that is, that I may be encouraged together with you 
ROM.1.13	I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that often I have planned to come to you (and have been prevented so far) so that I may obtain some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles. 
ROM.1.14	I am 
ROM.1.15	So, for my part, I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
ROM.1.16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. 
ROM.1.17	For in it 
ROM.1.18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, 
ROM.1.19	because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them. 
ROM.1.20	For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. 
ROM.1.21	For even though they knew God, they did not 
ROM.1.22	Professing to be wise, they became fools, 
ROM.1.23	and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and 
ROM.1.24	Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them. 
ROM.1.25	For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
ROM.1.26	For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 
ROM.1.27	and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.
ROM.1.28	And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper, 
ROM.1.29	being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; 
ROM.1.30	slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 
ROM.1.31	without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful; 
ROM.1.32	and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.
ROM.2.1	Therefore you have no excuse, everyone of you who passes judgment, for in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things. 
ROM.2.2	And we know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who practice such things. 
ROM.2.3	But do you suppose this, O man, when you pass judgment on those who practice such things and do the same 
ROM.2.4	Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance? 
ROM.2.5	But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, 
ROM.2.6	who 
ROM.2.7	to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life; 
ROM.2.8	but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, wrath and indignation. 
ROM.2.9	 tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek, 
ROM.2.10	but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. 
ROM.2.11	For there is no partiality with God.
ROM.2.12	For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law; 
ROM.2.13	for 
ROM.2.14	For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, 
ROM.2.15	in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them, 
ROM.2.16	on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus.
ROM.2.17	But if you bear the name “Jew” and rely upon the Law and boast in God, 
ROM.2.18	and know 
ROM.2.19	and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, 
ROM.2.20	a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth, 
ROM.2.21	you, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal? 
ROM.2.22	You who say that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? 
ROM.2.23	You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the Law, do you dishonor God? 
ROM.2.24	For “
ROM.2.25	For indeed circumcision is of value if you practice the Law; but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. 
ROM.2.26	So if the uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? 
ROM.2.27	And he who is physically uncircumcised, if he keeps the Law, will he not judge you who though having the letter 
ROM.2.28	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh. 
ROM.2.29	But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God.
ROM.3.1	Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision? 
ROM.3.2	Great in every respect. First of all, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God. 
ROM.3.3	What then? If some did not believe, their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, will it? 
ROM.3.4	May it never be! Rather, let God be found true, though every man 
ROM.3.4	“T
ROM.3.4	A
ROM.3.5	But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous, is He? (I am speaking in human terms.) 
ROM.3.6	May it never be! For otherwise, how will God judge the world? 
ROM.3.7	But if through my lie the truth of God abounded to His glory, why am I also still being judged as a sinner? 
ROM.3.8	And why not 
ROM.3.9	What then? Are we better than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin;

ROM.3.19	Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God; 
ROM.3.20	because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law 
ROM.3.21	But now apart from the Law 
ROM.3.22	even 
ROM.3.23	for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 
ROM.3.24	being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; 
ROM.3.25	whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. 
ROM.3.26	for the demonstration, 
ROM.3.27	Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith. 
ROM.3.28	For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law. 
ROM.3.29	Or is God 
ROM.3.30	since indeed God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith is one.
ROM.3.31	Do we then nullify the Law through faith? May it never be! On the contrary, we establish the Law.
ROM.4.1	What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found? 
ROM.4.2	For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. 
ROM.4.3	For what does the Scripture say? “A
ROM.4.4	Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. 
ROM.4.5	But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness, 
ROM.4.6	just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
ROM.4.7	“B
ROM.4.7	A
ROM.4.8	B
ROM.4.9	Is this blessing then on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say, “F
ROM.4.10	How then was it credited? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised; 
ROM.4.11	and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them, 
ROM.4.12	and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised.
ROM.4.13	For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith. 
ROM.4.14	For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise is nullified; 
ROM.4.15	for the Law brings about wrath, but where there is no law, there also is no violation.
ROM.4.16	For this reason 
ROM.4.17	(as it is written, “A 
ROM.4.18	In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, “S
ROM.4.19	Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb; 
ROM.4.20	yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God, 
ROM.4.21	and being fully assured that what God had promised, He was able also to perform. 
ROM.4.22	Therefore 
ROM.4.23	Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him, 
ROM.4.24	but for our sake also, to whom it will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, 
ROM.4.25	 who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification.
ROM.5.1	Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
ROM.5.2	through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God. 
ROM.5.3	And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance; 
ROM.5.4	and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope; 
ROM.5.5	and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
ROM.5.6	For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. 
ROM.5.7	For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die. 
ROM.5.8	But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 
ROM.5.9	Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath 
ROM.5.10	For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. 
ROM.5.11	And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
ROM.5.12	Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned— 
ROM.5.13	for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 
ROM.5.14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a 
ROM.5.15	But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many. 
ROM.5.16	The gift is not like 
ROM.5.17	For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.
ROM.5.18	So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men. 
ROM.5.19	For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous. 
ROM.5.20	The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, 
ROM.5.21	so that, as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.6.1	What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase? 
ROM.6.2	May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in it? 
ROM.6.3	Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? 
ROM.6.4	Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. 
ROM.6.5	For if we have become united with 
ROM.6.6	knowing this, that our old self was crucified with 
ROM.6.7	for he who has died is freed from sin.
ROM.6.8	Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, 
ROM.6.9	knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, is never to die again; death no longer is master over Him. 
ROM.6.10	For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. 
ROM.6.11	Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
ROM.6.12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts, 
ROM.6.13	and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin 
ROM.6.14	For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.
ROM.6.15	What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be! 
ROM.6.16	Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone 
ROM.6.17	But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed, 
ROM.6.18	and having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. 
ROM.6.19	I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in 
ROM.6.20	For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. 
ROM.6.21	Therefore what benefit were you then deriving from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those things is death. 
ROM.6.22	But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life. 
ROM.6.23	For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.7.1	Or do you not know, brethren (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law has jurisdiction over a person as long as he lives? 
ROM.7.2	For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is living; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the husband. 
ROM.7.3	So then, if while her husband is living she is joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress though she is joined to another man.
ROM.7.4	Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God. 
ROM.7.5	For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were 
ROM.7.6	But now we have been released from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the 
ROM.7.7	What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? May it never be! On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the Law; for I would not have known about coveting if the Law had not said, “Y
ROM.7.8	But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind; for apart from the Law sin 
ROM.7.9	I was once alive apart from the Law; but when the commandment came, sin became alive and I died; 
ROM.7.10	and this commandment, which was to result in life, proved to result in death for me; 
ROM.7.11	for sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. 
ROM.7.12	So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.
ROM.7.13	Therefore did that which is good become 
ROM.7.14	For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold into bondage to sin. 
ROM.7.15	For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I 
ROM.7.16	But if I do the very thing I do not want 
ROM.7.17	So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me. 
ROM.7.18	For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good 
ROM.7.19	For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. 
ROM.7.20	But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.
ROM.7.21	I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good. 
ROM.7.22	For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man, 
ROM.7.23	but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members. 
ROM.7.24	Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of this death? 
ROM.7.25	Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin.
ROM.8.1	Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. 
ROM.8.2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death. 
ROM.8.3	For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God 
ROM.8.4	so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. 
ROM.8.5	For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. 
ROM.8.6	For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace, 
ROM.8.7	because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able 
ROM.8.8	and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
ROM.8.9	However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him. 
ROM.8.10	If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness. 
ROM.8.11	But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies 
ROM.8.12	So then, brethren, we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh— 
ROM.8.13	for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live. 
ROM.8.14	For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 
ROM.8.15	For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, “Abba! Father!” 
ROM.8.16	The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God, 
ROM.8.17	and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with 
ROM.8.18	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us. 
ROM.8.19	For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God. 
ROM.8.20	For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, 
ROM.8.21	that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. 
ROM.8.22	For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now. 
ROM.8.23	And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for 
ROM.8.24	For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he 
ROM.8.25	But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it.
ROM.8.26	In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for 
ROM.8.27	and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to 
ROM.8.28	And we know that 
ROM.8.29	For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined 
ROM.8.30	and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.
ROM.8.31	What then shall we say to these things? If God 
ROM.8.32	He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things? 
ROM.8.33	Who will bring a charge against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies; 
ROM.8.34	who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was 
ROM.8.35	Who will separate us from the love of 
ROM.8.36	Just as it is written,
ROM.8.36	“F
ROM.8.36	W
ROM.8.37	But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us. 
ROM.8.38	For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, 
ROM.8.39	nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.9.1	I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit, 
ROM.9.2	that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart. 
ROM.9.3	For I could wish that I myself were accursed, 
ROM.9.4	who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the 
ROM.9.5	whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.
ROM.9.6	But 
ROM.9.7	nor are they all children because they are Abraham’s descendants, but: “
ROM.9.8	That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants. 
ROM.9.9	For this is the word of promise: “A

ROM.9.20	On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, “Why did you make me like this,” will it? 
ROM.9.21	Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use? 
ROM.9.22	What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction? 
ROM.9.23	And 
ROM.9.24	 us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles.

ROM.9.31	but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at

ROM.9.33	just as it is written,

ROM.10.1	Brethren, my heart’s desire and my prayer to God for them is for

ROM.10.3	For not knowing about God’s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. 
ROM.10.4	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
ROM.10.5	For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness. 
ROM.10.6	But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows: “D

ROM.10.14	How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher? 
ROM.10.15	How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, “H
ROM.10.16	However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says, “L

ROM.10.18	But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have;

ROM.11.2	God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in 
ROM.11.3	“Lord, 
ROM.11.4	But what is the divine response to him? “I 
ROM.11.5	In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to 
ROM.11.6	But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace.

ROM.11.12	Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be! 
ROM.11.13	But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, 
ROM.11.14	if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them. 
ROM.11.15	For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will 
ROM.11.16	If the first piece

ROM.11.18	do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, 
ROM.11.19	You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.” 
ROM.11.20	Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear; 
ROM.11.21	for if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you, either. 
ROM.11.22	Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God’s kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off. 
ROM.11.23	And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 
ROM.11.24	For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural 
ROM.11.25	For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery—so that you will not be wise in your own estimation—that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in;

ROM.11.28	From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of 
ROM.11.29	for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. 
ROM.11.30	For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience, 
ROM.11.31	so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy. 
ROM.11.32	For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all.
ROM.11.33	Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways! 
ROM.11.34	For 
ROM.11.35	Or 
ROM.11.36	For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him 
ROM.12.1	Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, 
ROM.12.2	And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.
ROM.12.3	For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith. 
ROM.12.4	For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function, 
ROM.12.5	so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. 
ROM.12.6	Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, 
ROM.12.7	if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching; 
ROM.12.8	or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with 
ROM.12.10	 devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor; 
ROM.12.11	not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord; 
ROM.12.12	rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer, 
ROM.12.13	contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.
ROM.12.14	Bless those who persecute 
ROM.12.15	Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. 
ROM.12.16	Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation. 
ROM.12.17	Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all men. 
ROM.12.18	If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men. 
ROM.12.19	Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath 
ROM.12.20	“B
ROM.12.21	Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
ROM.13.1	Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. 
ROM.13.2	Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. 
ROM.13.3	For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; 
ROM.13.4	for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil. 
ROM.13.5	Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience’ sake. 
ROM.13.6	For because of this you also pay taxes, for

ROM.13.10	Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of 
ROM.13.12	The night is almost gone, and the day is near. Therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. 
ROM.13.13	Let us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and jealousy. 
ROM.13.14	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to 
ROM.14.1	Now accept the one who is weak in faith, 
ROM.14.2	One person has faith that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables 
ROM.14.3	The one who eats is not to regard with contempt the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat is not to judge the one who eats, for God has accepted him. 
ROM.14.4	Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls; and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.
ROM.14.5	One person regards one day above another, another regards every day 
ROM.14.6	He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and he who eats, does so for the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eats not, for the Lord he does not eat, and gives thanks to God. 
ROM.14.7	For not one of us lives for himself, and not one dies for himself; 
ROM.14.8	for if we live, we live for the Lord, or if we die, we die for the Lord; therefore whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s. 
ROM.14.9	For to this end Christ died and lived again, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
ROM.14.10	But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. 
ROM.14.11	For it is written,
ROM.14.11	“A
ROM.14.11	A
ROM.14.12	So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God.
ROM.14.13	Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather determine this—not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother’s way. 
ROM.14.14	I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but to him who thinks anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. 
ROM.14.15	For if because of food your brother is hurt, you are no longer walking according to love. Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died. 
ROM.14.16	Therefore do not let what is for you a good thing be spoken of as evil; 
ROM.14.17	for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 
ROM.14.18	For he who in this 
ROM.14.19	So then 
ROM.14.20	Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are clean, but they are evil for the man who eats and gives offense. 
ROM.14.21	It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine, or 
ROM.14.22	The faith which you have, have as your own conviction before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves. 
ROM.14.23	But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because 
ROM.15.1	Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength and not 
ROM.15.2	Each of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to his edification. 
ROM.15.3	For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, “T
ROM.15.4	For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. 
ROM.15.5	Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus, 
ROM.15.6	so that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.15.7	Therefore, accept one another, just as Christ also accepted us to the glory of God. 
ROM.15.8	For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm the promises 
ROM.15.9	and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written,
ROM.15.9	“T
ROM.15.9	A
ROM.15.10	Again he says,
ROM.15.10	“R
ROM.15.11	And again,

ROM.15.12	Again Isaiah says,

ROM.15.12	I
ROM.15.13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
ROM.15.14	And concerning you, my brethren, I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able also to admonish one another. 
ROM.15.15	But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me from God, 
ROM.15.16	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that 
ROM.15.17	Therefore in Christ Jesus I have found reason for boasting in things pertaining to God. 
ROM.15.18	For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed, 
ROM.15.19	in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. 
ROM.15.20	And thus I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was 
ROM.15.21	but as it is written,
ROM.15.21	“T
ROM.15.21	A
ROM.15.22	For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you; 
ROM.15.23	but now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you 
ROM.15.24	whenever I go to Spain—for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for a while— 
ROM.15.25	but now, I am going to Jerusalem serving the saints. 
ROM.15.26	For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem. 
ROM.15.27	Yes, they were pleased 
ROM.15.28	Therefore, when I have finished this, and have put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain. 
ROM.15.29	I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.
ROM.15.30	Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me, 
ROM.15.31	that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and 
ROM.15.32	so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and find 
ROM.15.33	Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
ROM.16.1	I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea; 
ROM.16.2	that you receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and that you help her in whatever matter she may have need of you; for she herself has also been a helper of many, and of myself as well.
ROM.16.3	Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, 
ROM.16.4	who for my life risked their own necks, to whom not only do I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles; 
ROM.16.5	also 
ROM.16.6	Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you. 
ROM.16.7	Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners, who are outstanding among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me. 
ROM.16.8	Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord. 
ROM.16.9	Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. 
ROM.16.10	Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the 
ROM.16.11	Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those of the 
ROM.16.12	Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, workers in the Lord. Greet Persis the beloved, who has worked hard in the Lord. 
ROM.16.13	Greet Rufus, a choice man in the Lord, also his mother and mine. 
ROM.16.14	Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the brethren with them. 
ROM.16.15	Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them. 
ROM.16.16	Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.
ROM.16.17	Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn away from them. 
ROM.16.18	For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting. 
ROM.16.19	For the report of your obedience has reached to all; therefore I am rejoicing over you, but I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil. 
ROM.16.20	The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.
ROM.16.21	Timothy my fellow worker greets you, and 
ROM.16.22	I, Tertius, who write this letter, greet you in the Lord.
ROM.16.23	Gaius, host to me and to the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer greets you, and Quartus, the brother. 
ROM.16.24	[
ROM.16.25	Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past, 
ROM.16.26	but now is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, 
ROM.16.27	to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be the glory forever. Amen.
1CO.1.1	Paul, called 
1CO.1.2	To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their 
1CO.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.1.4	I thank 
1CO.1.5	that in everything you were enriched in Him, in all speech and all knowledge, 
1CO.1.6	even as the testimony concerning Christ was confirmed in you, 
1CO.1.7	so that you are not lacking in any gift, awaiting eagerly the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1CO.1.8	who will also confirm you to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1CO.1.9	God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
1CO.1.10	Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment. 
1CO.1.11	For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by Chloe’s 
1CO.1.12	Now I mean this, that each one of you is saying, “I am of Paul,” and “I of Apollos,” and “I of Cephas,” and “I of Christ.” 
1CO.1.13	Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? 
1CO.1.14	I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, 
1CO.1.15	so that no one would say you were baptized in my name. 
1CO.1.16	Now I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any other. 
1CO.1.17	For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in cleverness of speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void.
1CO.1.18	For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 
1CO.1.19	For it is written,
1CO.1.19	“I 
1CO.1.19	A
1CO.1.20	Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 
1CO.1.21	For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not 
1CO.1.22	For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom; 
1CO.1.23	but we preach 
1CO.1.24	but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 
1CO.1.25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
1CO.1.26	For consider your calling, brethren, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble; 
1CO.1.27	but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong, 
1CO.1.28	and the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that He may nullify the things that are, 
1CO.1.29	so that no man may boast before God. 
1CO.1.30	But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption, 
1CO.1.31	so that, just as it is written, “L
1CO.2.1	And when I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the 
1CO.2.2	For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified. 
1CO.2.3	I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling, 
1CO.2.4	and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 
1CO.2.5	so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.
1CO.2.6	Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; 
1CO.2.7	but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden 
1CO.2.8	 which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; 
1CO.2.9	but just as it is written,
1CO.2.9	“T
1CO.2.9	A
1CO.2.9	A
1CO.2.11	For who among men knows the 
1CO.2.12	Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God, 
1CO.2.13	which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual 
1CO.2.14	But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised. 
1CO.2.15	But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one. 
1CO.2.16	For 
1CO.3.1	And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. 
1CO.3.2	I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able 
1CO.3.3	for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men? 
1CO.3.4	For when one says, “I am of Paul,” and another, “I am of Apollos,” are you not 
1CO.3.5	What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave 
1CO.3.6	I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth. 
1CO.3.7	So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth. 
1CO.3.8	Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. 
1CO.3.9	For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.
1CO.3.10	According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it. 
1CO.3.11	For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
1CO.3.12	Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, 
1CO.3.13	each man’s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is 
1CO.3.14	If any man’s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward. 
1CO.3.15	If any man’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.
1CO.3.16	Do you not know that you are a temple of God and 
1CO.3.17	If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.
1CO.3.18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become foolish, so that he may become wise. 
1CO.3.19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. For it is written, “
1CO.3.20	and again, “T
1CO.3.21	So then let no one boast in men. For all things belong to you, 
1CO.3.22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things belong to you, 
1CO.3.23	and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God.
1CO.4.1	Let a man regard us in this manner, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. 
1CO.4.2	In this case, moreover, it is required of stewards that one be found trustworthy. 
1CO.4.3	But to me it is a very small thing that I may be examined by you, or by 
1CO.4.4	For I am conscious of nothing against myself, yet I am not by this acquitted; but the one who examines me is the Lord. 
1CO.4.5	Therefore do not go on passing judgment before 
1CO.4.6	Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in behalf of one against the other. 
1CO.4.7	For who regards you as superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?
1CO.4.8	You are already filled, you have already become rich, you have become kings without us; and indeed, 
1CO.4.9	For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as men condemned to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men. 
1CO.4.10	We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are prudent in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are distinguished, but we are without honor. 
1CO.4.11	To this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty, and are poorly clothed, and are roughly treated, and are homeless; 
1CO.4.12	and we toil, working with our own hands; when we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure; 
1CO.4.13	when we are slandered, we try to conciliate; we have become as the scum of the world, the dregs of all things, 
1CO.4.14	I do not write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children. 
1CO.4.15	For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet 
1CO.4.16	Therefore I exhort you, be imitators of me. 
1CO.4.17	For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church. 
1CO.4.18	Now some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you. 
1CO.4.19	But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I shall find out, not the words of those who are arrogant but their power. 
1CO.4.20	For the kingdom of God does not consist in words but in power. 
1CO.4.21	What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?
1CO.5.1	It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and immorality of such a kind as does not exist even among the Gentiles, that someone has his father’s wife. 
1CO.5.2	You have become arrogant and have not mourned instead, so that the one who had done this deed would be removed from your midst.
1CO.5.3	For I, on my part, though absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged him who has so committed this, as though I were present. 
1CO.5.4	In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and I with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 
1CO.5.5	 to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord 
1CO.5.6	Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump 
1CO.5.7	Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are 
1CO.5.8	Therefore let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
1CO.5.9	I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people; 
1CO.5.10	I 
1CO.5.11	But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler—not even to eat with such a one. 
1CO.5.12	For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Do you not judge those who are within 
1CO.5.13	But those who are outside, God judges. R
1CO.6.1	Does any one of you, when he has a case against his neighbor, dare to go to law before the unrighteous and not before the saints? 
1CO.6.2	Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? If the world is judged by you, are you not competent 
1CO.6.3	Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more matters of this life? 
1CO.6.4	So if you have law courts dealing with matters of this life, do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church? 
1CO.6.5	I say 
1CO.6.6	but brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?
1CO.6.7	Actually, then, it is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded? 
1CO.6.8	On the contrary, you yourselves wrong and defraud. 
1CO.6.9	Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor 
1CO.6.10	nor thieves, nor 
1CO.6.11	Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
1CO.6.12	All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything. 
1CO.6.13	Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body. 
1CO.6.14	Now God has not only raised the Lord, but will also raise us up through His power. 
1CO.6.15	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be! 
1CO.6.16	Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body 
1CO.6.17	But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit 
1CO.6.18	Flee immorality. Every 
1CO.6.19	Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own? 
1CO.6.20	For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.
1CO.7.1	Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman. 
1CO.7.2	But because of immoralities, each man is to have his own wife, and each woman is to have her own husband. 
1CO.7.3	The husband must fulfill his duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband. 
1CO.7.4	The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband 
1CO.7.5	Stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 
1CO.7.6	But this I say by way of concession, not of command. 
1CO.7.7	Yet I wish that all men were even as I myself am. However, each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner, and another in that.
1CO.7.8	But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I. 
1CO.7.9	But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn 
1CO.7.10	But to the married I give instructions, not I, but the Lord, that the wife should not leave her husband 
1CO.7.11	(but if she does leave, she must remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not divorce his wife.
1CO.7.12	But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her. 
1CO.7.13	And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to live with her, she must not send her husband away. 
1CO.7.14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband; for otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy. 
1CO.7.15	Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let him leave; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such 
1CO.7.16	For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?
1CO.7.17	Only, as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each, in this manner let him walk. And so I direct in all the churches. 
1CO.7.18	Was any man called 
1CO.7.19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but 
1CO.7.20	Each man must remain in that condition in which he was called.
1CO.7.21	Were you called while a slave? Do not worry about it; but if you are able also to become free, rather do that. 
1CO.7.22	For he who was called in the Lord while a slave, is the Lord’s freedman; likewise he who was called while free, is Christ’s slave. 
1CO.7.23	You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men. 
1CO.7.24	Brethren, each one is to remain with God in that 
1CO.7.25	Now concerning virgins I have no command of the Lord, but I give an opinion as one who by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy. 
1CO.7.26	I think then that this is good in view of the present distress, that it is good for a man to remain as he is. 
1CO.7.27	Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife. 
1CO.7.28	But if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have trouble in this life, and I am trying to spare you. 
1CO.7.29	But this I say, brethren, the time has been shortened, so that from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none; 
1CO.7.30	and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess; 
1CO.7.31	and those who use the world, as though they did not make full use of it; for the form of this world is passing away.
1CO.7.32	But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; 
1CO.7.33	but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife, 
1CO.7.34	and 
1CO.7.35	This I say for your own benefit; not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is appropriate and 
1CO.7.36	But if any man thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin 
1CO.7.37	But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, but has authority over his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin 
1CO.7.38	So then both he who gives his own virgin 
1CO.7.39	A wife is bound as long as her husband lives; but if her husband is dead, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord. 
1CO.7.40	But in my opinion she is happier if she remains as she is; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
1CO.8.1	Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies. 
1CO.8.2	If anyone supposes that he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know; 
1CO.8.3	but if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.
1CO.8.4	Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that 
1CO.8.5	For even if there are so-called gods whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords, 
1CO.8.6	yet for us there is 
1CO.8.7	However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being accustomed to the idol until now, eat 
1CO.8.8	But food will not commend us to God; we are neither the worse if we do not eat, nor the better if we do eat. 
1CO.8.9	But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. 
1CO.8.10	For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols? 
1CO.8.11	For through your knowledge he who is weak is ruined, the brother for whose sake Christ died. 
1CO.8.12	And so, by sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. 
1CO.8.13	Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to stumble.
1CO.9.1	Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? 
1CO.9.2	If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
1CO.9.3	My defense to those who examine me is this: 
1CO.9.4	Do we not have a right to eat and drink? 
1CO.9.5	Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife, even as the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? 
1CO.9.6	Or do only Barnabas and I not have a right to refrain from working? 
1CO.9.7	Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it? Or who tends a flock and does not use the milk of the flock?
1CO.9.8	I am not speaking these things according to human judgment, am I? Or does not the Law also say these things? 
1CO.9.9	For it is written in the Law of Moses, “Y
1CO.9.10	Or is He speaking altogether for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher 
1CO.9.11	If we sowed spiritual things in you, is it too much if we reap material things from you? 
1CO.9.12	If others share the right over you, do we not more? Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things so that we will cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ. 
1CO.9.13	Do you not know that those who perform sacred services eat the 
1CO.9.14	So also the Lord directed those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel.
1CO.9.15	But I have used none of these things. And I am not writing these things so that it will be done so in my case; for it would be better for me to die than have any man make my boast an empty one. 
1CO.9.16	For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for I am under compulsion; for woe is me if I do not preach the gospel. 
1CO.9.17	For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if against my will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me. 
1CO.9.18	What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may offer the gospel without charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.
1CO.9.19	For though I am free from all 
1CO.9.20	To the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might win Jews; to those who are under the Law, as under the Law though not being myself under the Law, so that I might win those who are under the Law; 
1CO.9.21	to those who are without law, as without law, though not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ, so that I might win those who are without law. 
1CO.9.22	To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have become all things to all men, so that I may by all means save some. 
1CO.9.23	I do all things for the sake of the gospel, so that I may become a fellow partaker of it.
1CO.9.24	Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but 
1CO.9.25	Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then 
1CO.9.26	Therefore I run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air; 
1CO.9.27	but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.
1CO.10.1	For I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea; 
1CO.10.2	and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 
1CO.10.3	and all ate the same spiritual food; 
1CO.10.4	and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ. 
1CO.10.5	Nevertheless, with most of them God was not well-pleased; for they were laid low in the wilderness.
1CO.10.6	Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they also craved. 
1CO.10.7	Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, “T
1CO.10.8	Nor let us act immorally, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day. 
1CO.10.9	Nor let us try the Lord, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the serpents. 
1CO.10.10	Nor grumble, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer. 
1CO.10.11	Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come. 
1CO.10.12	Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed that he does not fall. 
1CO.10.13	No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.
1CO.10.14	Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. 
1CO.10.15	I speak as to wise men; you judge what I say. 
1CO.10.16	Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ? 
1CO.10.17	Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one bread. 
1CO.10.18	Look at the nation Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar? 
1CO.10.19	What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? 
1CO.10.20	 but 
1CO.10.21	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. 
1CO.10.22	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than He, are we?
1CO.10.23	All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful, but not all things edify. 
1CO.10.24	Let no one seek his own 
1CO.10.25	Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without asking questions for conscience’ sake; 
1CO.10.26	 L
1CO.10.27	If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat anything that is set before you without asking questions for conscience’ sake. 
1CO.10.28	But if anyone says to you, “This is meat sacrificed to idols,” do not eat 
1CO.10.29	I mean not your own conscience, but the other 
1CO.10.30	If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks?
1CO.10.31	Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. 
1CO.10.32	Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God; 
1CO.10.33	just as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit but the 
1CO.11.1	Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.
1CO.11.2	Now I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly to the traditions, just as I delivered them to you. 
1CO.11.3	But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ. 
1CO.11.4	Every man who has 
1CO.11.5	But every woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying disgraces her head, for she is one and the same as the woman whose head is shaved. 
1CO.11.6	For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her cover her head. 
1CO.11.7	For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. 
1CO.11.8	For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man; 
1CO.11.9	for indeed man was not created for the woman’s sake, but woman for the man’s sake. 
1CO.11.10	Therefore the woman ought to have 
1CO.11.11	However, in the Lord, neither is woman independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 
1CO.11.12	For as the woman originates from the man, so also the man 
1CO.11.13	Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God 
1CO.11.14	Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him, 
1CO.11.15	but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her for a covering. 
1CO.11.16	But if one is inclined to be contentious, we have no other practice, nor have the churches of God.
1CO.11.17	But in giving this instruction, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse. 
1CO.11.18	For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and in part I believe it. 
1CO.11.19	For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may become evident among you. 
1CO.11.20	Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper, 
1CO.11.21	for in your eating each one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry and another is drunk. 
1CO.11.22	What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you.
1CO.11.23	For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread; 
1CO.11.24	and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, 
1CO.11.25	In the same way 
1CO.11.26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.
1CO.11.27	Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. 
1CO.11.28	But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 
1CO.11.29	For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not judge the body rightly. 
1CO.11.30	For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep. 
1CO.11.31	But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged. 
1CO.11.32	But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.
1CO.11.33	So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. 
1CO.11.34	If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment. The remaining matters I will arrange when I come.
1CO.12.1	Now concerning spiritual 
1CO.12.2	You know that when you were pagans, 
1CO.12.3	Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is accursed”; and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.
1CO.12.4	Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit. 
1CO.12.5	And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord. 
1CO.12.6	There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all 
1CO.12.7	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. 
1CO.12.8	For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit; 
1CO.12.9	to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, 
1CO.12.10	and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another 
1CO.12.11	But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.
1CO.12.12	For even as the body is one and 
1CO.12.13	For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
1CO.12.14	For the body is not one member, but many. 
1CO.12.15	If the foot says, “Because I am not a hand, I am not 
1CO.12.16	And if the ear says, “Because I am not an eye, I am not 
1CO.12.17	If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? 
1CO.12.18	But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired. 
1CO.12.19	If they were all one member, where would the body be? 
1CO.12.20	But now there are many members, but one body. 
1CO.12.21	And the eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you”; or again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” 
1CO.12.22	On the contrary, it is much truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary; 
1CO.12.23	and those 
1CO.12.24	whereas our more presentable members have no need 
1CO.12.25	so that there may be no division in the body, but 
1CO.12.26	And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if 
1CO.12.27	Now you are Christ’s body, and individually members of it. 
1CO.12.28	And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, 
1CO.12.29	All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not 
1CO.12.30	All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they? 
1CO.12.31	But earnestly desire the greater gifts.
1CO.13.1	If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 
1CO.13.2	If I have 
1CO.13.3	And if I give all my possessions to feed 
1CO.13.4	Love is patient, love is kind 
1CO.13.5	does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong 
1CO.13.6	does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; 
1CO.13.7	bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
1CO.13.8	Love never fails; but if 
1CO.13.9	For we know in part and we prophesy in part; 
1CO.13.10	but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away. 
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things. 
1CO.13.12	For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known. 
1CO.13.13	But now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the greatest of these is love.
1CO.14.1	Pursue love, yet desire earnestly spiritual 
1CO.14.2	For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God; for no one understands, but in 
1CO.14.3	But one who prophesies speaks to men for edification and exhortation and consolation. 
1CO.14.4	One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but one who prophesies edifies the church. 
1CO.14.5	Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but 
1CO.14.6	But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you unless I speak to you either by way of revelation or of knowledge or of prophecy or of teaching? 
1CO.14.7	Yet 
1CO.14.8	For if the bugle produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare himself for battle? 
1CO.14.9	So also you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that is clear, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air. 
1CO.14.10	There are, perhaps, a great many kinds of languages in the world, and no 
1CO.14.11	If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be to the one who speaks a barbarian, and the one who speaks will be a barbarian to me. 
1CO.14.12	So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual 
1CO.14.13	Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret. 
1CO.14.14	For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. 
1CO.14.15	What is 
1CO.14.16	Otherwise if you bless in the spirit 
1CO.14.17	For you are giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not edified. 
1CO.14.18	I thank God, I speak in tongues more than you all; 
1CO.14.19	however, in the church I desire to speak five words with my mind so that I may instruct others also, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.
1CO.14.20	Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; yet in evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature. 
1CO.14.21	In the Law it is written, “B
1CO.14.22	So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophecy 
1CO.14.23	Therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and ungifted men or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad? 
1CO.14.24	But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all; 
1CO.14.25	the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so he will fall on his face and worship God, declaring that God is certainly among you.
1CO.14.26	What is 
1CO.14.27	If anyone speaks in a tongue, 
1CO.14.28	but if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God. 
1CO.14.29	Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others pass judgment. 
1CO.14.30	But if a revelation is made to another who is seated, the first one must keep silent. 
1CO.14.31	For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be exhorted; 
1CO.14.32	and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets; 
1CO.14.33	for God is not 
1CO.14.34	The women are to keep silent in the churches; for they are not permitted to speak, but are to subject themselves, just as the Law also says. 
1CO.14.35	If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to speak in church. 
1CO.14.36	Was it from you that the word of God 
1CO.14.37	If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord’s commandment. 
1CO.14.38	But if anyone does not recognize 
1CO.14.39	Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in tongues. 
1CO.14.40	But all things must be done properly and in an orderly manner.
1CO.15.1	Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, 
1CO.15.2	by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.
1CO.15.3	For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 
1CO.15.4	and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 
1CO.15.5	and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. 
1CO.15.6	After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep; 
1CO.15.7	then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles; 
1CO.15.8	and last of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me also. 
1CO.15.9	For I am the least of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
1CO.15.10	But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me. 
1CO.15.11	Whether then 
1CO.15.12	Now if Christ is preached, that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
1CO.15.13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has been raised; 
1CO.15.14	and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your faith also is vain. 
1CO.15.15	Moreover we are even found 
1CO.15.16	For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised; 
1CO.15.17	and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins. 
1CO.15.18	Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. 
1CO.15.19	If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most to be pitied.
1CO.15.20	But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep. 
1CO.15.21	For since by a man 
1CO.15.22	For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive. 
1CO.15.23	But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those who are Christ’s at His coming, 
1CO.15.24	then 
1CO.15.25	For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. 
1CO.15.26	The last enemy that will be abolished is death. 
1CO.15.27	For H
1CO.15.28	When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all.
1CO.15.29	Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them? 
1CO.15.30	Why are we also in danger every hour? 
1CO.15.31	I affirm, brethren, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. 
1CO.15.32	If from human motives I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, 
1CO.15.33	Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.” 
1CO.15.34	Become sober-minded as you ought, and stop sinning; for some have no knowledge of God. I speak 
1CO.15.35	But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?” 
1CO.15.36	You fool! That which you sow does not come to life unless it dies; 
1CO.15.37	and that which you sow, you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else. 
1CO.15.38	But God gives it a body just as He wished, and to each of the seeds a body of its own. 
1CO.15.39	All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one 
1CO.15.40	There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the 
1CO.15.41	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
1CO.15.42	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable 
1CO.15.43	it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; 
1CO.15.44	it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual 
1CO.15.45	So also it is written, “The first 
1CO.15.46	However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual. 
1CO.15.47	The first man is from the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven. 
1CO.15.48	As is the earthy, so also are those who are earthy; and as is the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly. 
1CO.15.49	Just as we have borne the image of the earthy, 
1CO.15.50	Now I say this, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. 
1CO.15.51	Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, 
1CO.15.52	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 
1CO.15.53	For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality. 
1CO.15.54	But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come about the saying that is written, “D
1CO.15.55	O 
1CO.15.56	The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; 
1CO.15.57	but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.15.58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not 
1CO.16.1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also. 
1CO.16.2	On the first day of every week each one of you is to put aside and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I come. 
1CO.16.3	When I arrive, whomever you may approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem; 
1CO.16.4	and if it is fitting for me to go also, they will go with me.
1CO.16.5	But I will come to you after I go through Macedonia, for I am going through Macedonia; 
1CO.16.6	and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I may go. 
1CO.16.7	For I do not wish to see you now 
1CO.16.8	But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost; 
1CO.16.9	for a wide door for effective 
1CO.16.10	Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without cause to be afraid, for he is doing the Lord’s work, as I also am. 
1CO.16.11	So let no one despise him. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren.
1CO.16.12	But concerning Apollos our brother, I encouraged him greatly to come to you with the brethren; and it was not at all 
1CO.16.13	Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. 
1CO.16.14	Let all that you do be done in love.
1CO.16.15	Now I urge you, brethren (you know the household of Stephanas, that they were the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves for ministry to the saints), 
1CO.16.16	that you also be in subjection to such men and to everyone who helps in the work and labors. 
1CO.16.17	I rejoice over the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking on your part. 
1CO.16.18	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men.
1CO.16.19	The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. 
1CO.16.20	All the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1CO.16.21	The greeting is in my own hand—Paul. 
1CO.16.22	If anyone does not love the Lord, he is to be accursed. Maranatha. 
1CO.16.23	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. 
1CO.16.24	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2CO.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy 
2CO.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2CO.1.3	Blessed 
2CO.1.4	who comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. 
2CO.1.5	For just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ. 
2CO.1.6	But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer; 
2CO.1.7	and our hope for you is firmly grounded, knowing that as you are sharers of our sufferings, so also you are 
2CO.1.8	For we do not want you to be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came 
2CO.1.9	indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; 
2CO.1.10	who delivered us from so great a 
2CO.1.11	you also joining in helping us through your prayers, so that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the favor bestowed on us through 
2CO.1.12	For our proud confidence is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you. 
2CO.1.13	For we write nothing else to you than what you read and understand, and I hope you will understand until the end; 
2CO.1.14	just as you also partially did understand us, that we are your reason to be proud as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
2CO.1.15	In this confidence I intended at first to come to you, so that you might twice receive a blessing; 
2CO.1.16	that is, to pass your way into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be helped on my journey to Judea. 
2CO.1.17	Therefore, I was not vacillating when I intended to do this, was I? Or what I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that with me there will be yes, yes and no, no 
2CO.1.18	But as God is faithful, our word to you is not yes and no. 
2CO.1.19	For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you by us—by me and Silvanus and Timothy—was not yes and no, but is yes in Him. 
2CO.1.20	For as many as are the promises of God, in Him they are yes; therefore also through Him is our Amen to the glory of God through us. 
2CO.1.21	Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God, 
2CO.1.22	who also sealed us and gave 
2CO.1.23	But I call God as witness to my soul, that to spare you I did not come again to Corinth. 
2CO.1.24	Not that we lord it over your faith, but are workers with you for your joy; for in your faith you are standing firm.
2CO.2.1	But I determined this for my own sake, that I would not come to you in sorrow again. 
2CO.2.2	For if I cause you sorrow, who then makes me glad but the one whom I made sorrowful? 
2CO.2.3	This is the very thing I wrote you, so that when I came, I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice; having confidence in you all that my joy would be 
2CO.2.4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not so that you would be made sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have especially for you.
2CO.2.5	But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not to me, but in some degree—in order not to say too much—to all of you. 
2CO.2.6	Sufficient for such a one is this punishment which 
2CO.2.7	so that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort 
2CO.2.8	Wherefore I urge you to reaffirm 
2CO.2.9	For to this end also I wrote, so that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things. 
2CO.2.10	But one whom you forgive anything, I 
2CO.2.11	so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.
2CO.2.12	Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord, 
2CO.2.13	I had no rest for my spirit, not finding Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went on to Macedonia.
2CO.2.14	But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and manifests through us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place. 
2CO.2.15	For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing; 
2CO.2.16	to the one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is adequate for these things? 
2CO.2.17	For we are not like many, 
2CO.3.1	Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some, letters of commendation to you or from you? 
2CO.3.2	You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men; 
2CO.3.3	being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
2CO.3.4	Such confidence we have through Christ toward God. 
2CO.3.5	Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as 
2CO.3.6	who also made us adequate 
2CO.3.7	But if the ministry of death, in letters engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, fading 
2CO.3.8	how will the ministry of the Spirit fail to be even more with glory? 
2CO.3.9	For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory. 
2CO.3.10	For indeed what had glory, in this case has no glory because of the glory that surpasses 
2CO.3.11	For if that which fades away 
2CO.3.12	Therefore having such a hope, we use great boldness in 
2CO.3.13	and 
2CO.3.14	But their minds were hardened; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is removed in Christ. 
2CO.3.15	But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their heart; 
2CO.3.16	but whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. 
2CO.3.17	Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, 
2CO.3.18	But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.
2CO.4.1	Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we received mercy, we do not lose heart, 
2CO.4.2	but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God. 
2CO.4.3	And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, 
2CO.4.4	in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 
2CO.4.5	For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants for Jesus’ sake. 
2CO.4.6	For God, who said, “Light shall shine out of darkness,” is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
2CO.4.7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the surpassing greatness of the power will be of God and not from ourselves; 
2CO.4.8	 afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing; 
2CO.4.9	persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; 
2CO.4.10	always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. 
2CO.4.11	For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. 
2CO.4.12	So death works in us, but life in you.
2CO.4.13	But having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, “I 
2CO.4.14	knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will present us with you. 
2CO.4.15	For all things 
2CO.4.16	Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day. 
2CO.4.17	For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison, 
2CO.4.18	while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
2CO.5.1	For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 
2CO.5.2	For indeed in this 
2CO.5.3	inasmuch as we, having put it on, will not be found naked. 
2CO.5.4	For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that what is mortal will be swallowed up by life. 
2CO.5.5	Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge.
2CO.5.6	Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord— 
2CO.5.7	for we walk by faith, not by sight— 
2CO.5.8	we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord. 
2CO.5.9	Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him. 
2CO.5.10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.
2CO.5.11	Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences. 
2CO.5.12	We are not again commending ourselves to you but 
2CO.5.13	For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you. 
2CO.5.14	For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died; 
2CO.5.15	and He died for all, so that they who live might no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose again on their behalf.
2CO.5.16	Therefore from now on we recognize no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know 
2CO.5.17	Therefore if anyone is in Christ, 
2CO.5.18	Now all 
2CO.5.19	namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.
2CO.5.20	Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. 
2CO.5.21	He made Him who knew no sin 
2CO.6.1	And working together 
2CO.6.2	for He says,
2CO.6.2	“A
2CO.6.2	A
2CO.6.2	Behold, now is “
2CO.6.3	giving no cause for offense in anything, so that the ministry will not be discredited, 
2CO.6.4	but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, 
2CO.6.5	in beatings, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger, 
2CO.6.6	in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love, 
2CO.6.7	in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left, 
2CO.6.8	by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; 
2CO.6.9	as unknown yet well-known, as dying yet behold, we live; as punished yet not put to death, 
2CO.6.10	as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing yet possessing all things.
2CO.6.11	Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our heart is opened wide. 
2CO.6.12	You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your own affections. 
2CO.6.13	Now in a like exchange—I speak as to children—open wide 
2CO.6.14	Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness? 
2CO.6.15	Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? 
2CO.6.16	Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said,
2CO.6.16	“I 
2CO.6.16	A
2CO.6.17	Therefore, 
2CO.6.17	“A
2CO.6.17	And I will welcome you.
2CO.6.18	And I will be a father to you,
2CO.6.18	And you shall be sons and daughters to Me,”
2CO.6.18	Says the Lord Almighty.
2CO.7.1	Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
2CO.7.2	Make room for us 
2CO.7.3	I do not speak to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together. 
2CO.7.4	Great is my confidence in you; great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction.
2CO.7.5	For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted on every side: conflicts without, fears within. 
2CO.7.6	But God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the coming of Titus; 
2CO.7.7	and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced even more. 
2CO.7.8	For though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it—
2CO.7.9	I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to 
2CO.7.10	For the sorrow that is according to 
2CO.7.11	For behold what earnestness this very thing, this godly sorrow, has produced in you: what vindication of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what avenging of wrong! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter. 
2CO.7.12	So although I wrote to you, 
2CO.7.13	For this reason we have been comforted.
2CO.7.14	For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, so also our boasting before Titus proved to be 
2CO.7.15	His affection abounds all the more toward you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling. 
2CO.7.16	I rejoice that in everything I have confidence in you.
2CO.8.1	Now, brethren, we 
2CO.8.2	that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality. 
2CO.8.3	For I testify that according to their ability, and beyond their ability, 
2CO.8.4	begging us with much urging for the favor of participation in the support of the saints, 
2CO.8.5	and 
2CO.8.6	So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning, so he would also complete in you this gracious work as well.
2CO.8.7	But just as you abound in everything, in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the 
2CO.8.8	I am not speaking 
2CO.8.9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich. 
2CO.8.10	I give 
2CO.8.11	But now finish doing it also, so that just as 
2CO.8.12	For if the readiness is present, it is acceptable according to what 
2CO.8.13	For 
2CO.8.14	at this present time your abundance 
2CO.8.15	as it is written, “H
2CO.8.16	But thanks be to God who puts the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus. 
2CO.8.17	For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest, he has gone to you of his own accord. 
2CO.8.18	We have sent along with him the brother whose fame in 
2CO.8.19	and not only 
2CO.8.20	taking precaution so that no one will discredit us in our administration of this generous gift; 
2CO.8.21	for we have regard for what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 
2CO.8.22	We have sent with them our brother, whom we have often tested and found diligent in many things, but now even more diligent because of 
2CO.8.23	As for Titus, 
2CO.8.24	Therefore openly before the churches, show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you.
2CO.9.1	For it is superfluous for me to write to you about this ministry to the saints; 
2CO.9.2	for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, 
2CO.9.3	But I have sent the brethren, in order that our boasting about you may not be made empty in this case, so that, as I was saying, you may be prepared; 
2CO.9.4	otherwise if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to speak of you—will be put to shame by this confidence. 
2CO.9.5	So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren that they would go on ahead to you and arrange beforehand your previously promised bountiful gift, so that the same would be ready as a bountiful gift and not affected by covetousness.
2CO.9.6	Now this 
2CO.9.7	Each one 
2CO.9.8	And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed; 
2CO.9.9	as it is written,
2CO.9.9	“H
2CO.9.9	H
2CO.9.10	Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness; 
2CO.9.11	you will be enriched in everything for all liberality, which through us is producing thanksgiving to God. 
2CO.9.12	For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God. 
2CO.9.13	Because of the proof given by this ministry, they will glorify God for 
2CO.9.14	while they also, by prayer on your behalf, yearn for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you. 
2CO.9.15	Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!
2CO.10.1	Now I, Paul, myself urge you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ—I who am meek when face to face with you, but bold toward you when absent! 
2CO.10.2	I ask that when I am present I 
2CO.10.3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh, 
2CO.10.4	for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. 
2CO.10.5	 destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and 
2CO.10.6	and we are ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete.
2CO.10.7	You are looking at things as they are outwardly. If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again within himself, that just as he is Christ’s, so also are we. 
2CO.10.8	For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not be put to shame, 
2CO.10.9	for I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters. 
2CO.10.10	For they say, “His letters are weighty and strong, but his personal presence is unimpressive and his speech contemptible.” 
2CO.10.11	Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when absent, such persons 
2CO.10.12	For we are not bold to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves; but when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding. 
2CO.10.13	But we will not boast beyond 
2CO.10.14	For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach to you, for we were the first to come even as far as you in the gospel of Christ; 
2CO.10.15	not boasting beyond 
2CO.10.16	so as to preach the gospel even to the regions beyond you, 
2CO.10.17	But 
2CO.10.18	For it is not he who commends himself that is approved, but he whom the Lord commends.
2CO.11.1	I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness; but indeed you are bearing with me. 
2CO.11.2	For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I betrothed you to one husband, so that to Christ I might present you 
2CO.11.3	But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity 
2CO.11.4	For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted, you bear 
2CO.11.5	For I consider myself not in the least inferior to the most eminent apostles. 
2CO.11.6	But even if I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not 
2CO.11.7	Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge? 
2CO.11.8	I robbed other churches by taking wages 
2CO.11.9	and when I was present with you and was in need, I was not a burden to anyone; for when the brethren came from Macedonia they fully supplied my need, and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and will continue to do so. 
2CO.11.10	As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia. 
2CO.11.11	Why? Because I do not love you? God knows 
2CO.11.12	But what I am doing I will continue to do, so that I may cut off opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the matter about which they are boasting. 
2CO.11.13	For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 
2CO.11.14	No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 
2CO.11.15	Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds.
2CO.11.16	Again I say, let no one think me foolish; but if 
2CO.11.17	What I am saying, I am not saying as the Lord would, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting. 
2CO.11.18	Since many boast according to the flesh, I will boast also. 
2CO.11.19	For you, being 
2CO.11.20	For you tolerate it if anyone enslaves you, anyone devours you, anyone takes advantage of you, anyone exalts himself, anyone hits you in the face. 
2CO.11.21	To 
2CO.11.22	Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. 
2CO.11.23	Are they servants of Christ?—I speak as if insane—I more so; in far more labors, in far more imprisonments, beaten times without number, often in danger of death. 
2CO.11.24	Five times I received from the Jews thirty-nine 
2CO.11.25	Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep. 
2CO.11.26	 on frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from 
2CO.11.27	 in labor and hardship, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. 
2CO.11.28	Apart from 
2CO.11.29	Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?
2CO.11.30	If I have to boast, I will boast of what pertains to my weakness. 
2CO.11.31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, He who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying. 
2CO.11.32	In Damascus the ethnarch under Aretas the king was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me, 
2CO.11.33	and I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and 
2CO.12.1	Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
2CO.12.2	I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven. 
2CO.12.3	And I know how such a man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows— 
2CO.12.4	was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man is not permitted to speak. 
2CO.12.5	On behalf of such a man I will boast; but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in regard to 
2CO.12.6	For if I do wish to boast I will not be foolish, for I will be speaking the truth; but I refrain 
2CO.12.7	Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from exalting myself! 
2CO.12.8	Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me. 
2CO.12.9	And He has said to me, 
2CO.12.10	Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ’s sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.
2CO.12.11	I have become foolish; you yourselves compelled me. Actually I should have been commended by you, for in no respect was I inferior to the most eminent apostles, even though I am a nobody. 
2CO.12.12	The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles. 
2CO.12.13	For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not become a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!
2CO.12.14	Here for this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I do not seek what is yours, but you; for children are not responsible to save up for 
2CO.12.15	I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less? 
2CO.12.16	But be that as it may, I did not burden you myself; nevertheless, crafty fellow that I am, I took you in by deceit. 
2CO.12.17	 I have not taken advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you, have I? 
2CO.12.18	I urged Titus 
2CO.12.19	All this time you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. 
2CO.12.20	For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you to be not what I wish and may be found by you to be not what you wish; that perhaps 
2CO.12.21	I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity, immorality and sensuality which they have practiced.
2CO.13.1	This is the third time I am coming to you. E
2CO.13.2	I have previously said when present the second time, and though now absent I say in advance to those who have sinned in the past and to all the rest 
2CO.13.3	since you are seeking for proof of the Christ who speaks in me, and who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you. 
2CO.13.4	For indeed He was crucified because of weakness, yet He lives because of the power of God. For we also are weak 
2CO.13.5	Test yourselves 
2CO.13.6	But I trust that you will realize that we ourselves do not fail the test. 
2CO.13.7	Now we pray to God that you do no wrong; not that we ourselves may appear approved, but that you may do what is right, even though we may appear unapproved. 
2CO.13.8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but 
2CO.13.9	For we rejoice when we ourselves are weak but you are strong; this we also pray for, that you be made complete. 
2CO.13.10	For this reason I am writing these things while absent, so that when present I 
2CO.13.11	Finally, brethren, rejoice, be made complete, be comforted, be like-minded, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you. 
2CO.13.12	Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
2CO.13.13	All the saints greet you.
2CO.13.14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.
GAL.1.1	Paul, an apostle (not 
GAL.1.2	and all the brethren who are with me,
GAL.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, 
GAL.1.4	who gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, 
GAL.1.5	to whom 
GAL.1.6	I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel; 
GAL.1.7	which is 
GAL.1.8	But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed! 
GAL.1.9	As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed!
GAL.1.10	For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ.
GAL.1.11	For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. 
GAL.1.12	For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but 
GAL.1.13	For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it; 
GAL.1.14	and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions. 
GAL.1.15	But when God, who had set me apart 
GAL.1.16	to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood, 
GAL.1.17	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus.
GAL.1.18	Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him fifteen days. 
GAL.1.19	But I did not see any other of the apostles except James, the Lord’s brother. 
GAL.1.20	(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.) 
GAL.1.21	Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 
GAL.1.22	I was 
GAL.1.23	but only, they kept hearing, “He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith which he once tried to destroy.” 
GAL.1.24	And they were glorifying God because of me.
GAL.2.1	Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also. 
GAL.2.2	It was because of a revelation that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but 
GAL.2.3	But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. 
GAL.2.4	But 
GAL.2.5	But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you. 
GAL.2.6	But from those who were of high reputation (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)—well, those who were of reputation contributed nothing to me. 
GAL.2.7	But on the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter 
GAL.2.8	(for He who effectually worked for Peter in 
GAL.2.9	and recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we 
GAL.2.10	 only 
GAL.2.11	But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. 
GAL.2.12	For prior to the coming of certain men from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he 
GAL.2.13	The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy. 
GAL.2.14	But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, “If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how 
GAL.2.15	“We 
GAL.2.16	nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified. 
GAL.2.17	But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have also been found sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? May it never be! 
GAL.2.18	For if I rebuild what I have 
GAL.2.19	For through the Law I died to the Law, so that I might live to God. 
GAL.2.20	I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the 
GAL.2.21	I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness 
GAL.3.1	You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed 
GAL.3.2	This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith? 
GAL.3.3	Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? 
GAL.3.4	Did you suffer so many things in vain—if indeed it was in vain? 
GAL.3.5	So then, does He who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?
GAL.3.6	Even so Abraham 
GAL.3.7	Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham. 
GAL.3.8	The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, 
GAL.3.9	So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer.
GAL.3.10	For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse; for it is written, “C
GAL.3.11	Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, “T
GAL.3.12	However, the Law is not of faith; on the contrary, “H
GAL.3.13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us—for it is written, “C
GAL.3.14	in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
GAL.3.15	Brethren, I speak in terms of human relations: even though it is 
GAL.3.16	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, “And to seeds,” as 
GAL.3.17	What I am saying is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise. 
GAL.3.18	For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise.
GAL.3.19	Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made. 
GAL.3.20	Now a mediator is not for one 
GAL.3.21	Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given which was able to impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been based on law. 
GAL.3.22	But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
GAL.3.23	But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed. 
GAL.3.24	Therefore the Law has become our tutor 
GAL.3.25	But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. 
GAL.3.26	For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. 
GAL.3.27	For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. 
GAL.3.28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 
GAL.3.29	And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s descendants, heirs according to promise.
GAL.4.1	Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he does not differ at all from a slave although he is owner of everything, 
GAL.4.2	but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by the father. 
GAL.4.3	So also we, while we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental things of the world. 
GAL.4.4	But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law, 
GAL.4.5	so that He might redeem those who were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons. 
GAL.4.6	Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!” 
GAL.4.7	Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.
GAL.4.8	However at that time, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods. 
GAL.4.9	But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things, to which you desire to be enslaved all over again? 
GAL.4.10	You observe days and months and seasons and years. 
GAL.4.11	I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.
GAL.4.12	I beg of you, brethren, become as I 
GAL.4.13	but you know that it was because of a bodily illness that I preached the gospel to you the first time; 
GAL.4.14	and that which was a trial to you in my bodily condition you did not despise or loathe, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus 
GAL.4.15	Where then is that sense of blessing you had? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. 
GAL.4.16	So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth? 
GAL.4.17	They eagerly seek you, not commendably, but they wish to shut you out so that you will seek them. 
GAL.4.18	But it is good always to be eagerly sought in a commendable manner, and not only when I am present with you. 
GAL.4.19	My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you— 
GAL.4.20	but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
GAL.4.21	Tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not listen to the law? 
GAL.4.22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondwoman and one by the free woman. 
GAL.4.23	But the son by the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise. 
GAL.4.24	This is allegorically speaking, for these 
GAL.4.25	Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. 
GAL.4.26	But the Jerusalem above is free; she is our mother. 
GAL.4.27	For it is written,
GAL.4.27	“R
GAL.4.27	B
GAL.4.27	F
GAL.4.27	T
GAL.4.28	And you brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise. 
GAL.4.29	But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him 
GAL.4.30	But what does the Scripture say?
GAL.4.30	“C
GAL.4.30	F
GAL.4.31	So then, brethren, we are not children of a bondwoman, but of the free woman.
GAL.5.1	It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.
GAL.5.2	Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you. 
GAL.5.3	And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law. 
GAL.5.4	You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace. 
GAL.5.5	For we through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness. 
GAL.5.6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love.
GAL.5.7	You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth? 
GAL.5.8	This persuasion 
GAL.5.9	A little leaven leavens the whole lump 
GAL.5.10	I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt no other view; but the one who is disturbing you will bear his judgment, whoever he is. 
GAL.5.11	But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished. 
GAL.5.12	I wish that those who are troubling you would even mutilate themselves.
GAL.5.13	For you were called to freedom, brethren; only 
GAL.5.14	For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the 
GAL.5.15	But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.
GAL.5.16	But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. 
GAL.5.17	For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please. 
GAL.5.18	But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law. 
GAL.5.19	Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, 
GAL.5.20	idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, 
GAL.5.21	envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 
GAL.5.22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
GAL.5.23	gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. 
GAL.5.24	Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
GAL.5.25	If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. 
GAL.5.26	Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one another.
GAL.6.1	Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; 
GAL.6.2	Bear one another’s burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ. 
GAL.6.3	For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 
GAL.6.4	But each one must examine his own work, and then he will have 
GAL.6.5	For each one will bear his own load.
GAL.6.6	The one who is taught the word is to share all good things with the one who teaches 
GAL.6.7	Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap. 
GAL.6.8	For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. 
GAL.6.9	Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary. 
GAL.6.10	So then, while we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith.
GAL.6.11	See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand. 
GAL.6.12	Those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised, simply so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 
GAL.6.13	For those who 
GAL.6.14	But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 
GAL.6.15	For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. 
GAL.6.16	And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy 
GAL.6.17	From now on let no one cause trouble for me, for I bear on my body the brand-marks of Jesus.
GAL.6.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
EPH.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
EPH.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.1.3	Blessed 
EPH.1.4	just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before 
EPH.1.5	He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, 
EPH.1.6	to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. 
EPH.1.7	In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace 
EPH.1.8	which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight 
EPH.1.9	He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him 
EPH.1.10	with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times, 
EPH.1.11	also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will, 
EPH.1.12	to the end that we who were the first to hope in 
EPH.1.13	In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, 
EPH.1.14	who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of 
EPH.1.15	For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which 
EPH.1.16	do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention 
EPH.1.17	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him. 
EPH.1.18	 the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, 
EPH.1.19	and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. 
EPH.1.20	which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly 
EPH.1.21	far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. 
EPH.1.22	And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church, 
EPH.1.23	which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
EPH.2.1	And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, 
EPH.2.2	in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. 
EPH.2.3	Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest. 
EPH.2.4	But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 
EPH.2.5	even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together 
EPH.2.6	and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly 
EPH.2.7	so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 
EPH.2.8	For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, 
EPH.2.9	not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. 
EPH.2.10	For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.
EPH.2.11	Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called “Uncircumcision” by the so-called “Circumcision,” 
EPH.2.12	 that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 
EPH.2.13	But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 
EPH.2.14	For He Himself is our peace, who made both 
EPH.2.15	by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, 
EPH.2.16	and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity. 
EPH.2.17	A
EPH.2.18	for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father. 
EPH.2.19	So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household, 
EPH.2.20	having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner 
EPH.2.21	in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, 
EPH.2.22	in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.
EPH.3.1	For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles— 
EPH.3.2	if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace which was given to me for you; 
EPH.3.3	that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. 
EPH.3.4	By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 
EPH.3.5	which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; 
EPH.3.6	 that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, 
EPH.3.7	of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God’s grace which was given to me according to the working of His power. 
EPH.3.8	To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ, 
EPH.3.9	and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things; 
EPH.3.10	so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly 
EPH.3.11	 in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, 
EPH.3.12	in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him. 
EPH.3.13	Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, for they are your glory.
EPH.3.14	For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, 
EPH.3.15	from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, 
EPH.3.16	that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, 
EPH.3.17	so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; 
EPH.3.18	may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 
EPH.3.19	and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.
EPH.3.20	Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, 
EPH.3.21	to Him 
EPH.4.1	Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, 
EPH.4.2	with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, 
EPH.4.3	being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 
EPH.4.4	 one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; 
EPH.4.5	one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
EPH.4.6	one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.
EPH.4.7	But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift. 
EPH.4.8	Therefore it says,
EPH.4.8	“W
EPH.4.8	H
EPH.4.8	A
EPH.4.9	(Now this 
EPH.4.10	He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.) 
EPH.4.11	And He gave some 
EPH.4.12	for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; 
EPH.4.13	until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. 
EPH.4.14	As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; 
EPH.4.15	but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all 
EPH.4.16	from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.
EPH.4.17	So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind, 
EPH.4.18	being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; 
EPH.4.19	and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. 
EPH.4.20	But you did not learn Christ in this way, 
EPH.4.21	if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, 
EPH.4.22	that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, 
EPH.4.23	and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 
EPH.4.24	and put on the new self, which in 
EPH.4.25	Therefore, laying aside falsehood, 
EPH.4.26	B
EPH.4.27	and do not give the devil an opportunity. 
EPH.4.28	He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have 
EPH.4.29	Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such 
EPH.4.30	Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 
EPH.4.31	Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. 
EPH.4.32	Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven 
EPH.5.1	Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; 
EPH.5.2	and walk in love, just as Christ also loved 
EPH.5.3	But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints; 
EPH.5.4	and 
EPH.5.5	For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
EPH.5.6	Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. 
EPH.5.7	Therefore do not be partakers with them; 
EPH.5.8	for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light 
EPH.5.9	(for the fruit of the Light 
EPH.5.10	trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. 
EPH.5.11	Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them; 
EPH.5.12	for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret. 
EPH.5.13	But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light. 
EPH.5.14	For this reason it says,
EPH.5.14	“Awake, sleeper,
EPH.5.14	And arise from the dead,
EPH.5.14	And Christ will shine on you.”
EPH.5.15	Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, 
EPH.5.16	making the most of your time, because the days are evil. 
EPH.5.17	So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. 
EPH.5.18	And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit, 
EPH.5.19	speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; 
EPH.5.20	always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father; 
EPH.5.21	and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
EPH.5.22	Wives, 
EPH.5.23	For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself 
EPH.5.24	But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives 
EPH.5.25	Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, 
EPH.5.26	so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, 
EPH.5.27	that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless. 
EPH.5.28	So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; 
EPH.5.29	for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also 
EPH.5.30	because we are members of His body. 
EPH.5.31	F
EPH.5.32	This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church. 
EPH.5.33	Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must 
EPH.6.1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 
EPH.6.2	H
EPH.6.3	, 
EPH.6.4	Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
EPH.6.5	Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ; 
EPH.6.6	not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. 
EPH.6.7	With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men, 
EPH.6.8	knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.
EPH.6.9	And masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him.
EPH.6.10	Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might. 
EPH.6.11	Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. 
EPH.6.12	For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual 
EPH.6.13	Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. 
EPH.6.14	Stand firm therefore, 
EPH.6.15	and having shod 
EPH.6.16	in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil 
EPH.6.17	And take 
EPH.6.18	With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints, 
EPH.6.19	and 
EPH.6.20	for which I am an ambassador in chains; that 
EPH.6.21	But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you. 
EPH.6.22	I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts.
EPH.6.23	Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
EPH.6.24	Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible 
PHP.1.1	Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus,
PHP.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.3	I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, 
PHP.1.4	always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all, 
PHP.1.5	in view of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now. 
PHP.1.6	 confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus. 
PHP.1.7	For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me. 
PHP.1.8	For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus. 
PHP.1.9	And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment, 
PHP.1.10	so that you may approve the things that are excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ; 
PHP.1.11	having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which 
PHP.1.12	Now I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel, 
PHP.1.13	so that my imprisonment in 
PHP.1.14	and that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear. 
PHP.1.15	Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ even from envy and strife, but some also from good will; 
PHP.1.16	the latter 
PHP.1.17	the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition rather than from pure motives, thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment. 
PHP.1.18	What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice.
PHP.1.19	for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
PHP.1.20	according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will not be put to shame in anything, but 
PHP.1.21	For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. 
PHP.1.22	But if 
PHP.1.23	But I am hard-pressed from both 
PHP.1.24	yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake. 
PHP.1.25	Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith, 
PHP.1.26	so that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again.
PHP.1.27	Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 
PHP.1.28	in no way alarmed by 
PHP.1.29	For to you it has been granted for Christ’s sake, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake, 
PHP.1.30	experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear 
PHP.2.1	Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, 
PHP.2.2	make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. 
PHP.2.3	Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; 
PHP.2.4	do not 
PHP.2.5	Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, 
PHP.2.6	who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, 
PHP.2.7	but 
PHP.2.8	Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. 
PHP.2.9	For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, 
PHP.2.10	so that at the name of Jesus 
PHP.2.11	and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
PHP.2.12	So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling; 
PHP.2.13	for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for 
PHP.2.14	Do all things without grumbling or disputing; 
PHP.2.15	so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world, 
PHP.2.16	holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain. 
PHP.2.17	But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. 
PHP.2.18	You too, 
PHP.2.19	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition. 
PHP.2.20	For I have no one 
PHP.2.21	For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus. 
PHP.2.22	But you know of his proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child 
PHP.2.23	Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things 
PHP.2.24	and I trust in the Lord that I myself also will be coming shortly. 
PHP.2.25	But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need; 
PHP.2.26	because he was longing 
PHP.2.27	For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow. 
PHP.2.28	Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned 
PHP.2.29	Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high regard; 
PHP.2.30	because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me.
PHP.3.1	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things 
PHP.3.2	Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision; 
PHP.3.3	for we are the 
PHP.3.4	although I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh, I far more: 
PHP.3.5	circumcised the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the Law, a Pharisee; 
PHP.3.6	as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to the righteousness which is in the Law, found blameless.
PHP.3.7	But whatever things were gain to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ. 
PHP.3.8	More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, 
PHP.3.9	and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from 
PHP.3.10	that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death; 
PHP.3.11	in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
PHP.3.12	Not that I have already obtained 
PHP.3.13	Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of 
PHP.3.14	I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 
PHP.3.15	Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you; 
PHP.3.16	however, let us keep living by that same 
PHP.3.17	Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us. 
PHP.3.18	For many walk, of whom I often told you, and now tell you even weeping, 
PHP.3.19	whose end is destruction, whose god is 
PHP.3.20	For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; 
PHP.3.21	who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.
PHP.4.1	Therefore, my beloved brethren whom I long 
PHP.4.2	I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to live in harmony in the Lord. 
PHP.4.3	Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to help these women who have shared my struggle in 
PHP.4.4	Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice! 
PHP.4.5	Let your gentle 
PHP.4.6	Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. 
PHP.4.7	And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
PHP.4.8	Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things. 
PHP.4.9	The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.
PHP.4.10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned 
PHP.4.11	Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am. 
PHP.4.12	I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need. 
PHP.4.13	I can do all things through Him who strengthens me. 
PHP.4.14	Nevertheless, you have done well to share 
PHP.4.15	You yourselves also know, Philippians, that at the first preaching of the gospel, after I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you alone; 
PHP.4.16	for even in Thessalonica you sent 
PHP.4.17	Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases to your account. 
PHP.4.18	But I have received everything in full and have an abundance; I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God. 
PHP.4.19	And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 
PHP.4.20	Now to our God and Father 
PHP.4.21	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you. 
PHP.4.22	All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar’s household.
PHP.4.23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
COL.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
COL.1.2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ 
COL.1.3	We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, 
COL.1.4	since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints; 
COL.1.5	because of the hope laid up for you in heaven, of which you previously heard in the word of truth, the gospel 
COL.1.6	which has come to you, just as in all the world also it is constantly bearing fruit and increasing, even as 
COL.1.7	just as you learned 
COL.1.8	and he also informed us of your love in the Spirit.
COL.1.9	For this reason also, since the day we heard 
COL.1.10	so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please 
COL.1.11	strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience; joyously 
COL.1.12	giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in Light.
COL.1.13	For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, 
COL.1.14	in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
COL.1.15	He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. 
COL.1.16	For by Him all things were created, 
COL.1.17	He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together. 
COL.1.18	He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything. 
COL.1.19	For it was the 
COL.1.20	and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, 
COL.1.21	And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, 
COL.1.22	yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach— 
COL.1.23	if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made a minister.
COL.1.24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions. 
COL.1.25	Of 
COL.1.26	 the mystery which has been hidden from the 
COL.1.27	to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. 
COL.1.28	We proclaim Him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ. 
COL.1.29	For this purpose also I labor, striving according to His power, which mightily works within me.
COL.2.1	For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf and for those who are at Laodicea, and for all those who have not personally seen my face, 
COL.2.2	that their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and 
COL.2.3	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 
COL.2.4	I say this so that no one will delude you with persuasive argument. 
COL.2.5	For even though I am absent in body, nevertheless I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good discipline and the stability of your faith in Christ.
COL.2.6	Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, 
COL.2.7	having been firmly rooted 
COL.2.8	See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ. 
COL.2.9	For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form, 
COL.2.10	and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over all rule and authority; 
COL.2.11	and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ; 
COL.2.12	having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead. 
COL.2.13	When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions, 
COL.2.14	having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. 
COL.2.15	When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him.
COL.2.16	Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day— 
COL.2.17	things which are a 
COL.2.18	Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on 
COL.2.19	and not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God.
COL.2.20	If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as, 
COL.2.21	“Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!” 
COL.2.22	(which all 
COL.2.23	These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, 
COL.3.1	Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 
COL.3.2	Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth. 
COL.3.3	For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 
COL.3.4	When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.
COL.3.5	Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to idolatry. 
COL.3.6	For it is because of these things that the wrath of God will come 
COL.3.7	and in them you also once walked, when you were living in them. 
COL.3.8	But now you also, put them all aside: anger, wrath, malice, slander, 
COL.3.9	Do not lie to one another, since you laid aside the old self with its 
COL.3.10	and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him— 
COL.3.11	 in which there is no 
COL.3.12	So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience; 
COL.3.13	bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you. 
COL.3.14	Beyond all these things 
COL.3.15	Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body; and be thankful. 
COL.3.16	Let the word of 
COL.3.17	Whatever you do in word or deed, 
COL.3.18	Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 
COL.3.19	Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them. 
COL.3.20	Children, be obedient to your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord. 
COL.3.21	Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they will not lose heart.
COL.3.22	Slaves, in all things obey those who are your masters on earth, not with external service, as those who 
COL.3.23	Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men, 
COL.3.24	knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve. 
COL.3.25	For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done, and that without partiality.
COL.4.1	Masters, grant to your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you too have a Master in heaven.
COL.4.2	Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with 
COL.4.3	praying at the same time for us as well, that God will open up to us a door for the word, so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned; 
COL.4.4	that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak.
COL.4.5	Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity. 
COL.4.6	Let your speech always be with grace, 
COL.4.7	As to all my affairs, Tychicus, 
COL.4.8	 I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts; 
COL.4.9	and with him Onesimus, 
COL.4.10	Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and 
COL.4.11	and 
COL.4.12	Epaphras, who is one of your number, a bondslave of Jesus Christ, sends you his greetings, always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God. 
COL.4.13	For I testify for him that he has a deep concern for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis. 
COL.4.14	Luke, the beloved physician, sends you his greetings, and 
COL.4.15	Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea and also 
COL.4.16	When this letter is read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and you, for your part read my letter 
COL.4.17	Say to Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.”
COL.4.18	I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my imprisonment. Grace be with you.
1TH.1.1	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy,
1TH.1.2	We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention 
1TH.1.3	constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father, 
1TH.1.4	knowing, brethren beloved by God, 
1TH.1.5	for our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction; just as you know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake. 
1TH.1.6	You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit, 
1TH.1.7	so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. 
1TH.1.8	For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth, so that we have no need to say anything. 
1TH.1.9	For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God, 
1TH.1.10	and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, 
1TH.2.1	For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was not in vain, 
1TH.2.2	but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, as you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition. 
1TH.2.3	For our exhortation does not 
1TH.2.4	but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts. 
1TH.2.5	For we never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed—God is witness— 
1TH.2.6	nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, even though as apostles of Christ we might have asserted our authority. 
1TH.2.7	But we proved to be 
1TH.2.8	Having so fond an affection for you, we were well-pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us.
1TH.2.9	For you recall, brethren, our labor and hardship, 
1TH.2.10	You are witnesses, and 
1TH.2.11	just as you know how we 
1TH.2.12	so that you would walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.
1TH.2.13	For this reason we also constantly thank God that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted 
1TH.2.14	For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen, even as they 
1TH.2.15	who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out. They are not pleasing to God, but hostile to all men, 
1TH.2.16	hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved; with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them 
1TH.2.17	But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short while—in person, not in spirit—were all the more eager with great desire to see your face. 
1TH.2.18	For we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, more than once—and 
1TH.2.19	For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation? Is it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming? 
1TH.2.20	For you are our glory and joy.
1TH.3.1	Therefore when we could endure 
1TH.3.2	and we sent Timothy, our brother and God’s fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith, 
1TH.3.3	so that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we have been destined for this. 
1TH.3.4	For indeed when we were with you, we 
1TH.3.5	For this reason, when I could endure 
1TH.3.6	But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always think kindly of us, longing to see us just as we also long to see you, 
1TH.3.7	for this reason, brethren, in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith; 
1TH.3.8	for now we 
1TH.3.9	For what thanks can we render to God for you in return for all the joy with which we rejoice before our God on your account, 
1TH.3.10	as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may see your face, and may complete what is lacking in your faith?
1TH.3.11	Now may our God and Father Himself and Jesus our Lord direct our way to you; 
1TH.3.12	and may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love for one another, and for all people, just as we also 
1TH.3.13	so that He may establish your hearts without blame in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.
1TH.4.1	Finally then, brethren, we request and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us 
1TH.4.2	For you know what commandments we gave you 
1TH.4.3	For this is the will of God, your sanctification; 
1TH.4.4	that each of you know how to possess his own 
1TH.4.5	not in lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God; 
1TH.4.6	 that no man transgress and defraud his brother in the matter because the Lord is 
1TH.4.7	For God has not called us for the purpose of impurity, but in sanctification. 
1TH.4.8	So, he who rejects 
1TH.4.9	Now as to the love of the brethren, you have no need for 
1TH.4.10	for indeed you do practice it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, to excel still more, 
1TH.4.11	and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own business and work with your hands, just as we commanded you, 
1TH.4.12	so that you will behave properly toward outsiders and not be in any need.
1TH.4.13	But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope. 
1TH.4.14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus. 
1TH.4.15	For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. 
1TH.4.16	For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of 
1TH.4.17	Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord. 
1TH.4.18	Therefore comfort one another with these words.
1TH.5.1	Now as to the times and the epochs, brethren, you have no need of anything to be written to you. 
1TH.5.2	For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night. 
1TH.5.3	While they are saying, “Peace and safety!” then destruction will come upon them suddenly like labor pains upon a woman with child, and they will not escape. 
1TH.5.4	But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day would overtake you like a thief; 
1TH.5.5	for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness; 
1TH.5.6	so then let us not sleep as others do, but let us be alert and 
1TH.5.7	For those who sleep do their sleeping at night, and those who get drunk get drunk at night. 
1TH.5.8	But since we are of 
1TH.5.9	For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1TH.5.10	who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him. 
1TH.5.11	Therefore encourage one another and build up one another, just as you also are doing.
1TH.5.12	But we request of you, brethren, that you appreciate those who diligently labor among you, and have charge over you in the Lord and give you instruction, 
1TH.5.13	and that you esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Live in peace with one another. 
1TH.5.14	We urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone. 
1TH.5.15	See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek after that which is good for one another and for all people. 
1TH.5.16	Rejoice always; 
1TH.5.17	pray without ceasing; 
1TH.5.18	in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. 
1TH.5.19	Do not quench the Spirit; 
1TH.5.20	do not despise prophetic 
1TH.5.21	But examine everything 
1TH.5.22	abstain from every 
1TH.5.23	Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1TH.5.24	Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass.
1TH.5.25	Brethren, pray for us
1TH.5.26	Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss. 
1TH.5.27	I adjure you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brethren.
1TH.5.28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
2TH.1.1	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy,
2TH.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.1.3	We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren, as is 
2TH.1.4	therefore, we ourselves speak proudly of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure. 
2TH.1.5	 a plain indication of God’s righteous judgment so that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering. 
2TH.1.6	For after all it is 
2TH.1.7	and 
2TH.1.8	dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 
2TH.1.9	These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, 
2TH.1.10	when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who have believed—for our testimony to you was believed. 
2TH.1.11	To this end also we pray for you always, that our God will count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire for goodness and the work of faith with power, 
2TH.1.12	so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and 
2TH.2.1	Now we request you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, 
2TH.2.2	that you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. 
2TH.2.3	Let no one in any way deceive you, for 
2TH.2.4	who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God. 
2TH.2.5	Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I was telling you these things? 
2TH.2.6	And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he will be revealed. 
2TH.2.7	For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains 
2TH.2.8	Then that lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming; 
2TH.2.9	 the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders, 
2TH.2.10	and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved. 
2TH.2.11	For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false, 
2TH.2.12	in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness.
2TH.2.13	But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you 
2TH.2.14	It was for this He called you through our gospel, that you may gain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2TH.2.15	So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word 
2TH.2.16	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace, 
2TH.2.17	comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word.
2TH.3.1	Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord will spread rapidly and be glorified, just as 
2TH.3.2	and that we will be rescued from perverse and evil men; for not all have faith. 
2TH.3.3	But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil 
2TH.3.4	We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will 
2TH.3.5	May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of Christ.
2TH.3.6	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life and not according to the tradition which you received from us. 
2TH.3.7	For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example, because we did not act in an undisciplined manner among you, 
2TH.3.8	nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we 
2TH.3.9	not because we do not have the right 
2TH.3.10	For even when we were with you, we used to give you this order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either. 
2TH.3.11	For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies. 
2TH.3.12	Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and eat their own bread. 
2TH.3.13	But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary of doing good.
2TH.3.14	If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he will be put to shame. 
2TH.3.15	 do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
2TH.3.16	Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all!
2TH.3.17	I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write. 
2TH.3.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
1TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, 
1TI.1.2	To Timothy, 
1TI.1.3	As I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines, 
1TI.1.4	nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to mere speculation rather than 
1TI.1.5	But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. 
1TI.1.6	For some men, straying from these things, have turned aside to fruitless discussion, 
1TI.1.7	wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.
1TI.1.8	But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully, 
1TI.1.9	realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers 
1TI.1.10	and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching, 
1TI.1.11	according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.
1TI.1.12	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, putting me into service, 
1TI.1.13	even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief; 
1TI.1.14	and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant, with the faith and love which are 
1TI.1.15	It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost 
1TI.1.16	Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life. 
1TI.1.17	Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, 
1TI.1.18	This command I entrust to you, Timothy, 
1TI.1.19	keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith. 
1TI.1.20	Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to blaspheme.
1TI.2.1	First of all, then, I urge that entreaties 
1TI.2.2	for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. 
1TI.2.3	This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 
1TI.2.4	who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
1TI.2.5	For there is one God, 
1TI.2.6	who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony 
1TI.2.7	For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying) as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
1TI.2.8	Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and dissension.
1TI.2.9	Likewise, 
1TI.2.10	but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness. 
1TI.2.11	A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness. 
1TI.2.12	But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet. 
1TI.2.13	For it was Adam who was first created, 
1TI.2.14	And 
1TI.2.15	But 
1TI.3.1	It is a trustworthy statement: if any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires 
1TI.3.2	An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 
1TI.3.3	not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but gentle, peaceable, free from the love of money. 
1TI.3.4	 one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity 
1TI.3.5	(but if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?), 
1TI.3.6	 not a new convert, so that he will not become conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil. 
1TI.3.7	And he must have a good reputation with those outside 
1TI.3.8	Deacons likewise 
1TI.3.9	 holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. 
1TI.3.10	These men must also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach. 
1TI.3.11	Women 
1TI.3.12	Deacons must be husbands of 
1TI.3.13	For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
1TI.3.14	I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you before long; 
1TI.3.15	but in case I am delayed, 
1TI.3.16	By common confession, great is the mystery of godliness:
1TI.3.16	He who was revealed in the flesh,
1TI.3.16	Was vindicated in the Spirit,
1TI.3.16	Seen by angels,
1TI.3.16	Proclaimed among the nations,
1TI.3.16	Believed on in the world,
1TI.3.16	Taken up in glory.
1TI.4.1	But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons, 
1TI.4.2	by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron, 
1TI.4.3	 who forbid marriage 
1TI.4.4	For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude; 
1TI.4.5	for it is sanctified by means of the word of God and prayer.
1TI.4.6	In pointing out these things to the brethren, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, 
1TI.4.7	But have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women. On the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness; 
1TI.4.8	for bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and 
1TI.4.9	It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance. 
1TI.4.10	For it is for this we labor and strive, because we have fixed our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers.
1TI.4.11	Prescribe and teach these things. 
1TI.4.12	Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but 
1TI.4.13	Until I come, give attention to the 
1TI.4.14	Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was bestowed on you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the presbytery. 
1TI.4.15	Take pains with these things; be 
1TI.4.16	Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching; persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you.
1TI.5.1	Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but 
1TI.5.2	the older women as mothers, 
1TI.5.3	Honor widows who are widows indeed; 
1TI.5.4	but if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to practice piety in regard to their own family and to make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God. 
1TI.5.5	Now she who is a widow indeed and who has been left alone, has fixed her hope on God and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day. 
1TI.5.6	But she who gives herself to wanton pleasure is dead even while she lives. 
1TI.5.7	Prescribe these things as well, so that they may be above reproach. 
1TI.5.8	But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
1TI.5.9	A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old, 
1TI.5.10	having a reputation for good works; 
1TI.5.11	But refuse 
1TI.5.12	 incurring condemnation, because they have set aside their previous pledge. 
1TI.5.13	At the same time they also learn 
1TI.5.14	Therefore, I want younger 
1TI.5.15	for some have already turned aside to follow Satan. 
1TI.5.16	If any woman who is a believer has 
1TI.5.17	The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching. 
1TI.5.18	For the Scripture says, “Y
1TI.5.19	Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses. 
1TI.5.20	Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also will be fearful 
1TI.5.21	I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of 
1TI.5.22	Do not lay hands upon anyone 
1TI.5.23	No longer drink water 
1TI.5.24	The sins of some men are quite evident, going before them to judgment; for others, their 
1TI.5.25	Likewise also, deeds that are good are quite evident, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed.
1TI.6.1	All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and 
1TI.6.2	Those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but must serve them all the more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach and preach these 
1TI.6.3	If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine conforming to godliness, 
1TI.6.4	he is conceited 
1TI.6.5	and constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. 
1TI.6.6	But godliness 
1TI.6.7	For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out of it either. 
1TI.6.8	If we have food and covering, with these we shall be content. 
1TI.6.9	But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and destruction. 
1TI.6.10	For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.
1TI.6.11	But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance 
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 
1TI.6.13	I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, 
1TI.6.14	that you keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1TI.6.15	which He will bring about at the proper time—He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 
1TI.6.16	who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him 
1TI.6.17	Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy. 
1TI.6.18	 to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, 
1TI.6.19	storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed.
1TI.6.20	O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding worldly 
1TI.6.21	which some have professed and thus gone astray from the faith.
2TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,
2TI.1.2	To Timothy, my beloved son: Grace, mercy 
2TI.1.3	I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day, 
2TI.1.4	longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled with joy. 
2TI.1.5	For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that 
2TI.1.6	For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 
2TI.1.7	For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.
2TI.1.8	Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with 
2TI.1.9	who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity, 
2TI.1.10	but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, 
2TI.1.11	for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher. 
2TI.1.12	For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day. 
2TI.1.13	Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.1.14	Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to 
2TI.1.15	You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. 
2TI.1.16	The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains; 
2TI.1.17	but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me— 
2TI.1.18	the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day—and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus.
2TI.2.1	You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.2	The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. 
2TI.2.3	Suffer hardship with 
2TI.2.4	No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier. 
2TI.2.5	Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules. 
2TI.2.6	The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops. 
2TI.2.7	Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.
2TI.2.8	Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David, according to my gospel, 
2TI.2.9	for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal; but the word of God is not imprisoned. 
2TI.2.10	For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus 
2TI.2.11	It is a trustworthy statement:
2TI.2.11	For if we died with Him, we will also live with Him;
2TI.2.12	If we endure, we will also reign with Him;
2TI.2.12	If we deny Him, He also will deny us;
2TI.2.13	If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.
2TI.2.14	Remind 
2TI.2.15	Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth. 
2TI.2.16	But avoid worldly 
2TI.2.17	and their talk will spread like 
2TI.2.18	 who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some. 
2TI.2.19	Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.”
2TI.2.20	Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor. 
2TI.2.21	Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these 
2TI.2.22	Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love 
2TI.2.23	But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels. 
2TI.2.24	The Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, 
2TI.2.25	with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth, 
2TI.2.26	and they may come to their senses 
2TI.3.1	But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come. 
2TI.3.2	For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, 
2TI.3.3	unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good, 
2TI.3.4	treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 
2TI.3.5	holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power; Avoid such men as these. 
2TI.3.6	For among them are those who enter into households and captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses, 
2TI.3.7	always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
2TI.3.8	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these 
2TI.3.9	But they will not make further progress; for their folly will be obvious to all, just as Jannes’s and Jambres’s folly was also.
2TI.3.10	Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance, 
2TI.3.11	persecutions, 
2TI.3.12	Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 
2TI.3.13	But evil men and impostors will proceed 
2TI.3.14	You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned 
2TI.3.15	and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.3.16	All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; 
2TI.3.17	so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.
2TI.4.1	I solemnly charge 
2TI.4.2	preach the word; be ready in season 
2TI.4.3	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but 
2TI.4.4	and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths. 
2TI.4.5	But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.
2TI.4.6	For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. 
2TI.4.7	I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; 
2TI.4.8	in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.
2TI.4.9	Make every effort to come to me soon; 
2TI.4.10	for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens 
2TI.4.11	Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. 
2TI.4.12	But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. 
2TI.4.13	When you come bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments. 
2TI.4.14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds. 
2TI.4.15	Be on guard against him yourself, for he vigorously opposed our teaching.
2TI.4.16	At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me; may it not be counted against them. 
2TI.4.17	But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth. 
2TI.4.18	The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him 
2TI.4.19	Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. 
2TI.4.20	Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus. 
2TI.4.21	Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.
2TI.4.22	The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
TIT.1.1	Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, 
TIT.1.2	in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago, 
TIT.1.3	but at the proper time manifested, 
TIT.1.4	To Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
TIT.1.5	For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you, 
TIT.1.6	 if any man is above reproach, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of dissipation or rebellion. 
TIT.1.7	For the overseer must be above reproach as God’s steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not fond of sordid gain, 
TIT.1.8	but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, just, devout, self-controlled, 
TIT.1.9	holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict.
TIT.1.10	For there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, 
TIT.1.11	who must be silenced because they are upsetting whole families, teaching things they should not 
TIT.1.12	One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” 
TIT.1.13	This testimony is true. For this reason reprove them severely so that they may be sound in the faith, 
TIT.1.14	not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. 
TIT.1.15	To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. 
TIT.1.16	They profess to know God, but by 
TIT.2.1	But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine. 
TIT.2.2	Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, in perseverance.
TIT.2.3	Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good, 
TIT.2.4	so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 
TIT.2.5	 sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored.
TIT.2.6	Likewise urge the young men to be sensible; 
TIT.2.7	in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, 
TIT.2.8	sound 
TIT.2.10	not pilfering, but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every respect.
TIT.2.11	For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, 
TIT.2.12	instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age, 
TIT.2.13	looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus, 
TIT.2.14	who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.
TIT.2.15	These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
TIT.3.1	Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed, 
TIT.3.2	to malign no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing every consideration for all men. 
TIT.3.3	For we also once were foolish ourselves, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another. 
TIT.3.4	But when the kindness of God our Savior and 
TIT.3.5	He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, 
TIT.3.6	whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
TIT.3.7	so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to 
TIT.3.8	This is a trustworthy statement; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God will be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and profitable for men. 
TIT.3.9	But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and disputes about the Law, for they are unprofitable and worthless. 
TIT.3.10	Reject a factious man after a first and second warning, 
TIT.3.11	knowing that such a man is perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned.
TIT.3.12	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. 
TIT.3.13	Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that nothing is lacking for them. 
TIT.3.14	Our people must also learn to engage in good deeds to meet pressing needs, so that they will not be unfruitful.
TIT.3.15	All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in 
PHM.1.1	Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,
PHM.1.2	and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house: 
PHM.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHM.1.4	I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, 
PHM.1.5	because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints; 
PHM.1.6	 that the fellowship of your faith may become effective 
PHM.1.7	For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
PHM.1.8	Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you 
PHM.1.9	yet for love’s sake I rather appeal 
PHM.1.10	I appeal to you for my child 
PHM.1.11	who formerly was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me. 
PHM.1.12	I have sent him back to you in person, that is, 
PHM.1.13	whom I wished to keep with me, so that on your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the gospel; 
PHM.1.14	but without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will. 
PHM.1.15	For perhaps he was for this reason separated 
PHM.1.16	no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
PHM.1.17	If then you regard me a partner, accept him as 
PHM.1.18	But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account; 
PHM.1.19	I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well). 
PHM.1.20	Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
PHM.1.21	Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, since I know that you will do even more than what I say.
PHM.1.22	At the same time also prepare me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you.
PHM.1.23	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, 
PHM.1.24	 Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.
PHM.1.25	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
HEB.1.1	God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, 
HEB.1.2	in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world. 
HEB.1.3	And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, 
HEB.1.4	having become as much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.
HEB.1.5	For to which of the angels did He ever say,
HEB.1.5	“Y
HEB.1.5	T
HEB.1.5	And again,
HEB.1.5	“I 
HEB.1.5	A
HEB.1.6	And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says,
HEB.1.6	“A
HEB.1.7	And of the angels He says,
HEB.1.7	“W
HEB.1.7	A
HEB.1.8	But of the Son 
HEB.1.8	“Y
HEB.1.8	A
HEB.1.9	Y
HEB.1.9	T
HEB.1.9	W
HEB.1.10	And,
HEB.1.10	“Y
HEB.1.10	A
HEB.1.11	T
HEB.1.11	A
HEB.1.12	A
HEB.1.12	L
HEB.1.12	B
HEB.1.12	A
HEB.1.13	But to which of the angels has He ever said,
HEB.1.13	“S
HEB.1.13	U
HEB.1.13	A 
HEB.1.14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?
HEB.2.1	For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away 
HEB.2.2	For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable, and every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty, 
HEB.2.3	how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? After it was at the first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard, 
HEB.2.4	God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will.
HEB.2.5	For He did not subject to angels the world to come, concerning which we are speaking. 
HEB.2.6	But one has testified somewhere, saying,
HEB.2.6	“W
HEB.2.6	O
HEB.2.7	Y
HEB.2.7	Y
HEB.2.8	Y
HEB.2.8	For in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him.
HEB.2.9	But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the angels, 
HEB.2.10	For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings. 
HEB.2.11	For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one 
HEB.2.12	saying,
HEB.2.12	“I 
HEB.2.12	I
HEB.2.13	And again,
HEB.2.13	“I 
HEB.2.13	And again,
HEB.2.13	“B
HEB.2.14	Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, 
HEB.2.15	and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives. 
HEB.2.16	For assuredly He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the descendant of Abraham. 
HEB.2.17	Therefore, He had to be made like His brethren in all things, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. 
HEB.2.18	For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted.
HEB.3.1	Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession; 
HEB.3.2	He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house. 
HEB.3.3	For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house. 
HEB.3.4	For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. 
HEB.3.5	Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later; 
HEB.3.6	but Christ 
HEB.3.7	Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says,
HEB.3.7	“T
HEB.3.8	D
HEB.3.8	A
HEB.3.9	W
HEB.3.9	A
HEB.3.10	T
HEB.3.10	A
HEB.3.10	A
HEB.3.11	A
HEB.3.11	‘T
HEB.3.12	Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God. 
HEB.3.13	But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is 
HEB.3.14	For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end, 
HEB.3.15	while it is said,
HEB.3.15	“T
HEB.3.15	D
HEB.3.16	For who provoked 
HEB.3.17	And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 
HEB.3.18	And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were disobedient? 
HEB.3.19	 we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
HEB.4.1	Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it. 
HEB.4.2	For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard. 
HEB.4.3	For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said,
HEB.4.3	“A
HEB.4.3	T
HEB.4.3	although His works were finished from the foundation of the world. 
HEB.4.4	For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh 
HEB.4.5	and again in this 
HEB.4.6	Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience, 
HEB.4.7	He again fixes a certain day, “Today,” saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before,
HEB.4.7	“T
HEB.4.7	D
HEB.4.8	For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that. 
HEB.4.9	So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God. 
HEB.4.10	For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His. 
HEB.4.11	Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall, through 
HEB.4.12	For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 
HEB.4.13	And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.
HEB.4.14	Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. 
HEB.4.15	For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as 
HEB.4.16	Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
HEB.5.1	For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; 
HEB.5.2	he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself also is beset with weakness; 
HEB.5.3	and because of it he is obligated to offer 
HEB.5.4	And no one takes the honor to himself, but 
HEB.5.5	So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high priest, but He who said to Him,
HEB.5.5	“Y
HEB.5.5	T
HEB.5.6	just as He says also in another 
HEB.5.6	“Y
HEB.5.6	A
HEB.5.7	In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety. 
HEB.5.8	Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered. 
HEB.5.9	And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation, 
HEB.5.10	being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
HEB.5.11	Concerning 
HEB.5.12	For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food. 
HEB.5.13	For everyone who partakes 
HEB.5.14	But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil.
HEB.6.1	Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, 
HEB.6.2	of instruction about washings and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment. 
HEB.6.3	And this we will do, if God permits. 
HEB.6.4	For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, 
HEB.6.5	and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, 
HEB.6.6	and 
HEB.6.7	For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God; 
HEB.6.8	but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned.
HEB.6.9	But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way. 
HEB.6.10	For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints. 
HEB.6.11	And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end, 
HEB.6.12	so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
HEB.6.13	For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself, 
HEB.6.14	saying, “I 
HEB.6.15	And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise. 
HEB.6.16	For men swear by one greater 
HEB.6.17	In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an oath, 
HEB.6.18	so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us. 
HEB.6.19	This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a 
HEB.6.20	where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
HEB.7.1	For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 
HEB.7.2	to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all 
HEB.7.3	Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.
HEB.7.4	Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. 
HEB.7.5	And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham. 
HEB.7.6	But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. 
HEB.7.7	But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. 
HEB.7.8	In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one 
HEB.7.9	And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes, 
HEB.7.10	for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
HEB.7.11	Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need 
HEB.7.12	For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also. 
HEB.7.13	For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. 
HEB.7.14	For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. 
HEB.7.15	And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, 
HEB.7.16	who has become 
HEB.7.17	For it is attested 
HEB.7.17	“Y
HEB.7.17	A
HEB.7.18	For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness 
HEB.7.19	(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. 
HEB.7.20	And inasmuch as 
HEB.7.21	(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him,
HEB.7.21	“T
HEB.7.21	A
HEB.7.21	‘Y
HEB.7.22	so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.
HEB.7.23	The 
HEB.7.24	but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently. 
HEB.7.25	Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.
HEB.7.26	For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens; 
HEB.7.27	who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the 
HEB.7.28	For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, 
HEB.8.1	Now the main point in what has been said 
HEB.8.2	a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man. 
HEB.8.3	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this 
HEB.8.4	Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law; 
HEB.8.5	who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned 
HEB.8.6	But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.
HEB.8.7	For if that first

HEB.8.13	When He said, “A new 
HEB.9.1	Now even the first 
HEB.9.2	For there was a tabernacle prepared, the outer one, in which 
HEB.9.3	Behind the second veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies, 
HEB.9.4	having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod which budded, and the tables of the covenant; 
HEB.9.5	and above it 
HEB.9.6	Now when these things have been so prepared, the priests are continually entering the outer tabernacle performing the divine worship, 
HEB.9.7	but into the second, only the high priest 
HEB.9.8	The Holy Spirit 
HEB.9.9	which 
HEB.9.10	since they 
HEB.9.11	But when Christ appeared 
HEB.9.12	and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption. 
HEB.9.13	For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh, 
HEB.9.14	how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
HEB.9.15	For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were 
HEB.9.16	For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it. 
HEB.9.17	For a covenant is valid 
HEB.9.18	Therefore even the first 
HEB.9.19	For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, 
HEB.9.20	saying, “T
HEB.9.21	And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood. 
HEB.9.22	And according to the Law, 
HEB.9.23	Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 
HEB.9.24	For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a 
HEB.9.25	nor was it that He would offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood that is not his own. 
HEB.9.26	Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. 
HEB.9.27	And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this 
HEB.9.28	so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without 
HEB.10.1	For the Law, since it has 
HEB.10.2	Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins? 
HEB.10.3	But in those 
HEB.10.4	For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 
HEB.10.5	Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says,

HEB.10.11	Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins; 
HEB.10.12	but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, 
HEB.10.13	waiting from that time onward 
HEB.10.14	For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.

HEB.10.21	and since 
HEB.10.22	let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled 
HEB.10.23	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful;

HEB.10.25	not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging 
HEB.10.26	For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 
HEB.10.27	but a terrifying expectation of judgment and 
HEB.10.28	Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on 
HEB.10.29	How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?

HEB.10.31	It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
HEB.10.32	But remember the former days, when, after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings, 
HEB.10.33	partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated. 
HEB.10.34	For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one. 
HEB.10.35	Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.

HEB.11.1	Now faith is the assurance of 
HEB.11.2	For by it the men of old gained approval.
HEB.11.3	By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. 
HEB.11.4	By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks. 
HEB.11.5	By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; 
HEB.11.6	And without faith it is impossible to please 
HEB.11.7	By faith Noah, being warned 
HEB.11.8	By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going. 
HEB.11.9	By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign 
HEB.11.10	for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 
HEB.11.11	By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised. 
HEB.11.12	Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, 
HEB.11.13	All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 
HEB.11.14	For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. 
HEB.11.15	And indeed if they had been thinking of that 
HEB.11.16	But as it is, they desire a better 
HEB.11.17	By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten 
HEB.11.18	 to whom it was said, “I

HEB.11.20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come. 
HEB.11.21	By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, 
HEB.11.22	By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.
HEB.11.23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. 
HEB.11.24	By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 
HEB.11.25	choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, 
HEB.11.26	considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward. 
HEB.11.27	By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen. 
HEB.11.28	By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. 
HEB.11.29	By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though 
HEB.11.30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. 
HEB.11.31	By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace.
HEB.11.32	And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, 
HEB.11.33	who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed 
HEB.11.34	quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. 
HEB.11.35	Women received 
HEB.11.36	and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment. 
HEB.11.37	They were stoned, they were sawn in two, 
HEB.11.38	(
HEB.11.39	And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised, 
HEB.11.40	because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.
HEB.12.1	Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 
HEB.12.2	fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
HEB.12.3	For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
HEB.12.4	You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin; 
HEB.12.5	and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons,

HEB.12.6	A
HEB.12.7	It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom 
HEB.12.8	But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. 
HEB.12.9	Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live? 
HEB.12.10	For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He 
HEB.12.11	All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.
HEB.12.12	Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble, 
HEB.12.13	and make straight paths for your feet, so that 
HEB.12.14	Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord.

JAS.1.1	James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
JAS.1.2	Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, 
JAS.1.3	knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 
JAS.1.4	And let endurance have 
JAS.1.5	But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him. 
JAS.1.6	But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind. 
JAS.1.7	For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord, 
JAS.1.8	 a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
JAS.1.9	But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position; 
JAS.1.10	and the rich man 
JAS.1.11	For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away.
JAS.1.12	Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which 
JAS.1.13	Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone. 
JAS.1.14	But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. 
JAS.1.15	Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death. 
JAS.1.16	Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren. 
JAS.1.17	Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow. 
JAS.1.18	In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures.
JAS.1.20	for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God. 
JAS.1.21	Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and 
JAS.1.22	But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves. 
JAS.1.23	For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror; 
JAS.1.24	for 
JAS.1.25	But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the 
JAS.1.26	If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his 
JAS.1.27	Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of 
JAS.2.1	My brethren, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with 
JAS.2.2	For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes, 
JAS.2.3	and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes, and say, “You sit here in a good place,” and you say to the poor man, “You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool,” 
JAS.2.4	have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives? 
JAS.2.5	Listen, my beloved brethren: did not God choose the poor of this world 
JAS.2.6	But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court? 
JAS.2.7	Do they not blaspheme the fair name by which you have been called?
JAS.2.8	If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, “Y
JAS.2.9	But if you show partiality, you are committing sin 
JAS.2.10	For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one 
JAS.2.11	For He who said, “D
JAS.2.12	So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by 
JAS.2.13	For judgment 
JAS.2.14	What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him? 
JAS.2.15	If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, 
JAS.2.16	and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,” and yet you do not give them what is necessary for 
JAS.2.17	Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, 
JAS.2.18	But someone may 
JAS.2.19	You believe that 
JAS.2.20	But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless? 
JAS.2.21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? 
JAS.2.22	You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; 
JAS.2.23	and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “A
JAS.2.24	You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone. 
JAS.2.25	In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? 
JAS.2.26	For just as the body without 
JAS.3.1	Let not many 
JAS.3.2	For we all stumble in many 
JAS.3.3	Now if we put the bits into the horses’ mouths so that they will obey us, we direct their entire body as well. 
JAS.3.4	Look at the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot desires. 
JAS.3.5	So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and 
JAS.3.6	And the tongue is a fire, the 
JAS.3.7	For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race. 
JAS.3.8	But no one can tame the tongue; 
JAS.3.9	With it we bless 
JAS.3.10	from the same mouth come 
JAS.3.11	Does a fountain send out from the same opening 
JAS.3.12	Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Nor 
JAS.3.13	Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. 
JAS.3.14	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and 
JAS.3.15	This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic. 
JAS.3.16	For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing. 
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy. 
JAS.3.18	And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
JAS.4.1	What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members? 
JAS.4.2	You lust and do not have; 
JAS.4.3	You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend 
JAS.4.4	You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 
JAS.4.5	Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose: “
JAS.4.6	But He gives a greater grace. Therefore 
JAS.4.7	Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. 
JAS.4.8	Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded. 
JAS.4.9	Be miserable and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to gloom. 
JAS.4.10	Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.
JAS.4.11	Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge 
JAS.4.12	There is 
JAS.4.13	Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.” 
JAS.4.14	Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are 
JAS.4.15	Instead, 
JAS.4.16	But as it is, you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil. 
JAS.4.17	Therefore, to one who knows 
JAS.5.1	Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you. 
JAS.5.2	Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten. 
JAS.5.3	Your gold and your silver have rusted; and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last days that you have stored up your treasure! 
JAS.5.4	Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields, 
JAS.5.5	You have lived luxuriously on the earth and led a life of wanton pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. 
JAS.5.6	You have condemned and put to death the righteous 
JAS.5.7	Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it, until it gets the early and late rains. 
JAS.5.8	You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near. 
JAS.5.9	Do not complain, brethren, against one another, so that you yourselves may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing right at the door. 
JAS.5.10	As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. 
JAS.5.11	We count those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord’s dealings, that the Lord is full of compassion and 
JAS.5.12	But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath; but your yes is to be yes, and your no, no, so that you may not fall under judgment.
JAS.5.13	Is anyone among you suffering? 
JAS.5.14	Is anyone among you sick? 
JAS.5.15	and the prayer offered in faith will 
JAS.5.16	Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much. 
JAS.5.17	Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months. 
JAS.5.18	Then he prayed again, and the sky poured rain and the earth produced its fruit.
JAS.5.19	My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back, 
JAS.5.20	let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.
1PE.1.1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,
1PE.1.2	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.
1PE.1.3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
1PE.1.4	to 
1PE.1.5	who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 
1PE.1.6	In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, 
1PE.1.7	so that the proof of your faith, 
1PE.1.8	and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, 
1PE.1.9	obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of 
1PE.1.10	As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that 
1PE.1.11	seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. 
1PE.1.12	It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look.
1PE.1.13	Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober 
1PE.1.14	As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts 
1PE.1.15	but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all 
1PE.1.16	because it is written, “Y
1PE.1.17	If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay 
1PE.1.18	knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, 
1PE.1.19	but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, 
1PE.1.20	For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you 
1PE.1.21	who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
1PE.1.22	Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from

1PE.2.1	Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, 
1PE.2.2	like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, 
1PE.2.3	if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.
1PE.2.4	And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God, 
1PE.2.5	you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

1PE.2.10	for you once were 
1PE.2.11	Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul. 
1PE.2.12	Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe 
1PE.2.13	Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, 
1PE.2.14	or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right. 
1PE.2.15	For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men. 
1PE.2.16	 as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but 
1PE.2.17	Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king.
1PE.2.18	Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable. 
1PE.2.19	For this 
1PE.2.20	For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer 
1PE.2.21	For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps, 
1PE.2.22	, 
1PE.2.23	and while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting 
1PE.2.24	and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed. 
1PE.2.25	For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.
1PE.3.1	In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any

1PE.3.3	Your adornment must not be

1PE.3.5	For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands; 
1PE.3.6	just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear.
1PE.3.7	You husbands in the same way, live with 
1PE.3.8	To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit; 
1PE.3.9	not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing.

1PE.3.16	and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame. 
1PE.3.17	For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong. 
1PE.3.18	For Christ also died for sins once for all, 
1PE.3.19	in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits 
1PE.3.20	who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through 
1PE.3.21	Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 
1PE.3.22	who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him.
1PE.4.1	Therefore, since Christ has

1PE.4.4	In 
1PE.4.5	but they will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 
1PE.4.6	For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the spirit according to 
1PE.4.7	The end of all things is near; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober 
1PE.4.8	Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins. 
1PE.4.9	Be hospitable to one another without complaint. 
1PE.4.10	As each one has received a

1PE.4.12	Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you; 
1PE.4.13	but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exultation. 
1PE.4.14	If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. 
1PE.4.15	Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler;

1PE.5.2	shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to 
1PE.5.3	nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock.

1PE.5.13	She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and 
1PE.5.14	Greet one another with a kiss of love.
2PE.1.1	Simon Peter, a bond-servant and apostle of Jesus Christ,
2PE.1.2	Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord; 
2PE.1.3	seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence. 
2PE.1.4	For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of 
2PE.1.5	Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence, and in 
2PE.1.6	and in 
2PE.1.7	and in 
2PE.1.8	For if these 
2PE.1.9	For he who lacks these 
2PE.1.10	Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent to make certain about His calling and choosing you; for as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble; 
2PE.1.11	for in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you.
2PE.1.12	Therefore, I will always be ready to remind you of these things, even though you 
2PE.1.13	I consider it right, as long as I am in this 
2PE.1.14	knowing that the laying aside of my 
2PE.1.15	And I will also be diligent that at any time after my departure you will be able to call these things to mind.
2PE.1.16	For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty. 
2PE.1.17	For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, such an utterance as this was made to Him by the Majestic Glory, “This is My beloved Son with whom I am well-pleased”— 
2PE.1.18	and we ourselves heard this utterance made from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.
2PE.1.20	But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is 
2PE.1.21	for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.
2PE.2.1	But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves. 
2PE.2.2	Many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of the truth will be maligned; 
2PE.2.3	and in 
2PE.2.4	For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment; 
2PE.2.5	and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; 
2PE.2.6	and 
2PE.2.7	and 
2PE.2.8	(for by what he saw and heard 
2PE.2.9	 the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment, 
2PE.2.10	and especially those who indulge the flesh in 
2PE.2.11	whereas angels who are greater in might and power do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord. 
2PE.2.12	But these, like unreasoning animals, born as creatures of instinct to be captured and killed, reviling where they have no knowledge, will in the destruction of those creatures also be destroyed, 
2PE.2.13	suffering wrong as the wages of doing wrong. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are stains and blemishes, reveling in their 
2PE.2.14	having eyes full of adultery that never cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart trained in greed, accursed children; 
2PE.2.15	forsaking the right way, they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, the 
2PE.2.16	but he received a rebuke for his own transgression, 
2PE.2.17	These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm, for whom the black darkness has been reserved. 
2PE.2.18	For speaking out arrogant 
2PE.2.19	promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by what a man is overcome, by this he is enslaved. 
2PE.2.20	For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first. 
2PE.2.21	For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them. 
2PE.2.22	It has happened to them according to the true proverb, “A 
2PE.3.1	This is now, beloved, the second letter I am writing to you in which I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder, 
2PE.3.2	that you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior 
2PE.3.3	Know this first of all, that in the last days mockers will come with 
2PE.3.4	and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For 
2PE.3.5	For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the word of God 
2PE.3.6	through which the world at that time was destroyed, being flooded with water. 
2PE.3.7	But by His word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
2PE.3.8	But do not let this one 
2PE.3.9	The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.
2PE.3.10	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be 
2PE.3.11	Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, 
2PE.3.12	looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the elements will melt with intense heat! 
2PE.3.13	But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.
2PE.3.14	Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless, 
2PE.3.15	and regard the patience of our Lord 
2PE.3.16	as also in all 
2PE.3.17	You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of unprincipled men and fall from your own steadfastness, 
2PE.3.18	but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him 
1JN.1.1	What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the Word of Life— 
1JN.1.2	and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us— 
1JN.1.3	what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ. 
1JN.1.4	These things we write, so that our joy may be made complete.
1JN.1.5	This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. 
1JN.1.6	If we say that we have fellowship with Him and 
1JN.1.7	but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. 
1JN.1.8	If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. 
1JN.1.9	If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 
1JN.1.10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us.
1JN.2.1	My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an 
1JN.2.2	and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for 
1JN.2.3	By this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments. 
1JN.2.4	The one who says, “I have come to know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him; 
1JN.2.5	but whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has truly been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him: 
1JN.2.6	the one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked.
1JN.2.7	Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you have heard. 
1JN.2.8	On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true Light is already shining. 
1JN.2.9	The one who says he is in the Light and 
1JN.2.10	The one who loves his brother abides in the Light and there is no cause for stumbling in him. 
1JN.2.11	But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
1JN.2.12	I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you for His name’s sake. 
1JN.2.13	I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the Father. 
1JN.2.14	I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
1JN.2.15	Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
1JN.2.16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world. 
1JN.2.17	The world is passing away, and 
1JN.2.18	Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we know that it is the last hour. 
1JN.2.19	They went out from us, but they were not 
1JN.2.20	But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know. 
1JN.2.21	I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie is of the truth. 
1JN.2.22	Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. 
1JN.2.23	Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also. 
1JN.2.24	As for you, let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father.
1JN.2.25	This is the promise which He Himself made to us: eternal life.
1JN.2.26	These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you. 
1JN.2.27	As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you abide in Him.
1JN.2.28	Now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He appears, we may have confidence and not shrink away from Him in shame at His coming. 
1JN.2.29	If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone also who practices righteousness is born of Him.
1JN.3.1	See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we would be called children of God; and 
1JN.3.2	Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is. 
1JN.3.3	And everyone who has this hope 
1JN.3.4	Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. 
1JN.3.5	You know that He appeared in order to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin. 
1JN.3.6	No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him. 
1JN.3.7	Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; 
1JN.3.8	the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil. 
1JN.3.9	No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 
1JN.3.10	By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother.
1JN.3.11	For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another; 
1JN.3.12	not as Cain, 
1JN.3.13	Do not be surprised, brethren, if the world hates you. 
1JN.3.14	We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death. 
1JN.3.15	Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 
1JN.3.16	We know love by this, that He laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 
1JN.3.17	But whoever has the world’s goods, and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him? 
1JN.3.18	Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth. 
1JN.3.19	We will know by this that we are of the truth, and will assure our heart before Him 
1JN.3.20	in whatever our heart condemns us; for God is greater than our heart and knows all things. 
1JN.3.21	Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; 
1JN.3.22	and whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight.
1JN.3.23	This is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He commanded us. 
1JN.3.24	The one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. We know by this that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.
1JN.4.1	Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 
1JN.4.2	By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; 
1JN.4.3	and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the 
1JN.4.4	You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world. 
1JN.4.5	They are from the world; therefore they speak 
1JN.4.6	We are from God; he who knows God listens to us; he who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
1JN.4.7	Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. 
1JN.4.8	The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. 
1JN.4.9	By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him. 
1JN.4.10	In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son 
1JN.4.11	Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 
1JN.4.12	No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us. 
1JN.4.13	By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. 
1JN.4.14	We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son 
1JN.4.15	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 
1JN.4.16	We have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. 
1JN.4.17	By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this world. 
1JN.4.18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love. 
1JN.4.19	We love, because He first loved us. 
1JN.4.20	If someone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. 
1JN.4.21	And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also.
1JN.5.1	Whoever believes that Jesus is the 
1JN.5.2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and observe His commandments. 
1JN.5.3	For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome. 
1JN.5.4	For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith.
1JN.5.5	Who is the one who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 
1JN.5.6	This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 
1JN.5.7	For there are three that testify: 
1JN.5.8	the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement. 
1JN.5.9	If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for the testimony of God is this, that He has testified concerning His Son. 
1JN.5.10	The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son. 
1JN.5.11	And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. 
1JN.5.12	He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.
1JN.5.13	These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life. 
1JN.5.14	This is the confidence which we have before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. 
1JN.5.15	And if we know that He hears us 
1JN.5.16	If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not 
1JN.5.17	All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not 
1JN.5.18	We know that no one who is born of God sins; but He who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him. 
1JN.5.19	We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies in 
1JN.5.20	And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.
1JN.5.21	Little children, guard yourselves from idols.
2JN.1.1	The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not only I, but also all who know the truth, 
2JN.1.2	for the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever: 
2JN.1.3	Grace, mercy 
2JN.1.4	I was very glad to find 
2JN.1.5	Now I ask you, lady, not as though 
2JN.1.6	And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
2JN.1.7	For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ 
2JN.1.8	Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may receive a full reward. 
2JN.1.9	Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son. 
2JN.1.10	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into 
2JN.1.11	for the one who gives him a greeting participates in his evil deeds.
2JN.1.12	Though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to 
2JN.1.13	The children of your chosen sister greet you.
3JN.1.1	The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.
3JN.1.2	Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers. 
3JN.1.3	For I was very glad when brethren came and testified to your truth, 
3JN.1.4	I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.
3JN.1.5	Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brethren, and especially 
3JN.1.6	and they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God. 
3JN.1.7	For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles. 
3JN.1.8	Therefore we ought to support such men, so that we may be fellow workers with the truth.
3JN.1.9	I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept what we say. 
3JN.1.10	For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words; and not satisfied with this, he himself does not receive the brethren, either, and he forbids those who desire 
3JN.1.11	Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God. 
3JN.1.12	Demetrius has received a 
3JN.1.13	I had many things to write to you, but I am not willing to write 
3JN.1.14	but I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face.
3JN.1.15	Peace 
JUD.1.1	Jude, a bond-servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James,
JUD.1.2	May mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.
JUD.1.3	Beloved, while I was making every effort to write you about our common salvation, I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints. 
JUD.1.4	For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
JUD.1.5	Now I desire to remind you, though you know all things once for all, that 
JUD.1.6	And angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode, He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day, 
JUD.1.7	just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.
JUD.1.8	Yet in the same way these men, also by dreaming, defile the flesh, and reject authority, and revile angelic majesties. 
JUD.1.9	But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, “The Lord rebuke you!” 
JUD.1.10	But these men revile the things which they do not understand; and the things which they know by instinct, like unreasoning animals, by these things they are destroyed. 
JUD.1.11	Woe to them! For they have gone the way of Cain, and for pay they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and perished in the rebellion of Korah. 
JUD.1.12	These are the men who are hidden reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear, caring for themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead, uprooted; 
JUD.1.13	wild waves of the sea, casting up their own shame like foam; wandering stars, for whom the black darkness has been reserved forever.
JUD.1.15	to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.” 
JUD.1.16	These are grumblers, finding fault, following after their 
JUD.1.17	But you, beloved, ought to remember the words that were spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
JUD.1.18	that they were saying to you, “In the last time there will be mockers, following after their own ungodly lusts.” 
JUD.1.19	These are the ones who cause divisions, worldly-minded, devoid of the Spirit. 
JUD.1.20	But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, 
JUD.1.21	keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting anxiously for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life. 
JUD.1.22	And have mercy on some, who are doubting; 
JUD.1.23	save others, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the garment polluted by the flesh.
JUD.1.24	Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy, 
JUD.1.25	to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, 
REV.1.1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His bond-servants, the things which must soon take place; and He sent and communicated 
REV.1.2	who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, 
REV.1.3	Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near.
REV.1.4	John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, 
REV.1.5	and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and released us from our sins by His blood— 
REV.1.6	and He has made us 
REV.1.7	B
REV.1.9	I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance 
REV.1.10	I was 
REV.1.11	saying, 
REV.1.12	Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands; 
REV.1.13	and in the middle of the lampstands 
REV.1.14	His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire. 
REV.1.15	His feet 
REV.1.16	In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength.
REV.1.17	When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. And He placed His right hand on me, saying, 
REV.4.1	After these things I looked, and behold, a door 
REV.4.2	Immediately I was 
REV.4.3	And He who was sitting 
REV.4.4	Around the throne 
REV.4.5	Out from the throne come flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder. And 
REV.4.6	and before the throne 
REV.4.7	The first creature 
REV.4.8	And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within; and day and night they do not cease to say,
REV.4.8	“H
REV.4.9	And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever, 
REV.4.10	the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
REV.4.11	“Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.”
REV.5.1	I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals. 
REV.5.2	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals?” 
REV.5.3	And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it. 
REV.5.4	Then I 
REV.5.5	and one of the elders *said to me, “Stop weeping; behold, the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so as to open the book and its seven seals.”
REV.5.6	And I saw 
REV.5.7	And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. 
REV.5.8	When He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. 
REV.5.9	And they *sang a new song, saying,
REV.5.9	“Worthy are You to take the book and to break its seals; for You were slain, and purchased for God with Your blood 
REV.5.10	You have made them 
REV.5.11	Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands, 
REV.5.12	saying with a loud voice,
REV.5.12	“Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing.”
REV.5.13	And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying,
REV.5.13	“To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, 
REV.5.14	And the four living creatures kept saying, “Amen.” And the elders fell down and worshiped.
REV.6.1	Then I saw when the Lamb broke one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, “Come.” 
REV.6.2	I looked, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.
REV.6.3	When He broke the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come.” 
REV.6.4	And another, a red horse, went out; and to him who sat on it, it was granted to take peace from the earth, and that 
REV.6.5	When He broke the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, “Come.” I looked, and behold, a black horse; and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. 
REV.6.6	And I heard 
REV.6.7	When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, “Come.” 
REV.6.8	I looked, and behold, an ashen horse; and he who sat on it had the name Death; and Hades was following with him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth.
REV.6.9	When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony which they had maintained; 
REV.6.10	and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, “How long, O Lord, holy and true, will You refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” 
REV.6.11	And there was given to each of them a white robe; and they were told that they should rest for a little while longer, until 
REV.6.12	I looked when He broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth 
REV.6.13	and the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind. 
REV.6.14	The sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. 
REV.6.15	Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the 
REV.6.16	and they *said to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the presence of Him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; 
REV.6.17	for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”
REV.7.1	After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree. 
REV.7.2	And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea, 
REV.7.3	saying, “Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the bond-servants of our God on their foreheads.”
REV.7.4	And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:
REV.7.5	from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand 
REV.7.6	from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,
REV.7.7	from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,
REV.7.8	from the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, from the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand 
REV.7.9	After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could count, from every nation and 
REV.7.10	and they cry out with a loud voice, saying,
REV.7.10	“
REV.7.11	And all the angels were standing around the throne and 
REV.7.12	saying,
REV.7.12	“
REV.7.13	Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, “These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and where have they come from?” 
REV.7.14	I said to him, “My lord, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
REV.7.15	For this reason, they are before the throne of God; and they serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne will spread His tabernacle over them. 
REV.7.16	They will hunger no longer, nor thirst anymore; nor will the sun beat down on them, nor any heat; 
REV.7.17	for the Lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and will guide them to springs of the water of life; and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.”
REV.8.1	When the Lamb broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. 
REV.8.2	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
REV.8.3	Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, so that he might add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne. 
REV.8.4	And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand. 
REV.8.5	Then the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it to the earth; and there followed peals of thunder and sounds and flashes of lightning and an earthquake.
REV.8.6	And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.
REV.8.7	The first sounded, and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
REV.8.8	The second angel sounded, and 
REV.8.9	and a third of the creatures which were in the sea and had life, died; and a third of the ships were destroyed.
REV.8.10	The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters. 
REV.8.11	The name of the star is called Wormwood; and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.
REV.8.12	The fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck, so that a third of them would be darkened and the day would not shine for a third of it, and the night in the same way.
REV.8.13	Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice, “Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!”
REV.9.1	Then the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth; and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him. 
REV.9.2	He opened the bottomless pit, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit. 
REV.9.3	Then out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. 
REV.9.4	They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 
REV.9.5	And they were not permitted to kill anyone, but to torment for five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a man. 
REV.9.6	And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death flees from them.
REV.9.7	The appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle; and on their heads appeared to be crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men. 
REV.9.8	They had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like 
REV.9.9	They had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to battle. 
REV.9.10	They have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men for five months. 
REV.9.11	They have as king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is 
REV.9.12	The first woe is past; behold, two woes are still coming after these things.
REV.9.13	Then the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the 
REV.9.14	one saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” 
REV.9.15	And the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released, so that they would kill a third of mankind. 
REV.9.16	The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million; I heard the number of them. 
REV.9.17	And this is how I saw in the vision the horses and those who sat on them: 
REV.9.18	A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which proceeded out of their mouths. 
REV.9.19	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they do harm.
REV.9.20	The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so as not to worship demons, and the idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk; 
REV.9.21	and they did not repent of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their immorality nor of their thefts.
REV.10.1	I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire; 
REV.10.2	and he had in his hand a little book which was open. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left on the land; 
REV.10.3	and he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars; and when he had cried out, the seven peals of thunder uttered their voices. 
REV.10.4	When the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have spoken and do not write them.” 
REV.10.5	Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to heaven, 
REV.10.6	and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, 
REV.10.7	but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as He preached to His servants the prophets.
REV.10.8	Then the voice which I heard from heaven, 
REV.10.9	So I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he *said to me, “Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.” 
REV.10.10	I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter. 
REV.10.11	And they *said to me, “You must prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.”
REV.11.1	Then there was given me a measuring rod like a staff; and someone said, “Get up and measure the temple of God and the altar, and those who worship in it. 
REV.11.2	Leave out the court which is outside the temple and do not measure it, for it has been given to the nations; and they will tread under foot the holy city for forty-two months. 
REV.11.3	And I will grant 
REV.11.4	These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. 
REV.11.5	And if anyone wants to harm them, fire flows out of their mouth and devours their enemies; so if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way. 
REV.11.6	These have the power to shut up the sky, so that rain will not fall during the days of their prophesying; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.
REV.11.7	When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them and kill them. 
REV.11.8	And their dead bodies 
REV.11.9	Those from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations 
REV.11.10	And those who dwell on the earth 
REV.11.11	But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God came into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those who were watching them. 
REV.11.12	And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” Then they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies watched them. 
REV.11.13	And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
REV.11.14	The second woe is past; behold, the third woe is coming quickly.
REV.11.15	Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying,
REV.11.15	“
REV.11.16	And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God, 
REV.11.17	saying,
REV.11.17	“
REV.11.18	And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came, and the time 
REV.11.19	And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened; and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple, and there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm.
REV.12.1	A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; 
REV.12.2	and she was with child; and she *cried out, being in labor and in pain to give birth.
REV.12.3	Then another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads 
REV.12.4	And his tail *swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.
REV.12.5	And she gave birth to a son, a male 
REV.12.6	Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she *had a place prepared by God, so that there she would be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.
REV.12.7	And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war, 
REV.12.8	and they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven. 
REV.12.9	And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. 
REV.12.10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying,
REV.12.10	“
REV.12.11	And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even when faced with death. 
REV.12.12	For this reason, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has 
REV.12.13	And when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male 
REV.12.14	But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she could fly into the wilderness to her place, where she *was nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent. 
REV.12.15	And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, so that he might cause her to be swept away with the flood. 
REV.12.16	But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon poured out of his mouth. 
REV.12.17	So the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to make war with the rest of her children, who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.
REV.13.1	And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore.
REV.13.2	And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like 
REV.13.3	 one of his heads as if it had been slain, and his fatal wound was healed. And the whole earth was amazed 
REV.13.4	they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who is able to wage war with him?” 
REV.13.5	There was given to him a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies, and authority to act for forty-two months was given to him. 
REV.13.6	And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, 
REV.13.7	It was also given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him. 
REV.13.8	All who dwell on the earth will worship him, 
REV.13.9	If anyone has an ear, let him hear. 
REV.13.10	If anyone 
REV.13.11	Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon. 
REV.13.12	He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed. 
REV.13.13	He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the presence of men. 
REV.13.14	And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to perform in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who *had the wound of the sword and has come to life. 
REV.13.15	And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast would even 
REV.13.16	And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, 
REV.13.17	and 
REV.13.18	Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is 
REV.14.1	Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb 
REV.14.2	And I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice which I heard 
REV.14.3	And they *sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth. 
REV.14.4	These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they 
REV.14.5	And no lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless.
REV.14.6	And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal gospel to preach to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people; 
REV.14.7	and he said with a loud voice, “Fear God, and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; worship Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters.”
REV.14.8	And another angel, a second one, followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the passion of her immorality.”
REV.14.9	Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, 
REV.14.10	he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. 
REV.14.11	And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.” 
REV.14.12	Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.
REV.14.13	And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, “Write, ‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!’ ” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “so that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow with them.”
REV.14.14	Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud 
REV.14.15	And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, “Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.” 
REV.14.16	Then He who sat on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.
REV.14.17	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle. 
REV.14.18	Then another angel, the one who has power over fire, came out from the altar; and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, “Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe.” 
REV.14.19	So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered 
REV.14.20	And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood came out from the wine press, up to the horses’ bridles, for a distance of 
REV.15.1	Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels who had seven plagues, 
REV.15.2	And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of God. 
REV.15.3	And they *sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,
REV.15.3	“
REV.15.3	O Lord God, the Almighty;
REV.15.3	Righteous and true are Your ways,
REV.15.3	King of the 
REV.15.4	Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Your name?
REV.15.4	For You alone are holy;
REV.15.4	For 
REV.15.4	F
REV.15.5	After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened, 
REV.15.6	and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in 
REV.15.7	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever. 
REV.15.8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
REV.16.1	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.”
REV.16.2	So the first 
REV.16.3	The second 
REV.16.4	Then the third 
REV.16.5	And I heard the angel of the waters saying, “Righteous are You, who are and who were, O Holy One, because You judged these things; 
REV.16.6	for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink. They deserve it.” 
REV.16.7	And I heard the altar saying, “Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.”
REV.16.8	The fourth 
REV.16.9	Men were scorched with fierce heat; and they blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory.
REV.16.10	Then the fifth 
REV.16.11	and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they did not repent of their deeds.
REV.16.12	The sixth 
REV.16.13	And I saw 
REV.16.14	for they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty. 
REV.16.15	(“Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his clothes, so that he will not walk about naked and men will not see his shame.”) 
REV.16.16	And they gathered them together to the place which in Hebrew is called 
REV.16.17	Then the seventh 
REV.16.18	And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been since man came to be upon the earth, so great an earthquake 
REV.16.19	The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of His fierce wrath. 
REV.16.20	And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. 
REV.16.21	And huge hailstones, about 
REV.17.1	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, “Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters, 
REV.17.2	with whom the kings of the earth committed 
REV.17.3	And he carried me away 
REV.17.4	The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a gold cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality, 
REV.17.5	and on her forehead a name 
REV.17.6	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered greatly. 
REV.17.7	And the angel said to me, “Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.
REV.17.8	“The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and 
REV.17.9	Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits, 
REV.17.10	and they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while. 
REV.17.11	The beast which was and is not, is himself also an eighth and is 
REV.17.12	The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour. 
REV.17.13	These have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast.
REV.17.14	These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with Him 
REV.17.15	And he *said to me, “The waters which you saw where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues. 
REV.17.16	And the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire. 
REV.17.17	For God has put it in their hearts to execute His purpose by having a common purpose, and by giving their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God will be fulfilled. 
REV.17.18	The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.”
REV.18.1	After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illumined with his glory. 
REV.18.2	And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a dwelling place of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird. 
REV.18.3	For all the nations 
REV.18.4	I heard another voice from heaven, saying, “Come out of her, my people, so that you will not participate in her sins and receive of her plagues; 
REV.18.5	for her sins have piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities. 
REV.18.6	Pay her back even as she has paid, and give back 
REV.18.7	To the degree that she glorified herself and lived sensuously, to the same degree give her torment and mourning; for she says in her heart, ‘I 
REV.18.8	For this reason in one day her plagues will come, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for the Lord God who judges her is strong.
REV.18.9	“And the kings of the earth, who committed 
REV.18.10	standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For in one hour your judgment has come.’
REV.18.11	“And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargoes any more— 
REV.18.12	cargoes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every 
REV.18.13	and cinnamon and spice and incense and perfume and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and 
REV.18.14	The fruit you long for has gone from you, and all things that were luxurious and splendid have passed away from you and 
REV.18.15	The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, 
REV.18.16	saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, she who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls; 
REV.18.17	for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!’ And every shipmaster and every passenger and sailor, and as many as make their living by the sea, stood at a distance, 
REV.18.18	and were crying out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What 
REV.18.19	And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had ships at sea became rich by her wealth, for in one hour she has been laid waste!’ 
REV.18.20	Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her.”
REV.18.21	Then a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, “So will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, and will not be found any longer. 
REV.18.22	And the sound of harpists and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters will not be heard in you any longer; and no craftsman of any craft will be found in you any longer; and the sound of a mill will not be heard in you any longer; 
REV.18.23	and the light of a lamp will not shine in you any longer; and the voice of the bridegroom and bride will not be heard in you any longer; for your merchants were the great men of the earth, because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery. 
REV.18.24	And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on the earth.”
REV.19.1	After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying,
REV.19.1	“
REV.19.2	 H
REV.19.3	And a second time they said, “Hallelujah! H
REV.19.4	And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne saying, “Amen. Hallelujah!” 
REV.19.5	And a voice came from the throne, saying,
REV.19.5	“
REV.19.6	Then I heard 
REV.19.6	“
REV.19.7	Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready.” 
REV.19.8	It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright 
REV.19.9	Then he *said to me, “Write, ‘Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.’ ” And he *said to me, “These are true words of God.” 
REV.19.10	Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he *said to me, “Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”
REV.19.11	And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sat on it 
REV.19.12	His eyes 
REV.19.13	 clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. 
REV.19.14	And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white 
REV.19.15	From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty. 
REV.19.16	And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, “KING OF KINGS, AND 
REV.19.17	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, “Come, assemble for the great supper of God, 
REV.19.18	so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of 
REV.19.19	And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army.
REV.19.20	And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone. 
REV.19.21	And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
REV.20.1	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. 
REV.20.2	And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; 
REV.20.3	and he threw him into the abyss, and shut 
REV.20.4	Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I 
REV.20.5	The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection. 
REV.20.6	Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.
REV.20.7	When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison, 
REV.20.8	and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore. 
REV.20.9	And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them. 
REV.20.10	And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
REV.20.11	Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. 
REV.20.12	And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is 
REV.20.13	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one 
REV.20.14	Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. 
REV.20.15	And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
REV.21.1	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer 
REV.21.2	And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband. 
REV.21.3	And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them
REV.21.4	and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be 
REV.21.5	And He who sits on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” And He *said, “Write, for these words are faithful and true.” 
REV.21.6	Then He said to me, “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost. 
REV.21.7	He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son. 
REV.21.8	But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part 
REV.21.9	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, “Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”
REV.21.10	And he carried me away 
REV.21.11	having the glory of God. Her brilliance was like a very costly stone, as a stone of crystal-clear jasper. 
REV.21.12	It had a great and high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names 
REV.21.13	 three gates on the east and three gates on the north and three gates on the south and three gates on the west. 
REV.21.14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them 
REV.21.15	The one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, and its gates and its wall. 
REV.21.16	The city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as the width; and he measured the city with the rod, 
REV.21.17	And he measured its wall, 
REV.21.18	The material of the wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass. 
REV.21.19	The foundation stones of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; 
REV.21.20	the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. 
REV.21.21	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
REV.21.22	I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 
REV.21.23	And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp 
REV.21.24	The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. 
REV.21.25	In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be closed; 
REV.21.26	and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it; 
REV.21.27	and nothing unclean, and no one who practices abomination and lying, shall ever come into it, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
REV.22.1	Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of 
REV.22.2	in the middle of its street. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve 
REV.22.3	There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him; 
REV.22.4	they will see His face, and His name 
REV.22.5	And there will no longer be
