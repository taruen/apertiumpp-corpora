GEN.1.1	In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
GEN.1.2	And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
GEN.1.3	And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
GEN.1.4	And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
GEN.1.5	And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
GEN.1.6	And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
GEN.1.7	And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
GEN.1.8	And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
GEN.1.9	And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
GEN.1.10	And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.11	And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
GEN.1.12	And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.13	And the evening and the morning were the third day.
GEN.1.14	And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
GEN.1.15	And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
GEN.1.16	And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
GEN.1.17	And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
GEN.1.18	And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.19	And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
GEN.1.20	And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
GEN.1.21	And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.22	And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
GEN.1.23	And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
GEN.1.24	And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
GEN.1.25	And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.26	And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
GEN.1.27	So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
GEN.1.28	And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
GEN.1.29	And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
GEN.1.30	And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
GEN.1.31	And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
GEN.2.1	Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
GEN.2.2	And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
GEN.2.3	And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
GEN.2.4	These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the 
GEN.2.5	And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the 
GEN.2.6	But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
GEN.2.7	And the 
GEN.2.8	And the 
GEN.2.9	And out of the ground made the 
GEN.2.10	And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
GEN.2.11	The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
GEN.2.12	And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
GEN.2.13	And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
GEN.2.14	And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
GEN.2.15	And the 
GEN.2.16	And the 
GEN.2.17	But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
GEN.2.18	And the 
GEN.2.19	And out of the ground the 
GEN.2.20	And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
GEN.2.21	And the 
GEN.2.22	And the rib, which the 
GEN.2.23	And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
GEN.2.24	Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
GEN.2.25	And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
GEN.3.1	Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the 
GEN.3.2	And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
GEN.3.3	But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
GEN.3.4	And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
GEN.3.5	For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
GEN.3.6	And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
GEN.3.7	And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
GEN.3.8	And they heard the voice of the 
GEN.3.9	And the 
GEN.3.10	And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
GEN.3.11	And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
GEN.3.12	And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
GEN.3.13	And the 
GEN.3.14	And the 
GEN.3.15	And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
GEN.3.16	Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
GEN.3.17	And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
GEN.3.18	Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
GEN.3.19	In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
GEN.3.20	And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
GEN.3.21	Unto Adam also and to his wife did the 
GEN.3.22	And the 
GEN.3.23	Therefore the 
GEN.3.24	So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
GEN.4.1	And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the 
GEN.4.2	And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
GEN.4.3	And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the 
GEN.4.4	And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the 
GEN.4.5	But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
GEN.4.6	And the 
GEN.4.7	If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
GEN.4.8	And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
GEN.4.9	And the 
GEN.4.10	And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.
GEN.4.11	And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
GEN.4.12	When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
GEN.4.13	And Cain said unto the 
GEN.4.14	Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.
GEN.4.15	And the 
GEN.4.16	And Cain went out from the presence of the 
GEN.4.17	And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
GEN.4.18	And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
GEN.4.19	And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
GEN.4.20	And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.
GEN.4.21	And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
GEN.4.22	And Zillah, she also bare Tubal–cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal–cain was Naamah.
GEN.4.23	And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
GEN.4.24	If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
GEN.4.25	And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
GEN.4.26	And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the 
GEN.5.1	This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;
GEN.5.2	Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
GEN.5.3	And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:
GEN.5.4	And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:
GEN.5.5	And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
GEN.5.6	And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:
GEN.5.7	And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:
GEN.5.8	And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.
GEN.5.9	And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:
GEN.5.10	And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:
GEN.5.11	And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.
GEN.5.12	And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel:
GEN.5.13	And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:
GEN.5.14	And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.
GEN.5.15	And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:
GEN.5.16	And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:
GEN.5.17	And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.
GEN.5.18	And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:
GEN.5.19	And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
GEN.5.20	And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.
GEN.5.21	And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:
GEN.5.22	And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
GEN.5.23	And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
GEN.5.24	And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.
GEN.5.25	And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:
GEN.5.26	And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:
GEN.5.27	And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
GEN.5.28	And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:
GEN.5.29	And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the 
GEN.5.30	And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:
GEN.5.31	And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.
GEN.5.32	And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.1	And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
GEN.6.2	That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
GEN.6.3	And the 
GEN.6.4	There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
GEN.6.5	And 
GEN.6.6	And it repented the 
GEN.6.7	And the 
GEN.6.8	But Noah found grace in the eyes of the 
GEN.6.9	These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
GEN.6.10	And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.11	The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
GEN.6.12	And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
GEN.6.13	And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
GEN.6.14	Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
GEN.6.15	And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
GEN.6.16	A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
GEN.6.17	And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
GEN.6.18	But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
GEN.6.19	And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
GEN.6.20	Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
GEN.6.21	And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
GEN.6.22	Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
GEN.7.1	And the 
GEN.7.2	Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.
GEN.7.3	Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
GEN.7.4	For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.
GEN.7.5	And Noah did according unto all that the 
GEN.7.6	And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
GEN.7.7	And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
GEN.7.8	Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,
GEN.7.9	There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.
GEN.7.10	And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
GEN.7.11	In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
GEN.7.12	And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
GEN.7.13	In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;
GEN.7.14	They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
GEN.7.15	And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.
GEN.7.16	And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the 
GEN.7.17	And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
GEN.7.18	And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
GEN.7.19	And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
GEN.7.20	Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
GEN.7.21	And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
GEN.7.22	All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.
GEN.7.23	And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.
GEN.7.24	And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
GEN.8.1	And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;
GEN.8.2	The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
GEN.8.3	And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
GEN.8.4	And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
GEN.8.5	And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
GEN.8.6	And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:
GEN.8.7	And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
GEN.8.8	Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
GEN.8.9	But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
GEN.8.10	And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
GEN.8.11	And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
GEN.8.12	And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
GEN.8.13	And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
GEN.8.14	And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
GEN.8.15	And God spake unto Noah, saying,
GEN.8.16	Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
GEN.8.17	Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
GEN.8.18	And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:
GEN.8.19	Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
GEN.8.20	And Noah builded an altar unto the 
GEN.8.21	And the 
GEN.8.22	While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
GEN.9.1	And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
GEN.9.2	And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
GEN.9.3	Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
GEN.9.4	But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
GEN.9.5	And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
GEN.9.6	Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.
GEN.9.7	And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
GEN.9.8	And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
GEN.9.9	And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
GEN.9.10	And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
GEN.9.11	And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
GEN.9.12	And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
GEN.9.13	I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
GEN.9.14	And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:
GEN.9.15	And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
GEN.9.16	And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
GEN.9.17	And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
GEN.9.18	And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
GEN.9.19	These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
GEN.9.20	And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
GEN.9.21	And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
GEN.9.22	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
GEN.9.23	And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
GEN.9.24	And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
GEN.9.25	And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
GEN.9.26	And he said, Blessed be the 
GEN.9.27	God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
GEN.9.28	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
GEN.9.29	And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
GEN.10.1	Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.
GEN.10.2	The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
GEN.10.3	And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
GEN.10.4	And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
GEN.10.5	By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
GEN.10.6	And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.
GEN.10.7	And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.
GEN.10.8	And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
GEN.10.9	He was a mighty hunter before the 
GEN.10.10	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
GEN.10.11	Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
GEN.10.12	And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.
GEN.10.13	And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
GEN.10.14	And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came the Philistines,) and Caphtorim.
GEN.10.15	And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,
GEN.10.16	And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,
GEN.10.17	And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
GEN.10.18	And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
GEN.10.19	And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboiim, even unto Lasha.
GEN.10.20	These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.
GEN.10.21	Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.
GEN.10.22	The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
GEN.10.23	And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
GEN.10.24	And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
GEN.10.25	And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.
GEN.10.26	And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
GEN.10.27	And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
GEN.10.28	And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
GEN.10.29	And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.
GEN.10.30	And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.
GEN.10.31	These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
GEN.10.32	These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
GEN.11.1	And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
GEN.11.2	And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
GEN.11.3	And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.
GEN.11.4	And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
GEN.11.5	And the 
GEN.11.6	And the 
GEN.11.7	Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
GEN.11.8	So the 
GEN.11.9	Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the 
GEN.11.10	These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:
GEN.11.11	And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.12	And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:
GEN.11.13	And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.14	And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:
GEN.11.15	And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.16	And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:
GEN.11.17	And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.18	And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:
GEN.11.19	And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.20	And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:
GEN.11.21	And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.22	And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:
GEN.11.23	And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.24	And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:
GEN.11.25	And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.26	And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
GEN.11.27	Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.
GEN.11.28	And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
GEN.11.29	And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
GEN.11.30	But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
GEN.11.31	And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
GEN.11.32	And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
GEN.12.1	Now the 
GEN.12.2	And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
GEN.12.3	And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
GEN.12.4	So Abram departed, as the 
GEN.12.5	And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
GEN.12.6	And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
GEN.12.7	And the 
GEN.12.8	And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the 
GEN.12.9	And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
GEN.12.10	And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
GEN.12.11	And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
GEN.12.12	Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
GEN.12.13	Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
GEN.12.14	And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
GEN.12.15	The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
GEN.12.16	And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
GEN.12.17	And the 
GEN.12.18	And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
GEN.12.19	Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
GEN.12.20	And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.
GEN.13.1	And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
GEN.13.2	And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
GEN.13.3	And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
GEN.13.4	Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the 
GEN.13.5	And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
GEN.13.6	And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
GEN.13.7	And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
GEN.13.8	And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.
GEN.13.9	Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
GEN.13.10	And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the 
GEN.13.11	Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
GEN.13.12	Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
GEN.13.13	But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the 
GEN.13.14	And the 
GEN.13.15	For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
GEN.13.16	And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
GEN.13.17	Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.
GEN.13.18	Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the 
GEN.14.1	And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
GEN.14.2	That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
GEN.14.3	All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.
GEN.14.4	Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
GEN.14.5	And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
GEN.14.6	And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El–paran, which is by the wilderness.
GEN.14.7	And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
GEN.14.8	And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
GEN.14.9	With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
GEN.14.10	And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
GEN.14.11	And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
GEN.14.12	And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
GEN.14.13	And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
GEN.14.14	And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
GEN.14.15	And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
GEN.14.16	And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
GEN.14.17	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
GEN.14.18	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
GEN.14.19	And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
GEN.14.20	And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
GEN.14.21	And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
GEN.14.22	And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the 
GEN.14.23	That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
GEN.14.24	Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
GEN.15.1	After these things the word of the 
GEN.15.2	And Abram said, Lord 
GEN.15.3	And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
GEN.15.4	And, behold, the word of the 
GEN.15.5	And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
GEN.15.6	And he believed in the 
GEN.15.7	And he said unto him, I am the 
GEN.15.8	And he said, Lord 
GEN.15.9	And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
GEN.15.10	And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
GEN.15.11	And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.
GEN.15.12	And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
GEN.15.13	And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
GEN.15.14	And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
GEN.15.15	And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
GEN.15.16	But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
GEN.15.17	And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
GEN.15.18	In the same day the 
GEN.15.19	The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
GEN.15.20	And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,
GEN.15.21	And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
GEN.16.1	Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
GEN.16.2	And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the 
GEN.16.3	And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
GEN.16.4	And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
GEN.16.5	And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the 
GEN.16.6	But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.
GEN.16.7	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.8	And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.
GEN.16.9	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.10	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.11	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.12	And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
GEN.16.13	And she called the name of the 
GEN.16.14	Wherefore the well was called Beer–lahai–roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
GEN.16.15	And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.
GEN.16.16	And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
GEN.17.1	And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the 
GEN.17.2	And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
GEN.17.3	And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
GEN.17.4	As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.
GEN.17.5	Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.
GEN.17.6	And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
GEN.17.7	And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
GEN.17.8	And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
GEN.17.9	And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.
GEN.17.10	This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
GEN.17.11	And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
GEN.17.12	And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.
GEN.17.13	He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
GEN.17.14	And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
GEN.17.15	And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
GEN.17.16	And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.
GEN.17.17	Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
GEN.17.18	And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!
GEN.17.19	And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
GEN.17.20	And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
GEN.17.21	But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
GEN.17.22	And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
GEN.17.23	And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
GEN.17.24	And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
GEN.17.25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
GEN.17.26	In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
GEN.17.27	And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
GEN.18.1	And the 
GEN.18.2	And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
GEN.18.3	And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
GEN.18.4	Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
GEN.18.5	And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
GEN.18.6	And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.
GEN.18.7	And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
GEN.18.8	And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
GEN.18.9	And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
GEN.18.10	And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
GEN.18.11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
GEN.18.12	Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
GEN.18.13	And the 
GEN.18.14	Is any thing too hard for the 
GEN.18.15	Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
GEN.18.16	And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
GEN.18.17	And the 
GEN.18.18	Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
GEN.18.19	For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the 
GEN.18.20	And the 
GEN.18.21	I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
GEN.18.22	And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the 
GEN.18.23	And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
GEN.18.24	Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
GEN.18.25	That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
GEN.18.26	And the 
GEN.18.27	And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:
GEN.18.28	Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.
GEN.18.29	And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.
GEN.18.30	And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
GEN.18.31	And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.
GEN.18.32	And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.
GEN.18.33	And the 
GEN.19.1	And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
GEN.19.2	And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
GEN.19.3	And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
GEN.19.4	But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
GEN.19.5	And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
GEN.19.6	And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,
GEN.19.7	And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
GEN.19.8	Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
GEN.19.9	And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
GEN.19.10	But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
GEN.19.11	And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
GEN.19.12	And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
GEN.19.13	For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the 
GEN.19.14	And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the 
GEN.19.15	And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
GEN.19.16	And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the 
GEN.19.17	And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
GEN.19.18	And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:
GEN.19.19	Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
GEN.19.20	Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
GEN.19.21	And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
GEN.19.22	Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
GEN.19.23	The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
GEN.19.24	Then the 
GEN.19.25	And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
GEN.19.26	But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
GEN.19.27	And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the 
GEN.19.28	And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
GEN.19.29	And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
GEN.19.30	And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
GEN.19.31	And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
GEN.19.32	Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
GEN.19.33	And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
GEN.19.34	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
GEN.19.35	And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
GEN.19.36	Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
GEN.19.37	And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
GEN.19.38	And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
GEN.20.1	And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
GEN.20.2	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
GEN.20.3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.
GEN.20.4	But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?
GEN.20.5	Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.
GEN.20.6	And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
GEN.20.7	Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
GEN.20.8	Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
GEN.20.9	Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
GEN.20.10	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
GEN.20.11	And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
GEN.20.12	And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
GEN.20.13	And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
GEN.20.14	And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
GEN.20.15	And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.
GEN.20.16	And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.
GEN.20.17	So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.
GEN.20.18	For the 
GEN.21.1	And the 
GEN.21.2	For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
GEN.21.3	And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
GEN.21.4	And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
GEN.21.5	And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
GEN.21.6	And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.
GEN.21.7	And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.
GEN.21.8	And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.
GEN.21.9	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
GEN.21.10	Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
GEN.21.11	And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
GEN.21.12	And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
GEN.21.13	And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
GEN.21.14	And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
GEN.21.15	And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
GEN.21.16	And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
GEN.21.17	And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
GEN.21.18	Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
GEN.21.19	And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
GEN.21.20	And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
GEN.21.21	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
GEN.21.22	And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
GEN.21.23	Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
GEN.21.24	And Abraham said, I will swear.
GEN.21.25	And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
GEN.21.26	And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.
GEN.21.27	And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
GEN.21.28	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
GEN.21.29	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
GEN.21.30	And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.
GEN.21.31	Wherefore he called that place Beer–sheba; because there they sware both of them.
GEN.21.32	Thus they made a covenant at Beer–sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
GEN.21.33	And Abraham planted a grove in Beer–sheba, and called there on the name of the 
GEN.21.34	And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
GEN.22.1	And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
GEN.22.2	And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
GEN.22.3	And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
GEN.22.4	Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
GEN.22.5	And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
GEN.22.6	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
GEN.22.7	And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
GEN.22.8	And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
GEN.22.9	And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
GEN.22.10	And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
GEN.22.11	And the angel of the 
GEN.22.12	And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
GEN.22.13	And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
GEN.22.14	And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the 
GEN.22.15	And the angel of the 
GEN.22.16	And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the 
GEN.22.17	That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
GEN.22.18	And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
GEN.22.19	So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
GEN.22.20	And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
GEN.22.21	Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
GEN.22.22	And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
GEN.22.23	And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
GEN.22.24	And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.
GEN.23.1	And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.
GEN.23.2	And Sarah died in Kirjath–arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
GEN.23.3	And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,
GEN.23.4	I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
GEN.23.5	And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
GEN.23.6	Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
GEN.23.7	And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
GEN.23.8	And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
GEN.23.9	That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.
GEN.23.10	And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
GEN.23.11	Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
GEN.23.12	And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
GEN.23.13	And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
GEN.23.14	And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
GEN.23.15	My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
GEN.23.16	And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
GEN.23.17	And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
GEN.23.18	Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
GEN.23.19	And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
GEN.23.20	And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.
GEN.24.1	And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the 
GEN.24.2	And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
GEN.24.3	And I will make thee swear by the 
GEN.24.4	But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.
GEN.24.5	And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?
GEN.24.6	And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
GEN.24.7	The 
GEN.24.8	And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.
GEN.24.9	And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.
GEN.24.10	And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
GEN.24.11	And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.
GEN.24.12	And he said, O 
GEN.24.13	Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:
GEN.24.14	And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.
GEN.24.15	And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
GEN.24.16	And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
GEN.24.17	And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.
GEN.24.18	And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
GEN.24.19	And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
GEN.24.20	And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.
GEN.24.21	And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the 
GEN.24.22	And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;
GEN.24.23	And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?
GEN.24.24	And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.
GEN.24.25	She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
GEN.24.26	And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the 
GEN.24.27	And he said, Blessed be the 
GEN.24.28	And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.
GEN.24.29	And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.
GEN.24.30	And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
GEN.24.31	And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the 
GEN.24.32	And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.
GEN.24.33	And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.
GEN.24.34	And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
GEN.24.35	And the 
GEN.24.36	And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.
GEN.24.37	And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
GEN.24.38	But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.
GEN.24.39	And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
GEN.24.40	And he said unto me, The 
GEN.24.41	Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
GEN.24.42	And I came this day unto the well, and said, O 
GEN.24.43	Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
GEN.24.44	And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the 
GEN.24.45	And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
GEN.24.46	And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
GEN.24.47	And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
GEN.24.48	And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the 
GEN.24.49	And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
GEN.24.50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the 
GEN.24.51	Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the 
GEN.24.52	And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the 
GEN.24.53	And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
GEN.24.54	And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
GEN.24.55	And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
GEN.24.56	And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the 
GEN.24.57	And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.
GEN.24.58	And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
GEN.24.59	And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
GEN.24.60	And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.
GEN.24.61	And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
GEN.24.62	And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai–roi; for he dwelt in the south country.
GEN.24.63	And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.
GEN.24.64	And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
GEN.24.65	For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a veil, and covered herself.
GEN.24.66	And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
GEN.24.67	And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
GEN.25.1	Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.
GEN.25.2	And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
GEN.25.3	And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
GEN.25.4	And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
GEN.25.5	And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
GEN.25.6	But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
GEN.25.7	And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.
GEN.25.8	Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
GEN.25.9	And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;
GEN.25.10	The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
GEN.25.11	And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai–roi.
GEN.25.12	Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:
GEN.25.13	And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
GEN.25.14	And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
GEN.25.15	Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
GEN.25.16	These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
GEN.25.17	And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
GEN.25.18	And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.
GEN.25.19	And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:
GEN.25.20	And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan–aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
GEN.25.21	And Isaac entreated the 
GEN.25.22	And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the 
GEN.25.23	And the 
GEN.25.24	And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
GEN.25.25	And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
GEN.25.26	And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
GEN.25.27	And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
GEN.25.28	And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
GEN.25.29	And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:
GEN.25.30	And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
GEN.25.31	And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
GEN.25.32	And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
GEN.25.33	And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
GEN.25.34	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.
GEN.26.1	And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.
GEN.26.2	And the 
GEN.26.3	Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;
GEN.26.4	And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
GEN.26.5	Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
GEN.26.6	And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
GEN.26.7	And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.
GEN.26.8	And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
GEN.26.9	And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.
GEN.26.10	And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
GEN.26.11	And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
GEN.26.12	Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the 
GEN.26.13	And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
GEN.26.14	For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.
GEN.26.15	For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
GEN.26.16	And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.
GEN.26.17	And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
GEN.26.18	And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
GEN.26.19	And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
GEN.26.20	And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
GEN.26.21	And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
GEN.26.22	And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the 
GEN.26.23	And he went up from thence to Beer–sheba.
GEN.26.24	And the 
GEN.26.25	And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the 
GEN.26.26	Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
GEN.26.27	And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
GEN.26.28	And they said, We saw certainly that the 
GEN.26.29	That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the 
GEN.26.30	And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
GEN.26.31	And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
GEN.26.32	And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
GEN.26.33	And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beer–sheba unto this day.
GEN.26.34	And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:
GEN.26.35	Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
GEN.27.1	And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.
GEN.27.2	And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:
GEN.27.3	Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;
GEN.27.4	And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.
GEN.27.5	And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
GEN.27.6	And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,
GEN.27.7	Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the 
GEN.27.8	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
GEN.27.9	Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:
GEN.27.10	And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.
GEN.27.11	And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:
GEN.27.12	My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
GEN.27.13	And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.
GEN.27.14	And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.
GEN.27.15	And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:
GEN.27.16	And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:
GEN.27.17	And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
GEN.27.18	And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?
GEN.27.19	And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
GEN.27.20	And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the 
GEN.27.21	And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.
GEN.27.22	And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
GEN.27.23	And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.
GEN.27.24	And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
GEN.27.25	And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.
GEN.27.26	And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
GEN.27.27	And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the 
GEN.27.28	Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:
GEN.27.29	Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.
GEN.27.30	And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
GEN.27.31	And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.
GEN.27.32	And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.
GEN.27.33	And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.
GEN.27.34	And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.
GEN.27.35	And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.
GEN.27.36	And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
GEN.27.37	And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?
GEN.27.38	And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
GEN.27.39	And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;
GEN.27.40	And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
GEN.27.41	And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
GEN.27.42	And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.
GEN.27.43	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
GEN.27.44	And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;
GEN.27.45	Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?
GEN.27.46	And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?
GEN.28.1	And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
GEN.28.2	Arise, go to Paddan–aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.
GEN.28.3	And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;
GEN.28.4	And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.
GEN.28.5	And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Paddan–aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
GEN.28.6	When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Paddan–aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
GEN.28.7	And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan–aram;
GEN.28.8	And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
GEN.28.9	Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
GEN.28.10	And Jacob went out from Beer–sheba, and went toward Haran.
GEN.28.11	And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
GEN.28.12	And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
GEN.28.13	And, behold, the 
GEN.28.14	And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
GEN.28.15	And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.
GEN.28.16	And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the 
GEN.28.17	And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
GEN.28.18	And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
GEN.28.19	And he called the name of that place Beth–el: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.
GEN.28.20	And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
GEN.28.21	So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the 
GEN.28.22	And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.
GEN.29.1	Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.
GEN.29.2	And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.
GEN.29.3	And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.
GEN.29.4	And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.
GEN.29.5	And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.
GEN.29.6	And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
GEN.29.7	And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
GEN.29.8	And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.
GEN.29.9	And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them.
GEN.29.10	And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
GEN.29.11	And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
GEN.29.12	And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.
GEN.29.13	And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
GEN.29.14	And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
GEN.29.15	And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?
GEN.29.16	And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
GEN.29.17	Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
GEN.29.18	And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
GEN.29.19	And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
GEN.29.20	And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
GEN.29.21	And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
GEN.29.22	And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
GEN.29.23	And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.
GEN.29.24	And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.
GEN.29.25	And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
GEN.29.26	And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
GEN.29.27	Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
GEN.29.28	And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.
GEN.29.29	And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
GEN.29.30	And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
GEN.29.31	And when the 
GEN.29.32	And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the 
GEN.29.33	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the 
GEN.29.34	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.
GEN.29.35	And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the 
GEN.30.1	And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.
GEN.30.2	And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
GEN.30.3	And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.
GEN.30.4	And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
GEN.30.5	And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.
GEN.30.6	And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.
GEN.30.7	And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.
GEN.30.8	And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.
GEN.30.9	When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.
GEN.30.10	And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.
GEN.30.11	And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.
GEN.30.12	And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.
GEN.30.13	And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.
GEN.30.14	And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.
GEN.30.15	And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.
GEN.30.16	And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
GEN.30.17	And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.
GEN.30.18	And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.
GEN.30.19	And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.
GEN.30.20	And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.
GEN.30.21	And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
GEN.30.22	And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
GEN.30.23	And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:
GEN.30.24	And she called his name Joseph; and said, The 
GEN.30.25	And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.
GEN.30.26	Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.
GEN.30.27	And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the 
GEN.30.28	And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
GEN.30.29	And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.
GEN.30.30	For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the 
GEN.30.31	And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:
GEN.30.32	I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.
GEN.30.33	So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.
GEN.30.34	And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
GEN.30.35	And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
GEN.30.36	And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
GEN.30.37	And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
GEN.30.38	And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
GEN.30.39	And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
GEN.30.40	And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.
GEN.30.41	And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
GEN.30.42	But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
GEN.30.43	And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.
GEN.31.1	And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory.
GEN.31.2	And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.
GEN.31.3	And the 
GEN.31.4	And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
GEN.31.5	And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.
GEN.31.6	And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
GEN.31.7	And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
GEN.31.8	If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.
GEN.31.9	Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
GEN.31.10	And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.
GEN.31.11	And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.
GEN.31.12	And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
GEN.31.13	I am the God of Beth–el, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.
GEN.31.14	And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
GEN.31.15	Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.
GEN.31.16	For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.
GEN.31.17	Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
GEN.31.18	And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Paddan–aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.
GEN.31.19	And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.
GEN.31.20	And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
GEN.31.21	So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.
GEN.31.22	And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
GEN.31.23	And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
GEN.31.24	And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
GEN.31.25	Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.
GEN.31.26	And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?
GEN.31.27	Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
GEN.31.28	And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
GEN.31.29	It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
GEN.31.30	And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
GEN.31.31	And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
GEN.31.32	With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
GEN.31.33	And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
GEN.31.34	Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.
GEN.31.35	And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.
GEN.31.36	And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
GEN.31.37	Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.
GEN.31.38	This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
GEN.31.39	That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.
GEN.31.40	Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.
GEN.31.41	Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
GEN.31.42	Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
GEN.31.43	And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?
GEN.31.44	Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
GEN.31.45	And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
GEN.31.46	And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.
GEN.31.47	And Laban called it Jegar–sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
GEN.31.48	And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;
GEN.31.49	And Mizpah; for he said, The 
GEN.31.50	If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.
GEN.31.51	And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;
GEN.31.52	This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
GEN.31.53	The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.
GEN.31.54	Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
GEN.31.55	And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.
GEN.32.1	And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
GEN.32.2	And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
GEN.32.3	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
GEN.32.4	And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
GEN.32.5	And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
GEN.32.6	And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
GEN.32.7	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;
GEN.32.8	And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
GEN.32.9	And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the 
GEN.32.10	I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
GEN.32.11	Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.
GEN.32.12	And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
GEN.32.13	And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
GEN.32.14	Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
GEN.32.15	Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.
GEN.32.16	And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
GEN.32.17	And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?
GEN.32.18	Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.
GEN.32.19	And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.
GEN.32.20	And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.
GEN.32.21	So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
GEN.32.22	And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
GEN.32.23	And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.
GEN.32.24	And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
GEN.32.25	And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
GEN.32.26	And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
GEN.32.27	And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
GEN.32.28	And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
GEN.32.29	And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
GEN.32.30	And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
GEN.32.31	And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
GEN.32.32	Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.
GEN.33.1	And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.
GEN.33.2	And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
GEN.33.3	And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
GEN.33.4	And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
GEN.33.5	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.
GEN.33.6	Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
GEN.33.7	And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
GEN.33.8	And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.
GEN.33.9	And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.
GEN.33.10	And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
GEN.33.11	Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.
GEN.33.12	And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
GEN.33.13	And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.
GEN.33.14	Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
GEN.33.15	And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
GEN.33.16	So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
GEN.33.17	And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
GEN.33.18	And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan–aram; and pitched his tent before the city.
GEN.33.19	And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.
GEN.33.20	And he erected there an altar, and called it El–elohe–Israel.
GEN.34.1	And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
GEN.34.2	And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.
GEN.34.3	And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.
GEN.34.4	And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
GEN.34.5	And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
GEN.34.6	And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
GEN.34.7	And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
GEN.34.8	And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.
GEN.34.9	And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
GEN.34.10	And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
GEN.34.11	And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
GEN.34.12	Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
GEN.34.13	And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:
GEN.34.14	And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:
GEN.34.15	But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;
GEN.34.16	Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
GEN.34.17	But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
GEN.34.18	And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
GEN.34.19	And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.
GEN.34.20	And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
GEN.34.21	These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
GEN.34.22	Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
GEN.34.23	Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
GEN.34.24	And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
GEN.34.25	And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.
GEN.34.26	And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.
GEN.34.27	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.
GEN.34.28	They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,
GEN.34.29	And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.
GEN.34.30	And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
GEN.34.31	And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
GEN.35.1	And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth–el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
GEN.35.2	Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:
GEN.35.3	And let us arise, and go up to Beth–el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
GEN.35.4	And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
GEN.35.5	And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
GEN.35.6	So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Beth–el, he and all the people that were with him.
GEN.35.7	And he built there an altar, and called the place El–beth–el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
GEN.35.8	But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Beth–el under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon–bachuth.
GEN.35.9	And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Paddan–aram, and blessed him.
GEN.35.10	And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.
GEN.35.11	And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
GEN.35.12	And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
GEN.35.13	And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
GEN.35.14	And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.
GEN.35.15	And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth–el.
GEN.35.16	And they journeyed from Beth–el; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.
GEN.35.17	And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.
GEN.35.18	And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Ben–oni: but his father called him Benjamin.
GEN.35.19	And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Beth–lehem.
GEN.35.20	And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
GEN.35.21	And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.
GEN.35.22	And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
GEN.35.23	The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:
GEN.35.24	The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:
GEN.35.25	And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:
GEN.35.26	And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Paddan–aram.
GEN.35.27	And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
GEN.35.28	And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.
GEN.35.29	And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
GEN.36.1	Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.
GEN.36.2	Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
GEN.36.3	And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth.
GEN.36.4	And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;
GEN.36.5	And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.
GEN.36.6	And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.
GEN.36.7	For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.
GEN.36.8	Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
GEN.36.9	And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:
GEN.36.10	These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.
GEN.36.11	And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.
GEN.36.12	And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.
GEN.36.13	And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.
GEN.36.14	And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.
GEN.36.15	These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,
GEN.36.16	Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.
GEN.36.17	And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.
GEN.36.18	And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.
GEN.36.19	These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.
GEN.36.20	These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,
GEN.36.21	And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.
GEN.36.22	And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.
GEN.36.23	And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
GEN.36.24	And these are the children of Zibeon; both Aiah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.
GEN.36.25	And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.
GEN.36.26	And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.
GEN.36.27	The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.
GEN.36.28	The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.
GEN.36.29	These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,
GEN.36.30	Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.
GEN.36.31	And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.
GEN.36.32	And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
GEN.36.33	And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.
GEN.36.34	And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.
GEN.36.35	And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.
GEN.36.36	And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.
GEN.36.37	And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.
GEN.36.38	And Saul died, and Baal–hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.
GEN.36.39	And Baal–hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
GEN.36.40	And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,
GEN.36.41	Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,
GEN.36.42	Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,
GEN.36.43	Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.
GEN.37.1	And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
GEN.37.2	These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.
GEN.37.3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.
GEN.37.4	And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
GEN.37.5	And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
GEN.37.6	And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
GEN.37.7	For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
GEN.37.8	And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
GEN.37.9	And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
GEN.37.10	And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
GEN.37.11	And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
GEN.37.12	And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
GEN.37.13	And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.
GEN.37.14	And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
GEN.37.15	And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
GEN.37.16	And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.
GEN.37.17	And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
GEN.37.18	And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
GEN.37.19	And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
GEN.37.20	Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
GEN.37.21	And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.
GEN.37.22	And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.
GEN.37.23	And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;
GEN.37.24	And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
GEN.37.25	And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
GEN.37.26	And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?
GEN.37.27	Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.
GEN.37.28	Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
GEN.37.29	And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
GEN.37.30	And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?
GEN.37.31	And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;
GEN.37.32	And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.
GEN.37.33	And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
GEN.37.34	And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
GEN.37.35	And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
GEN.37.36	And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.
GEN.38.1	And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
GEN.38.2	And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shua; and he took her, and went in unto her.
GEN.38.3	And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
GEN.38.4	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
GEN.38.5	And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.
GEN.38.6	And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
GEN.38.7	And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the 
GEN.38.8	And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
GEN.38.9	And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.
GEN.38.10	And the thing which he did displeased the 
GEN.38.11	Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
GEN.38.12	And in process of time the daughter of Shua Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
GEN.38.13	And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.
GEN.38.14	And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.
GEN.38.15	When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.
GEN.38.16	And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
GEN.38.17	And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?
GEN.38.18	And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
GEN.38.19	And she arose, and went away, and laid by her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
GEN.38.20	And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.
GEN.38.21	Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.
GEN.38.22	And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.
GEN.38.23	And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
GEN.38.24	And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
GEN.38.25	When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
GEN.38.26	And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
GEN.38.27	And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.
GEN.38.28	And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
GEN.38.29	And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.
GEN.38.30	And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerah.
GEN.39.1	And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, which had brought him down thither.
GEN.39.2	And the 
GEN.39.3	And his master saw that the 
GEN.39.4	And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
GEN.39.5	And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the 
GEN.39.6	And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.
GEN.39.7	And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
GEN.39.8	But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;
GEN.39.9	There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
GEN.39.10	And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.
GEN.39.11	And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.
GEN.39.12	And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
GEN.39.13	And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
GEN.39.14	That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
GEN.39.15	And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.
GEN.39.16	And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
GEN.39.17	And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:
GEN.39.18	And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.
GEN.39.19	And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
GEN.39.20	And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.
GEN.39.21	But the 
GEN.39.22	And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.
GEN.39.23	The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the 
GEN.40.1	And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
GEN.40.2	And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
GEN.40.3	And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
GEN.40.4	And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.
GEN.40.5	And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.
GEN.40.6	And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.
GEN.40.7	And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?
GEN.40.8	And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.
GEN.40.9	And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
GEN.40.10	And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
GEN.40.11	And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
GEN.40.12	And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:
GEN.40.13	Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
GEN.40.14	But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
GEN.40.15	For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
GEN.40.16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:
GEN.40.17	And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
GEN.40.18	And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:
GEN.40.19	Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
GEN.40.20	And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
GEN.40.21	And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
GEN.40.22	But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
GEN.40.23	Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
GEN.41.1	And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
GEN.41.2	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
GEN.41.3	And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.
GEN.41.4	And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
GEN.41.5	And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
GEN.41.6	And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
GEN.41.7	And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
GEN.41.8	And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
GEN.41.9	Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
GEN.41.10	Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:
GEN.41.11	And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
GEN.41.12	And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
GEN.41.13	And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
GEN.41.14	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
GEN.41.15	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
GEN.41.16	And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
GEN.41.17	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
GEN.41.18	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
GEN.41.19	And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
GEN.41.20	And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
GEN.41.21	And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
GEN.41.22	And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
GEN.41.23	And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
GEN.41.24	And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
GEN.41.25	And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.
GEN.41.26	The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
GEN.41.27	And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
GEN.41.28	This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
GEN.41.29	Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
GEN.41.30	And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
GEN.41.31	And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.
GEN.41.32	And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
GEN.41.33	Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
GEN.41.35	And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
GEN.41.36	And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
GEN.41.37	And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
GEN.41.38	And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?
GEN.41.39	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:
GEN.41.40	Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
GEN.41.41	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.42	And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
GEN.41.43	And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.44	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.45	And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath–paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti–phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.46	And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.47	And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
GEN.41.48	And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
GEN.41.49	And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.
GEN.41.50	And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti–phera priest of On bare unto him.
GEN.41.51	And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
GEN.41.52	And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
GEN.41.53	And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
GEN.41.54	And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
GEN.41.55	And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
GEN.41.56	And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.57	And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.
GEN.42.1	Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
GEN.42.2	And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
GEN.42.3	And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
GEN.42.4	But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.
GEN.42.5	And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
GEN.42.6	And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.
GEN.42.7	And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
GEN.42.8	And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
GEN.42.9	And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
GEN.42.10	And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
GEN.42.11	We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.
GEN.42.12	And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
GEN.42.13	And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
GEN.42.14	And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:
GEN.42.15	Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
GEN.42.16	Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
GEN.42.17	And he put them all together into ward three days.
GEN.42.18	And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:
GEN.42.19	If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:
GEN.42.20	But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
GEN.42.21	And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
GEN.42.22	And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
GEN.42.23	And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
GEN.42.24	And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
GEN.42.25	Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.
GEN.42.26	And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
GEN.42.27	And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.
GEN.42.28	And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?
GEN.42.29	And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,
GEN.42.30	The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
GEN.42.31	And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:
GEN.42.32	We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
GEN.42.33	And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:
GEN.42.34	And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.
GEN.42.35	And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
GEN.42.36	And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.
GEN.42.37	And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
GEN.42.38	And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
GEN.43.1	And the famine was sore in the land.
GEN.43.2	And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
GEN.43.3	And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
GEN.43.4	If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
GEN.43.5	But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
GEN.43.6	And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
GEN.43.7	And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
GEN.43.8	And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.
GEN.43.9	I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
GEN.43.10	For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.
GEN.43.11	And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
GEN.43.12	And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:
GEN.43.13	Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
GEN.43.14	And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
GEN.43.15	And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
GEN.43.16	And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.
GEN.43.17	And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
GEN.43.18	And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
GEN.43.19	And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
GEN.43.20	And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
GEN.43.21	And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
GEN.43.22	And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
GEN.43.23	And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
GEN.43.24	And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
GEN.43.25	And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
GEN.43.26	And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
GEN.43.27	And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?
GEN.43.28	And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.
GEN.43.29	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
GEN.43.30	And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.
GEN.43.31	And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
GEN.43.32	And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
GEN.43.33	And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.
GEN.43.34	And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.
GEN.44.1	And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
GEN.44.2	And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
GEN.44.3	As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
GEN.44.4	And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
GEN.44.5	Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
GEN.44.6	And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.
GEN.44.7	And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:
GEN.44.8	Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?
GEN.44.9	With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.
GEN.44.10	And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.
GEN.44.11	Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
GEN.44.12	And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
GEN.44.13	Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
GEN.44.14	And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
GEN.44.15	And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
GEN.44.16	And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.
GEN.44.17	And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.
GEN.44.18	Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.
GEN.44.19	My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
GEN.44.20	And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.
GEN.44.21	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.
GEN.44.22	And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
GEN.44.23	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
GEN.44.24	And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
GEN.44.25	And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.
GEN.44.26	And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.
GEN.44.27	And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:
GEN.44.28	And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:
GEN.44.29	And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
GEN.44.30	Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;
GEN.44.31	It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
GEN.44.32	For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.
GEN.44.33	Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
GEN.44.34	For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.
GEN.45.1	Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
GEN.45.2	And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
GEN.45.3	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
GEN.45.4	And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
GEN.45.5	Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
GEN.45.6	For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.
GEN.45.7	And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
GEN.45.8	So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
GEN.45.9	Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:
GEN.45.10	And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:
GEN.45.11	And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.
GEN.45.12	And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.
GEN.45.13	And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.
GEN.45.14	And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
GEN.45.15	Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
GEN.45.16	And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
GEN.45.17	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
GEN.45.18	And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
GEN.45.19	Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
GEN.45.20	Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
GEN.45.21	And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
GEN.45.22	To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
GEN.45.23	And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.
GEN.45.24	So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.
GEN.45.25	And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,
GEN.45.26	And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.
GEN.45.27	And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
GEN.45.28	And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.
GEN.46.1	And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer–sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
GEN.46.2	And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.
GEN.46.3	And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:
GEN.46.4	I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
GEN.46.5	And Jacob rose up from Beer–sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
GEN.46.6	And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
GEN.46.7	His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
GEN.46.8	And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.
GEN.46.9	And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
GEN.46.10	And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.
GEN.46.11	And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
GEN.46.12	And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.
GEN.46.13	And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.
GEN.46.14	And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
GEN.46.15	These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Paddan–aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.
GEN.46.16	And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
GEN.46.17	And the sons of Asher; Imnah, and Ishuah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.
GEN.46.18	These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.
GEN.46.19	The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.
GEN.46.20	And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti–phera priest of On bare unto him.
GEN.46.21	And the sons of Benjamin were Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
GEN.46.22	These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.
GEN.46.23	And the sons of Dan; Hushim.
GEN.46.24	And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
GEN.46.25	These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.
GEN.46.26	All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;
GEN.46.27	And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.
GEN.46.28	And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
GEN.46.29	And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
GEN.46.30	And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.
GEN.46.31	And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
GEN.46.32	And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
GEN.46.33	And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?
GEN.46.34	That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
GEN.47.1	Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
GEN.47.2	And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.
GEN.47.3	And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.
GEN.47.4	They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
GEN.47.5	And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:
GEN.47.6	The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
GEN.47.7	And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
GEN.47.8	And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?
GEN.47.9	And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
GEN.47.10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
GEN.47.11	And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
GEN.47.12	And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.
GEN.47.13	And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
GEN.47.14	And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
GEN.47.15	And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.
GEN.47.16	And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.
GEN.47.17	And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.
GEN.47.18	When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:
GEN.47.19	Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.
GEN.47.20	And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.
GEN.47.21	And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
GEN.47.22	Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.
GEN.47.23	Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
GEN.47.24	And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
GEN.47.25	And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
GEN.47.26	And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.
GEN.47.27	And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
GEN.47.28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.
GEN.47.29	And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:
GEN.47.30	But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
GEN.47.31	And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.
GEN.48.1	And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
GEN.48.2	And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
GEN.48.3	And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
GEN.48.4	And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
GEN.48.5	And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
GEN.48.6	And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
GEN.48.7	And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Beth–lehem.
GEN.48.8	And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?
GEN.48.9	And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
GEN.48.10	Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
GEN.48.11	And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.
GEN.48.12	And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
GEN.48.13	And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.
GEN.48.14	And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
GEN.48.15	And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,
GEN.48.16	The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
GEN.48.17	And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.
GEN.48.18	And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.
GEN.48.19	And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
GEN.48.20	And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
GEN.48.21	And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
GEN.48.22	Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
GEN.49.1	And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.
GEN.49.2	Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.
GEN.49.3	Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:
GEN.49.4	Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.
GEN.49.5	Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.
GEN.49.6	O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.
GEN.49.7	Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
GEN.49.8	Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
GEN.49.9	Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?
GEN.49.10	The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.
GEN.49.11	Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:
GEN.49.12	His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
GEN.49.13	Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.
GEN.49.14	Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
GEN.49.15	And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.
GEN.49.16	Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
GEN.49.17	Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.
GEN.49.18	I have waited for thy salvation, O 
GEN.49.19	Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.
GEN.49.20	Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.
GEN.49.21	Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
GEN.49.22	Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:
GEN.49.23	The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:
GEN.49.24	But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)
GEN.49.25	Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:
GEN.49.26	The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
GEN.49.27	Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.
GEN.49.28	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
GEN.49.29	And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
GEN.49.30	In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.
GEN.49.31	There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
GEN.49.32	The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.
GEN.49.33	And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
GEN.50.1	And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
GEN.50.2	And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
GEN.50.3	And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
GEN.50.4	And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
GEN.50.5	My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
GEN.50.6	And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
GEN.50.7	And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
GEN.50.8	And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
GEN.50.9	And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
GEN.50.10	And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
GEN.50.11	And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel–mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.
GEN.50.12	And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
GEN.50.13	For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
GEN.50.14	And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
GEN.50.15	And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
GEN.50.16	And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
GEN.50.17	So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
GEN.50.18	And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.
GEN.50.19	And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
GEN.50.20	But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
GEN.50.21	Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.
GEN.50.22	And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
GEN.50.23	And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
GEN.50.24	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
GEN.50.25	And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
EXO.1.1	Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
EXO.1.4	Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
EXO.1.5	And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.
EXO.1.6	And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
EXO.1.7	And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
EXO.1.8	Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.
EXO.1.9	And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:
EXO.1.10	Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.
EXO.1.11	Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Rameses.
EXO.1.12	But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
EXO.1.13	And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:
EXO.1.14	And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.
EXO.1.15	And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:
EXO.1.16	And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.
EXO.1.17	But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.
EXO.1.18	And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?
EXO.1.19	And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.
EXO.1.20	Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
EXO.1.21	And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
EXO.1.22	And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
EXO.2.1	And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.
EXO.2.2	And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
EXO.2.3	And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.
EXO.2.4	And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
EXO.2.5	And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
EXO.2.6	And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.
EXO.2.7	Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
EXO.2.8	And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.
EXO.2.9	And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
EXO.2.10	And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.
EXO.2.11	And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
EXO.2.12	And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
EXO.2.13	And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
EXO.2.14	And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.
EXO.2.15	Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
EXO.2.16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
EXO.2.17	And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
EXO.2.18	And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?
EXO.2.19	And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.
EXO.2.20	And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
EXO.2.21	And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
EXO.2.22	And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
EXO.2.23	And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
EXO.2.24	And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
EXO.2.25	And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.
EXO.3.1	Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.
EXO.3.2	And the angel of the 
EXO.3.3	And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
EXO.3.4	And when the 
EXO.3.5	And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
EXO.3.6	Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
EXO.3.7	And the 
EXO.3.8	And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
EXO.3.9	Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
EXO.3.10	Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
EXO.3.11	And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
EXO.3.12	And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
EXO.3.13	And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?
EXO.3.14	And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.
EXO.3.15	And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The 
EXO.3.16	Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The 
EXO.3.17	And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
EXO.3.18	And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The 
EXO.3.19	And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.
EXO.3.20	And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.
EXO.3.21	And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:
EXO.3.22	But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.
EXO.4.1	And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The 
EXO.4.2	And the 
EXO.4.3	And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.
EXO.4.4	And the 
EXO.4.5	That they may believe that the 
EXO.4.6	And the 
EXO.4.7	And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.
EXO.4.8	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
EXO.4.9	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.
EXO.4.10	And Moses said unto the 
EXO.4.11	And the 
EXO.4.12	Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.
EXO.4.13	And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.
EXO.4.14	And the anger of the 
EXO.4.15	And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.
EXO.4.16	And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.
EXO.4.17	And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.
EXO.4.18	And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
EXO.4.19	And the 
EXO.4.20	And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
EXO.4.21	And the 
EXO.4.22	And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the 
EXO.4.23	And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.
EXO.4.24	And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the 
EXO.4.25	Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.
EXO.4.26	So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.
EXO.4.27	And the 
EXO.4.28	And Moses told Aaron all the words of the 
EXO.4.29	And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:
EXO.4.30	And Aaron spake all the words which the 
EXO.4.31	And the people believed: and when they heard that the 
EXO.5.1	And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the 
EXO.5.2	And Pharaoh said, Who is the 
EXO.5.3	And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the 
EXO.5.4	And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.
EXO.5.5	And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
EXO.5.6	And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
EXO.5.7	Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
EXO.5.8	And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
EXO.5.9	Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.
EXO.5.10	And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
EXO.5.11	Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.
EXO.5.12	So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.
EXO.5.13	And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.
EXO.5.14	And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?
EXO.5.15	Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?
EXO.5.16	There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.
EXO.5.17	But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the 
EXO.5.18	Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.
EXO.5.19	And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.
EXO.5.20	And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:
EXO.5.21	And they said unto them, The 
EXO.5.22	And Moses returned unto the 
EXO.5.23	For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
EXO.6.1	Then the 
EXO.6.2	And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the 
EXO.6.3	And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name 
EXO.6.4	And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.
EXO.6.5	And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.
EXO.6.6	Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the 
EXO.6.7	And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the 
EXO.6.8	And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the 
EXO.6.9	And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
EXO.6.10	And the 
EXO.6.11	Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
EXO.6.12	And Moses spake before the 
EXO.6.13	And the 
EXO.6.14	These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.
EXO.6.15	And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.
EXO.6.16	And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.
EXO.6.17	The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimei, according to their families.
EXO.6.18	And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years.
EXO.6.19	And the sons of Merari; Mahli and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations.
EXO.6.20	And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.
EXO.6.21	And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.
EXO.6.22	And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.
EXO.6.23	And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Nahshon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
EXO.6.24	And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites.
EXO.6.25	And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.
EXO.6.26	These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the 
EXO.6.27	These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.
EXO.6.28	And it came to pass on the day when the 
EXO.6.29	That the 
EXO.6.30	And Moses said before the 
EXO.7.1	And the 
EXO.7.2	Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.
EXO.7.3	And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
EXO.7.4	But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
EXO.7.5	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the 
EXO.7.6	And Moses and Aaron did as the 
EXO.7.7	And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.
EXO.7.8	And the 
EXO.7.9	When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.
EXO.7.10	And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the 
EXO.7.11	Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.
EXO.7.12	For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
EXO.7.13	And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the 
EXO.7.14	And the 
EXO.7.15	Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.
EXO.7.16	And thou shalt say unto him, The 
EXO.7.17	Thus saith the 
EXO.7.18	And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.
EXO.7.19	And the 
EXO.7.20	And Moses and Aaron did so, as the 
EXO.7.21	And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
EXO.7.22	And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the 
EXO.7.23	And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.
EXO.7.24	And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
EXO.7.25	And seven days were fulfilled, after that the 
EXO.8.1	And the 
EXO.8.2	And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:
EXO.8.3	And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:
EXO.8.4	And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.
EXO.8.5	And the 
EXO.8.6	And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.7	And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.8	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the 
EXO.8.9	And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?
EXO.8.10	And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the 
EXO.8.11	And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.
EXO.8.12	And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the 
EXO.8.13	And the 
EXO.8.14	And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.
EXO.8.15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the 
EXO.8.16	And the 
EXO.8.17	And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.18	And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.
EXO.8.19	Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the 
EXO.8.20	And the 
EXO.8.21	Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.
EXO.8.22	And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the 
EXO.8.23	And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.
EXO.8.24	And the 
EXO.8.25	And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.
EXO.8.26	And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the 
EXO.8.27	We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.28	And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.29	And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the 
EXO.8.30	And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the 
EXO.8.31	And the 
EXO.8.32	And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.
EXO.9.1	Then the 
EXO.9.2	For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,
EXO.9.3	Behold, the hand of the 
EXO.9.4	And the 
EXO.9.5	And the 
EXO.9.6	And the 
EXO.9.7	And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
EXO.9.8	And the 
EXO.9.9	And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
EXO.9.10	And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.
EXO.9.11	And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
EXO.9.12	And the 
EXO.9.13	And the 
EXO.9.14	For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.
EXO.9.15	For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
EXO.9.16	And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
EXO.9.17	As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?
EXO.9.18	Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.
EXO.9.19	Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
EXO.9.20	He that feared the word of the 
EXO.9.21	And he that regarded not the word of the 
EXO.9.22	And the 
EXO.9.23	And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the 
EXO.9.24	So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
EXO.9.25	And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.
EXO.9.26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.
EXO.9.27	And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the 
EXO.9.28	Entreat the 
EXO.9.29	And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the 
EXO.9.30	But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the 
EXO.9.31	And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.
EXO.9.32	But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.
EXO.9.33	And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the 
EXO.9.34	And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
EXO.9.35	And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the 
EXO.10.1	And the 
EXO.10.2	And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the 
EXO.10.3	And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
EXO.10.4	Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:
EXO.10.5	And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:
EXO.10.6	And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.
EXO.10.7	And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the 
EXO.10.8	And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the 
EXO.10.9	And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the 
EXO.10.10	And he said unto them, Let the 
EXO.10.11	Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the 
EXO.10.12	And the 
EXO.10.13	And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the 
EXO.10.14	And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
EXO.10.15	For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
EXO.10.16	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the 
EXO.10.17	Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the 
EXO.10.18	And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the 
EXO.10.19	And the 
EXO.10.20	But the 
EXO.10.21	And the 
EXO.10.22	And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:
EXO.10.23	They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
EXO.10.24	And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the 
EXO.10.25	And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the 
EXO.10.26	Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the 
EXO.10.27	But the 
EXO.10.28	And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.
EXO.10.29	And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.
EXO.11.1	And the 
EXO.11.2	Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.
EXO.11.3	And the 
EXO.11.4	And Moses said, Thus saith the 
EXO.11.5	And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.
EXO.11.6	And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.
EXO.11.7	But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the 
EXO.11.8	And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.
EXO.11.9	And the 
EXO.11.10	And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the 
EXO.12.1	And the 
EXO.12.2	This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.
EXO.12.3	Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:
EXO.12.4	And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.
EXO.12.5	Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:
EXO.12.6	And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
EXO.12.7	And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.
EXO.12.8	And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
EXO.12.9	Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.
EXO.12.10	And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
EXO.12.11	And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the 
EXO.12.12	For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the 
EXO.12.13	And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.
EXO.12.14	And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the 
EXO.12.15	Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
EXO.12.16	And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.
EXO.12.17	And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.
EXO.12.18	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.
EXO.12.19	Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.
EXO.12.20	Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.
EXO.12.21	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.
EXO.12.22	And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.
EXO.12.23	For the 
EXO.12.24	And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
EXO.12.25	And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the 
EXO.12.26	And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?
EXO.12.27	That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the 
EXO.12.28	And the children of Israel went away, and did as the 
EXO.12.29	And it came to pass, that at midnight the 
EXO.12.30	And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
EXO.12.31	And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the 
EXO.12.32	Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.
EXO.12.33	And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.
EXO.12.34	And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
EXO.12.35	And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:
EXO.12.36	And the 
EXO.12.37	And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.
EXO.12.38	And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.
EXO.12.39	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.
EXO.12.40	Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.
EXO.12.41	And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the 
EXO.12.42	It is a night to be much observed unto the 
EXO.12.43	And the 
EXO.12.44	But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.
EXO.12.45	A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.
EXO.12.46	In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.
EXO.12.47	All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
EXO.12.48	And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the 
EXO.12.49	One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.
EXO.12.50	Thus did all the children of Israel; as the 
EXO.12.51	And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the 
EXO.13.1	And the 
EXO.13.2	Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.
EXO.13.3	And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the 
EXO.13.4	This day came ye out in the month Abib.
EXO.13.5	And it shall be when the 
EXO.13.6	Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the 
EXO.13.7	Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.
EXO.13.8	And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the 
EXO.13.9	And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the 
EXO.13.10	Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.
EXO.13.11	And it shall be when the 
EXO.13.12	That thou shalt set apart unto the 
EXO.13.13	And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.
EXO.13.14	And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the 
EXO.13.15	And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the 
EXO.13.16	And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the 
EXO.13.17	And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:
EXO.13.18	But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.
EXO.13.19	And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.
EXO.13.20	And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
EXO.13.21	And the 
EXO.13.22	He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.
EXO.14.1	And the 
EXO.14.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi–hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal–zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.
EXO.14.3	For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.
EXO.14.4	And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the 
EXO.14.5	And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
EXO.14.6	And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:
EXO.14.7	And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.
EXO.14.8	And the 
EXO.14.9	But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi–hahiroth, before Baal–zephon.
EXO.14.10	And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the 
EXO.14.11	And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?
EXO.14.12	Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
EXO.14.13	And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the 
EXO.14.14	The 
EXO.14.15	And the 
EXO.14.16	But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.
EXO.14.17	And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
EXO.14.18	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the 
EXO.14.19	And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:
EXO.14.20	And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.
EXO.14.21	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the 
EXO.14.22	And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
EXO.14.23	And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
EXO.14.24	And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the 
EXO.14.25	And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the 
EXO.14.26	And the 
EXO.14.27	And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the 
EXO.14.28	And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.
EXO.14.29	But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
EXO.14.30	Thus the 
EXO.14.31	And Israel saw that great work which the 
EXO.15.1	Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the 
EXO.15.2	The 
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.4	Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.
EXO.15.5	The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.
EXO.15.6	Thy right hand, O 
EXO.15.7	And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.
EXO.15.8	And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.
EXO.15.9	The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
EXO.15.10	Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.
EXO.15.11	Who is like unto thee, O 
EXO.15.12	Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.
EXO.15.13	Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.
EXO.15.14	The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.
EXO.15.15	Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.
EXO.15.16	Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O 
EXO.15.17	Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O 
EXO.15.18	The 
EXO.15.19	For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the 
EXO.15.20	And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
EXO.15.21	And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the 
EXO.15.22	So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
EXO.15.23	And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.
EXO.15.24	And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
EXO.15.25	And he cried unto the 
EXO.15.26	And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the 
EXO.15.27	And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
EXO.16.1	And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
EXO.16.2	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:
EXO.16.3	And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the 
EXO.16.4	Then said the 
EXO.16.5	And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
EXO.16.6	And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the 
EXO.16.7	And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the 
EXO.16.8	And Moses said, This shall be, when the 
EXO.16.9	And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the 
EXO.16.10	And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the 
EXO.16.11	And the 
EXO.16.12	I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the 
EXO.16.13	And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.
EXO.16.14	And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.
EXO.16.15	And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the 
EXO.16.16	This is the thing which the 
EXO.16.17	And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.
EXO.16.18	And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.
EXO.16.19	And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
EXO.16.20	Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.
EXO.16.21	And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
EXO.16.22	And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
EXO.16.23	And he said unto them, This is that which the 
EXO.16.24	And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.
EXO.16.25	And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the 
EXO.16.26	Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
EXO.16.27	And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.
EXO.16.28	And the 
EXO.16.29	See, for that the 
EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
EXO.16.31	And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
EXO.16.32	And Moses said, This is the thing which the 
EXO.16.33	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the 
EXO.16.34	As the 
EXO.16.35	And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.
EXO.16.36	Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
EXO.17.1	And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the 
EXO.17.2	Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the 
EXO.17.3	And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?
EXO.17.4	And Moses cried unto the 
EXO.17.5	And the 
EXO.17.6	Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
EXO.17.7	And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the 
EXO.17.8	Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
EXO.17.9	And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.
EXO.17.10	So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
EXO.17.11	And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
EXO.17.12	But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
EXO.17.13	And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
EXO.17.14	And the 
EXO.17.15	And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah–nissi:
EXO.17.16	For he said, Because the 
EXO.18.1	When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the 
EXO.18.2	Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,
EXO.18.3	And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:
EXO.18.4	And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:
EXO.18.5	And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:
EXO.18.6	And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
EXO.18.7	And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.
EXO.18.8	And Moses told his father in law all that the 
EXO.18.9	And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the 
EXO.18.10	And Jethro said, Blessed be the 
EXO.18.11	Now I know that the 
EXO.18.12	And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.
EXO.18.13	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.
EXO.18.14	And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?
EXO.18.15	And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:
EXO.18.16	When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
EXO.18.17	And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.
EXO.18.18	Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
EXO.18.19	Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:
EXO.18.20	And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
EXO.18.21	Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
EXO.18.22	And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.
EXO.18.23	If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.
EXO.18.24	So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.
EXO.18.25	And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
EXO.18.26	And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
EXO.18.27	And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
EXO.19.1	In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.
EXO.19.2	For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.
EXO.19.3	And Moses went up unto God, and the 
EXO.19.4	Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.
EXO.19.5	Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:
EXO.19.6	And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.
EXO.19.7	And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the 
EXO.19.8	And all the people answered together, and said, All that the 
EXO.19.9	And the 
EXO.19.10	And the 
EXO.19.11	And be ready against the third day: for the third day the 
EXO.19.12	And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:
EXO.19.13	There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.
EXO.19.14	And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.
EXO.19.15	And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.
EXO.19.16	And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.
EXO.19.17	And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
EXO.19.18	And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the 
EXO.19.19	And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.
EXO.19.20	And the 
EXO.19.21	And the 
EXO.19.22	And let the priests also, which come near to the 
EXO.19.23	And Moses said unto the 
EXO.19.24	And the 
EXO.19.25	So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.
EXO.20.1	And God spake all these words, saying,
EXO.20.2	I am the 
EXO.20.3	Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
EXO.20.4	Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
EXO.20.5	Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the 
EXO.20.6	And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
EXO.20.7	Thou shalt not take the name of the 
EXO.20.8	Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
EXO.20.9	Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:
EXO.20.10	But the seventh day is the sabbath of the 
EXO.20.11	For in six days the 
EXO.20.12	Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the 
EXO.20.13	Thou shalt not kill.
EXO.20.14	Thou shalt not commit adultery.
EXO.20.15	Thou shalt not steal.
EXO.20.16	Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
EXO.20.17	Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.
EXO.20.18	And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.
EXO.20.19	And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
EXO.20.20	And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.
EXO.20.21	And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
EXO.20.22	And the 
EXO.20.23	Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.
EXO.20.24	An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.
EXO.20.25	And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
EXO.20.26	Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.
EXO.21.1	Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
EXO.21.2	If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
EXO.21.3	If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.
EXO.21.4	If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.
EXO.21.5	And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:
EXO.21.6	Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.
EXO.21.7	And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.
EXO.21.8	If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
EXO.21.9	And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
EXO.21.10	If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.
EXO.21.11	And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.
EXO.21.12	He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.
EXO.21.13	And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.
EXO.21.14	But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.
EXO.21.15	And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.
EXO.21.16	And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
EXO.21.17	And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.
EXO.21.18	And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:
EXO.21.19	If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
EXO.21.20	And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.
EXO.21.21	Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.
EXO.21.22	If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.
EXO.21.23	And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,
EXO.21.24	Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
EXO.21.25	Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
EXO.21.26	And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.
EXO.21.27	And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.
EXO.21.28	If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.
EXO.21.29	But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.
EXO.21.30	If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.
EXO.21.31	Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.
EXO.21.32	If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
EXO.21.33	And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;
EXO.21.34	The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.
EXO.21.35	And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide.
EXO.21.36	Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.
EXO.22.1	If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
EXO.22.2	If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.
EXO.22.3	If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
EXO.22.4	If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.
EXO.22.5	If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.
EXO.22.6	If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
EXO.22.7	If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.
EXO.22.8	If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods.
EXO.22.9	For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.
EXO.22.10	If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:
EXO.22.11	Then shall an oath of the 
EXO.22.12	And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.
EXO.22.13	If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.
EXO.22.14	And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good.
EXO.22.15	But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.
EXO.22.16	And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.
EXO.22.17	If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
EXO.22.18	Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
EXO.22.19	Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.
EXO.22.20	He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the 
EXO.22.21	Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
EXO.22.22	Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.
EXO.22.23	If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;
EXO.22.24	And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
EXO.22.25	If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.
EXO.22.26	If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:
EXO.22.27	For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.
EXO.22.28	Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.
EXO.22.29	Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.
EXO.22.30	Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.
EXO.22.31	And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.
EXO.23.1	Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
EXO.23.2	Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:
EXO.23.3	Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.
EXO.23.4	If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.
EXO.23.5	If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.
EXO.23.6	Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.
EXO.23.7	Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
EXO.23.8	And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.
EXO.23.9	Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
EXO.23.10	And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:
EXO.23.11	But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.
EXO.23.12	Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.
EXO.23.13	And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.
EXO.23.14	Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.
EXO.23.15	Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)
EXO.23.16	And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.
EXO.23.17	Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord 
EXO.23.18	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.
EXO.23.19	The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the 
EXO.23.20	Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
EXO.23.21	Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.
EXO.23.22	But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
EXO.23.23	For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.
EXO.23.24	Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.
EXO.23.25	And ye shall serve the 
EXO.23.26	There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.

EXO.29.41	And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the 
EXO.29.42	This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the 
EXO.29.43	And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.
EXO.29.44	And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.
EXO.29.45	And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.
EXO.29.46	And they shall know that I am the 
EXO.30.1	And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt thou make it.
EXO.30.2	A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.
EXO.30.3	And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.
EXO.30.4	And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.
EXO.30.5	And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.
EXO.30.6	And thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.
EXO.30.7	And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.
EXO.30.8	And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the 
EXO.30.9	Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.
EXO.30.10	And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the 
EXO.30.11	And the 
EXO.30.12	When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the 
EXO.30.13	This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the 
EXO.30.14	Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the 
EXO.30.15	The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the 
EXO.30.16	And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the 
EXO.30.17	And the 
EXO.30.18	Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.
EXO.30.19	For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:
EXO.30.20	When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the 
EXO.30.21	So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.
EXO.30.22	Moreover the 
EXO.30.23	Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,
EXO.30.24	And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:
EXO.30.25	And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.
EXO.30.26	And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,
EXO.30.27	And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,
EXO.30.28	And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.
EXO.30.29	And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.
EXO.30.30	And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.
EXO.30.31	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.
EXO.30.32	Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.
EXO.30.33	Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.
EXO.30.34	And the 
EXO.30.35	And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:
EXO.30.36	And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.
EXO.30.37	And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the 
EXO.30.38	Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.
EXO.31.1	And the 
EXO.31.2	See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:
EXO.31.3	And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
EXO.31.4	To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
EXO.31.5	And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.
EXO.31.6	And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;
EXO.31.7	The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,
EXO.31.8	And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,
EXO.31.9	And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,
EXO.31.10	And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,
EXO.31.11	And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.
EXO.31.12	And the 
EXO.31.13	Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the 
EXO.31.14	Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
EXO.31.15	Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the 
EXO.31.16	Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.
EXO.31.17	It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the 
EXO.31.18	And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
EXO.32.1	And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
EXO.32.2	And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.
EXO.32.3	And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.
EXO.32.4	And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
EXO.32.5	And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the 
EXO.32.6	And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
EXO.32.7	And the 
EXO.32.8	They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
EXO.32.9	And the 
EXO.32.10	Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.
EXO.32.11	And Moses besought the 
EXO.32.12	Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.
EXO.32.13	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.
EXO.32.14	And the 
EXO.32.15	And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
EXO.32.16	And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
EXO.32.17	And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.
EXO.32.18	And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.
EXO.32.19	And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.
EXO.32.20	And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
EXO.32.21	And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?
EXO.32.22	And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.
EXO.32.23	For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
EXO.32.24	And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
EXO.32.25	And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)
EXO.32.26	Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the 
EXO.32.27	And he said unto them, Thus saith the 
EXO.32.28	And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
EXO.32.29	For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the 
EXO.32.30	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the 
EXO.32.31	And Moses returned unto the 
EXO.32.32	Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin―; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.
EXO.32.33	And the 
EXO.32.34	Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.
EXO.32.35	And the 
EXO.33.1	And the 
EXO.33.2	And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
EXO.33.3	Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.
EXO.33.4	And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.
EXO.33.5	For the 
EXO.33.6	And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.
EXO.33.7	And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the 
EXO.33.8	And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.
EXO.33.9	And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the 
EXO.33.10	And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.
EXO.33.11	And the 
EXO.33.12	And Moses said unto the 
EXO.33.13	Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.
EXO.33.14	And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.
EXO.33.15	And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.
EXO.33.16	For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.
EXO.33.17	And the 
EXO.33.18	And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.
EXO.33.19	And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the 
EXO.33.20	And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.
EXO.33.21	And the 
EXO.33.22	And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:
EXO.33.23	And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.
EXO.34.1	And the 
EXO.34.2	And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.
EXO.34.3	And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
EXO.34.4	And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the 
EXO.34.5	And the 
EXO.34.6	And the 
EXO.34.7	Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.
EXO.34.8	And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.
EXO.34.9	And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.
EXO.34.10	And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the 
EXO.34.11	Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
EXO.34.12	Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
EXO.34.13	But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:
EXO.34.14	For thou shalt worship no other god: for the 
EXO.34.15	Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;
EXO.34.16	And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.
EXO.34.17	Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
EXO.34.18	The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.
EXO.34.19	All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.
EXO.34.20	But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
EXO.34.21	Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
EXO.34.22	And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.
EXO.34.23	Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord 
EXO.34.24	For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the 
EXO.34.25	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.
EXO.34.26	The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the 
EXO.34.27	And the 
EXO.34.28	And he was there with the 
EXO.34.29	And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.
EXO.34.30	And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.
EXO.34.31	And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.
EXO.34.32	And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the 
EXO.34.33	And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.
EXO.34.34	But when Moses went in before the 
EXO.34.35	And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
EXO.35.1	And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the 
EXO.35.2	Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the 
EXO.35.3	Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.
EXO.35.4	And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the 
EXO.35.5	Take ye from among you an offering unto the 
EXO.35.6	And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,
EXO.35.7	And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,
EXO.35.8	And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,
EXO.35.9	And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.
EXO.35.10	And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the 
EXO.35.11	The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,
EXO.35.12	The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the veil of the covering,
EXO.35.13	The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread,
EXO.35.14	The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,
EXO.35.15	And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle,
EXO.35.16	The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,
EXO.35.17	The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,
EXO.35.18	The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,
EXO.35.19	The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.
EXO.35.20	And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
EXO.35.21	And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the 
EXO.35.22	And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the 
EXO.35.23	And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.
EXO.35.24	Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the 
EXO.35.25	And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.
EXO.35.26	And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair.
EXO.35.27	And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;
EXO.35.28	And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.
EXO.35.29	The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the 
EXO.35.30	And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the 
EXO.35.31	And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;
EXO.35.32	And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
EXO.35.33	And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.
EXO.35.34	And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
EXO.35.35	Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.
EXO.36.1	Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the 
EXO.36.2	And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the 
EXO.36.3	And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.
EXO.36.4	And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;
EXO.36.5	And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the 
EXO.36.6	And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.
EXO.36.7	For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
EXO.36.8	And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.
EXO.36.9	The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.
EXO.36.10	And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.
EXO.36.11	And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.
EXO.36.12	Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another.
EXO.36.13	And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.
EXO.36.14	And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.
EXO.36.15	The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.
EXO.36.16	And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.
EXO.36.17	And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.
EXO.36.18	And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.
EXO.36.19	And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that.
EXO.36.20	And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.
EXO.36.21	The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.
EXO.36.22	One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.
EXO.36.23	And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:
EXO.36.24	And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.
EXO.36.25	And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards,
EXO.36.26	And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.
EXO.36.27	And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.
EXO.36.28	And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.
EXO.36.29	And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.
EXO.36.30	And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.
EXO.36.31	And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
EXO.36.32	And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.

EXO.39.20	And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.
EXO.39.21	And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the 
EXO.39.22	And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.
EXO.39.23	And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.
EXO.39.24	And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.
EXO.39.25	And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;
EXO.39.26	A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the 
EXO.39.27	And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,
EXO.39.28	And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,
EXO.39.29	And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the 
EXO.39.30	And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE 
EXO.39.31	And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the 
EXO.39.32	Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the

EXO.39.42	According to all that the 
EXO.39.43	And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the 
EXO.40.1	And the 
EXO.40.2	On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
EXO.40.3	And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the veil.
EXO.40.4	And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.
EXO.40.5	And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.
EXO.40.6	And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
EXO.40.7	And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.
EXO.40.8	And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.
EXO.40.9	And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.
EXO.40.10	And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.
EXO.40.11	And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.
EXO.40.12	And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

EXO.40.14	And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:
EXO.40.15	And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
EXO.40.16	Thus did Moses: according to all that the 
EXO.40.17	And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.
EXO.40.18	And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.
EXO.40.19	And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the 
EXO.40.20	And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:
EXO.40.21	And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the 
EXO.40.22	And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil.
EXO.40.23	And he set the bread in order upon it before the 
EXO.40.24	And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
EXO.40.25	And he lighted the lamps before the 
EXO.40.26	And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the veil:
EXO.40.27	And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the 
EXO.40.28	And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.
EXO.40.29	And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the 
EXO.40.30	And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.
EXO.40.31	And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:
EXO.40.32	When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the 
EXO.40.33	And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.
EXO.40.34	Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the 
EXO.40.35	And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the 
EXO.40.36	And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:
EXO.40.37	But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
EXO.40.38	For the cloud of the 
LEV.1.1	And the 
LEV.1.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the 
LEV.1.3	If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the 
LEV.1.4	And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
LEV.1.5	And he shall kill the bullock before the 
LEV.1.6	And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.
LEV.1.7	And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:
LEV.1.8	And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:
LEV.1.9	But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
LEV.1.10	And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.
LEV.1.11	And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the 
LEV.1.12	And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:
LEV.1.13	But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
LEV.1.14	And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the 
LEV.1.15	And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:
LEV.1.16	And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:
LEV.1.17	And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
LEV.2.1	And when any will offer a grain offering unto the 
LEV.2.2	And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
LEV.2.3	And the remnant of the grain offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the 
LEV.2.4	And if thou bring an oblation of a grain offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
LEV.2.5	And if thy oblation be a grain offering baken in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.
LEV.2.6	Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a grain offering.
LEV.2.7	And if thy oblation be a grain offering baken in the fryingpan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
LEV.2.8	And thou shalt bring the grain offering that is made of these things unto the 
LEV.2.9	And the priest shall take from the grain offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
LEV.2.10	And that which is left of the grain offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the 
LEV.2.11	No grain offering, which ye shall bring unto the 
LEV.2.12	As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the 
LEV.2.13	And every oblation of thy grain offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy grain offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.
LEV.2.14	And if thou offer a grain offering of thy firstfruits unto the 
LEV.2.15	And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a grain offering.
LEV.2.16	And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.3.1	And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the 
LEV.3.2	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
LEV.3.3	And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.3.4	And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.

LEV.3.8	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.
LEV.3.9	And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.3.10	And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.
LEV.3.11	And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.3.12	And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the 
LEV.3.13	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.
LEV.3.14	And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.3.15	And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.

LEV.3.17	It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.
LEV.4.1	And the 
LEV.4.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the 
LEV.4.3	If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the 
LEV.4.4	And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the 
LEV.4.5	And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:
LEV.4.6	And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the 
LEV.4.7	And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the 
LEV.4.8	And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
LEV.4.9	And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,
LEV.4.10	As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.
LEV.4.11	And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,
LEV.4.12	Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.
LEV.4.13	And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the 
LEV.4.14	When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.
LEV.4.15	And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the 
LEV.4.16	And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:
LEV.4.17	And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the 
LEV.4.18	And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the 
LEV.4.19	And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar.
LEV.4.20	And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.
LEV.4.21	And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation.
LEV.4.22	When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the 
LEV.4.23	Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:
LEV.4.24	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the 
LEV.4.25	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.
LEV.4.26	And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.
LEV.4.27	And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the 
LEV.4.28	Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.
LEV.4.29	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.
LEV.4.30	And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.
LEV.4.31	And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the 
LEV.4.32	And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.
LEV.4.33	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.
LEV.4.34	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:
LEV.4.35	And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the 
LEV.5.1	And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.
LEV.5.2	Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.
LEV.5.3	Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.
LEV.5.4	Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these.
LEV.5.5	And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing:
LEV.5.6	And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the 
LEV.5.7	And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the 
LEV.5.8	And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder:
LEV.5.9	And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.
LEV.5.10	And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
LEV.5.11	But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.
LEV.5.12	Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the 
LEV.5.13	And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.
LEV.5.14	And the 
LEV.5.15	If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the 
LEV.5.16	And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.
LEV.5.17	And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the 
LEV.5.18	And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.
LEV.5.19	It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the 
LEV.6.1	And the 
LEV.6.2	If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the 
LEV.6.3	Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:
LEV.6.4	Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,
LEV.6.5	Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass offering.
LEV.6.6	And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the 
LEV.6.7	And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the 
LEV.6.8	And the 
LEV.6.9	Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.
LEV.6.10	And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
LEV.6.11	And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.
LEV.6.12	And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.
LEV.6.13	The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.
LEV.6.14	And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the 
LEV.6.15	And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the 
LEV.6.16	And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.
LEV.6.17	It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.
LEV.6.18	All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the 
LEV.6.19	And the 
LEV.6.20	This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the 
LEV.6.21	In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the 
LEV.6.22	And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the 
LEV.6.23	For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.
LEV.6.24	And the 
LEV.6.25	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the 
LEV.6.26	The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.
LEV.6.27	Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.
LEV.6.28	But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water.
LEV.6.29	All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.
LEV.6.30	And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.
LEV.7.1	Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.
LEV.7.2	In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.
LEV.7.3	And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,
LEV.7.4	And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:
LEV.7.5	And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.7.6	Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.
LEV.7.7	As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it.
LEV.7.8	And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.
LEV.7.9	And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it.
LEV.7.10	And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.
LEV.7.11	And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the 
LEV.7.12	If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.
LEV.7.13	Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.
LEV.7.14	And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the 
LEV.7.15	And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
LEV.7.16	But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:
LEV.7.17	But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
LEV.7.18	And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.
LEV.7.19	And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.
LEV.7.20	But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the 
LEV.7.21	Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the 
LEV.7.22	And the 
LEV.7.23	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.
LEV.7.24	And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
LEV.7.25	For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.7.26	Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
LEV.7.27	Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
LEV.7.28	And the 
LEV.7.29	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the 
LEV.7.30	His own hands shall bring the offerings of the 
LEV.7.31	And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.
LEV.7.32	And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
LEV.7.33	He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.
LEV.7.34	For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.
LEV.7.35	This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the 
LEV.7.36	Which the 
LEV.7.37	This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;
LEV.7.38	Which the 
LEV.8.1	And the 
LEV.8.2	Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;
LEV.8.3	And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
LEV.8.4	And Moses did as the 
LEV.8.5	And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the 
LEV.8.6	And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
LEV.8.7	And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.
LEV.8.8	And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.
LEV.8.9	And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the 
LEV.8.10	And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.
LEV.8.11	And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.
LEV.8.12	And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
LEV.8.13	And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the 
LEV.8.14	And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.
LEV.8.15	And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.
LEV.8.16	And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar.
LEV.8.17	But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the 
LEV.8.18	And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
LEV.8.19	And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
LEV.8.20	And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
LEV.8.21	And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.8.22	And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
LEV.8.23	And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
LEV.8.24	And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
LEV.8.25	And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:
LEV.8.26	And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the 
LEV.8.27	And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the 
LEV.8.28	And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.8.29	And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the 
LEV.8.30	And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
LEV.8.31	And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
LEV.8.32	And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
LEV.8.33	And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.
LEV.8.34	As he hath done this day, so the 
LEV.8.35	Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the 
LEV.8.36	So Aaron and his sons did all things which the 
LEV.9.1	And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
LEV.9.2	And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the 
LEV.9.3	And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;
LEV.9.4	Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the 
LEV.9.5	And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the 
LEV.9.6	And Moses said, This is the thing which the 
LEV.9.7	And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the 
LEV.9.8	Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
LEV.9.9	And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:
LEV.9.10	But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the 
LEV.9.11	And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
LEV.9.12	And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.
LEV.9.13	And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.
LEV.9.14	And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.
LEV.9.15	And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
LEV.9.16	And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.
LEV.9.17	And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.
LEV.9.18	He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,
LEV.9.19	And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:
LEV.9.20	And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:
LEV.9.21	And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the 
LEV.9.22	And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.
LEV.9.23	And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the 
LEV.9.24	And there came a fire out from before the 
LEV.10.1	And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the 
LEV.10.2	And there went out fire from the 
LEV.10.3	Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the 
LEV.10.4	And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
LEV.10.5	So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.
LEV.10.6	And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the 
LEV.10.7	And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the 
LEV.10.8	And the 
LEV.10.9	Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:
LEV.10.10	And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;
LEV.10.11	And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the 
LEV.10.12	And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the 
LEV.10.13	And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the 
LEV.10.14	And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.
LEV.10.15	The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the 
LEV.10.16	And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,
LEV.10.17	Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the 
LEV.10.18	Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.
LEV.10.19	And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the 
LEV.10.20	And when Moses heard that, he was content.
LEV.11.1	And the 
LEV.11.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.
LEV.11.3	Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.
LEV.11.4	Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
LEV.11.5	And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
LEV.11.6	And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
LEV.11.7	And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.
LEV.11.8	Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.
LEV.11.9	These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.
LEV.11.10	And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:
LEV.11.11	They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.
LEV.11.12	Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.
LEV.11.13	And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,
LEV.11.14	And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;
LEV.11.15	Every raven after his kind;
LEV.11.16	And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,
LEV.11.17	And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
LEV.11.18	And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,
LEV.11.19	And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
LEV.11.20	All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you.
LEV.11.21	Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;
LEV.11.22	Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.
LEV.11.23	But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you.
LEV.11.24	And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.
LEV.11.25	And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
LEV.11.26	The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.
LEV.11.27	And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.
LEV.11.28	And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.
LEV.11.29	These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,
LEV.11.30	And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.
LEV.11.31	These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.
LEV.11.32	And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.
LEV.11.33	And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.
LEV.11.34	Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.
LEV.11.35	And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.
LEV.11.36	Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.
LEV.11.37	And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean.
LEV.11.38	But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.
LEV.11.39	And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.
LEV.11.40	And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
LEV.11.41	And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
LEV.11.42	Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.
LEV.11.43	Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.
LEV.11.44	For I am the 
LEV.11.45	For I am the 
LEV.11.46	This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:
LEV.11.47	To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.
LEV.12.1	And the 
LEV.12.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.
LEV.12.3	And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
LEV.12.4	And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.
LEV.12.5	But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.
LEV.12.6	And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:
LEV.12.7	Who shall offer it before the 
LEV.12.8	And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
LEV.13.1	And the 
LEV.13.2	When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:
LEV.13.3	And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.
LEV.13.4	If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:
LEV.13.5	And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:
LEV.13.6	And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
LEV.13.7	But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:
LEV.13.8	And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.
LEV.13.9	When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;
LEV.13.10	And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising;
LEV.13.11	It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.
LEV.13.12	And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;
LEV.13.13	Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.
LEV.13.14	But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
LEV.13.15	And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.
LEV.13.16	Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;
LEV.13.17	And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.
LEV.13.18	The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,
LEV.13.19	And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;
LEV.13.20	And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.
LEV.13.21	But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
LEV.13.22	And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.
LEV.13.23	But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
LEV.13.24	Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;
LEV.13.25	Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
LEV.13.26	But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
LEV.13.27	And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
LEV.13.28	And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning.
LEV.13.29	If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;
LEV.13.30	Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.
LEV.13.31	And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:
LEV.13.32	And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin;
LEV.13.33	He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:
LEV.13.34	And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
LEV.13.35	But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;
LEV.13.36	Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean.
LEV.13.37	But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
LEV.13.38	If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;
LEV.13.39	Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.
LEV.13.40	And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean.
LEV.13.41	And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.
LEV.13.42	And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.
LEV.13.43	Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;
LEV.13.44	He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.
LEV.13.45	And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
LEV.13.46	All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be.
LEV.13.47	The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;
LEV.13.48	Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;
LEV.13.49	And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:
LEV.13.50	And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath the plague seven days:
LEV.13.51	And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.
LEV.13.52	He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.
LEV.13.53	And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;
LEV.13.54	Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:
LEV.13.55	And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.
LEV.13.56	And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:
LEV.13.57	And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.
LEV.13.58	And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.
LEV.13.59	This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
LEV.14.1	And the 
LEV.14.2	This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:
LEV.14.3	And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;
LEV.14.4	Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
LEV.14.5	And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:
LEV.14.6	As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:
LEV.14.7	And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.
LEV.14.8	And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.
LEV.14.9	But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.
LEV.14.10	And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.
LEV.14.11	And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the 
LEV.14.12	And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the 
LEV.14.13	And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy:
LEV.14.14	And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:
LEV.14.15	And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand:
LEV.14.16	And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the 
LEV.14.17	And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering:
LEV.14.18	And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the 
LEV.14.19	And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:
LEV.14.20	And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
LEV.14.21	And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;
LEV.14.22	And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering.
LEV.14.23	And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the 
LEV.14.24	And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the 
LEV.14.25	And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:
LEV.14.26	And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand:
LEV.14.27	And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the 
LEV.14.28	And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering:
LEV.14.29	And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the 
LEV.14.30	And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get;
LEV.14.31	Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the 
LEV.14.32	This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.
LEV.14.33	And the 
LEV.14.34	When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
LEV.14.35	And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house:
LEV.14.36	Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:
LEV.14.37	And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;
LEV.14.38	Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:
LEV.14.39	And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;
LEV.14.40	Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:
LEV.14.41	And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:
LEV.14.42	And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
LEV.14.43	And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plastered;
LEV.14.44	Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.
LEV.14.45	And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.
LEV.14.46	Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.
LEV.14.47	And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.
LEV.14.48	And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
LEV.14.49	And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
LEV.14.50	And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
LEV.14.51	And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:
LEV.14.52	And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:
LEV.14.53	But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.
LEV.14.54	This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,
LEV.14.55	And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,
LEV.14.56	And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:
LEV.14.57	To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.
LEV.15.1	And the 
LEV.15.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.
LEV.15.3	And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness.
LEV.15.4	Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.

LEV.15.14	And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and come before the 
LEV.15.15	And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the 
LEV.15.16	And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.
LEV.15.17	And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.
LEV.15.18	The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.

LEV.15.25	And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.
LEV.15.26	Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.

LEV.15.32	This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;
LEV.15.33	And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.
LEV.16.1	And the 
LEV.16.2	And the 
LEV.16.3	Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.
LEV.16.4	He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.

LEV.16.13	And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the 
LEV.16.14	And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
LEV.16.15	Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:
LEV.16.16	And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
LEV.16.17	And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.
LEV.16.18	And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the 
LEV.16.19	And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
LEV.16.20	And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:
LEV.16.21	And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:
LEV.16.22	And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.
LEV.16.23	And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:
LEV.16.24	And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.
LEV.16.25	And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.
LEV.16.26	And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.
LEV.16.27	And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.
LEV.16.28	And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
LEV.16.29	And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:
LEV.16.30	For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the 
LEV.16.31	It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.
LEV.16.32	And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments:
LEV.16.33	And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.
LEV.16.34	And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the 
LEV.17.1	And the 
LEV.17.2	Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the 
LEV.17.3	What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,
LEV.17.4	And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the 
LEV.17.5	To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the 
LEV.17.6	And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the 
LEV.17.7	And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.
LEV.17.8	And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,
LEV.17.9	And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the 
LEV.17.10	And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
LEV.17.11	For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.
LEV.17.12	Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
LEV.17.13	And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.
LEV.17.14	For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.
LEV.17.15	And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.
LEV.17.16	But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.
LEV.18.1	And the 
LEV.18.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the 
LEV.18.3	After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.
LEV.18.4	Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the 
LEV.18.5	Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the 
LEV.18.6	None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the 
LEV.18.7	The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
LEV.18.8	The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness.
LEV.18.9	The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
LEV.18.10	The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.
LEV.18.11	The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
LEV.18.12	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman.
LEV.18.13	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.
LEV.18.14	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.
LEV.18.15	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
LEV.18.16	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness.
LEV.18.17	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.
LEV.18.18	Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.
LEV.18.19	Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.
LEV.18.20	Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.
LEV.18.21	And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the 
LEV.18.22	Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.
LEV.18.23	Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.
LEV.18.24	Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:
LEV.18.25	And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.
LEV.18.26	Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:
LEV.18.27	(For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)
LEV.18.28	That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.
LEV.18.29	For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.
LEV.18.30	Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the 
LEV.19.1	And the 
LEV.19.2	Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the 
LEV.19.3	Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the 
LEV.19.4	Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the 
LEV.19.5	And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the 
LEV.19.6	It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.
LEV.19.7	And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.
LEV.19.8	Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the 
LEV.19.9	And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.
LEV.19.10	And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the 
LEV.19.11	Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.
LEV.19.12	And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the 
LEV.19.13	Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.
LEV.19.14	Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the 
LEV.19.15	Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.
LEV.19.16	Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the 
LEV.19.17	Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.
LEV.19.18	Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the 
LEV.19.19	Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.
LEV.19.20	And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
LEV.19.21	And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the 
LEV.19.22	And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the 
LEV.19.23	And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.
LEV.19.24	But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the 
LEV.19.25	And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the 
LEV.19.26	Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.
LEV.19.27	Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
LEV.19.28	Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the 
LEV.19.29	Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.
LEV.19.30	Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the 
LEV.19.31	Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the 
LEV.19.32	Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the 
LEV.19.33	And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.
LEV.19.34	But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the 
LEV.19.35	Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.
LEV.19.36	Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the 
LEV.19.37	Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the 
LEV.20.1	And the 
LEV.20.2	Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
LEV.20.3	And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
LEV.20.4	And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:
LEV.20.5	Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.
LEV.20.6	And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.
LEV.20.7	Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the 
LEV.20.8	And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the 
LEV.20.9	For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.
LEV.20.10	And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
LEV.20.11	And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
LEV.20.12	And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.
LEV.20.13	If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
LEV.20.14	And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.
LEV.20.15	And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.
LEV.20.16	And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
LEV.20.17	And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
LEV.20.18	And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
LEV.20.19	And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.
LEV.20.20	And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.
LEV.20.21	And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.
LEV.20.22	Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.
LEV.20.23	And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
LEV.20.24	But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the 
LEV.20.25	Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.
LEV.20.26	And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the 
LEV.20.27	A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.
LEV.21.1	And the 
LEV.21.2	But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,
LEV.21.3	And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.
LEV.21.4	But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
LEV.21.5	They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
LEV.21.6	They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the 
LEV.21.7	They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.
LEV.21.8	Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the 
LEV.21.9	And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.
LEV.21.10	And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;
LEV.21.11	Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;
LEV.21.12	Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the 
LEV.21.13	And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
LEV.21.14	A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.
LEV.21.15	Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the 
LEV.21.16	And the 
LEV.21.17	Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.
LEV.21.18	For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,
LEV.21.19	Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,
LEV.21.20	Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;
LEV.21.21	No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the 
LEV.21.22	He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.
LEV.21.23	Only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the 
LEV.21.24	And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.
LEV.22.1	And the 
LEV.22.2	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the 
LEV.22.3	Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the 
LEV.22.4	What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;
LEV.22.5	Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;
LEV.22.6	The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.
LEV.22.7	And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.
LEV.22.8	That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the 
LEV.22.9	They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the 
LEV.22.10	There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.
LEV.22.11	But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.
LEV.22.12	If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.
LEV.22.13	But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.
LEV.22.14	And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing.
LEV.22.15	And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the 
LEV.22.16	Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the 
LEV.22.17	And the 
LEV.22.18	Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the 
LEV.22.19	Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.
LEV.22.20	But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
LEV.22.21	And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the 
LEV.22.22	Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the 
LEV.22.23	Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
LEV.22.24	Ye shall not offer unto the 
LEV.22.25	Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
LEV.22.26	And the 
LEV.22.27	When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.22.28	And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
LEV.22.29	And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the 
LEV.22.30	On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the 
LEV.22.31	Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the 
LEV.22.32	Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the 
LEV.22.33	That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the 
LEV.23.1	And the 
LEV.23.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the 
LEV.23.3	Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the 
LEV.23.4	These are the feasts of the 
LEV.23.5	In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the 
LEV.23.6	And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the 
LEV.23.7	In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
LEV.23.8	But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.23.9	And the 
LEV.23.10	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:
LEV.23.11	And he shall wave the sheaf before the 
LEV.23.12	And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the 
LEV.23.13	And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.23.14	And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
LEV.23.15	And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:
LEV.23.16	Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the 
LEV.23.17	Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the 
LEV.23.18	And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the 
LEV.23.19	Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
LEV.23.20	And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the 
LEV.23.21	And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
LEV.23.22	And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the 
LEV.23.23	And the 
LEV.23.24	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.
LEV.23.25	Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.23.26	And the 
LEV.23.27	Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.23.28	And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the 
LEV.23.29	For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.
LEV.23.30	And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.
LEV.23.31	Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
LEV.23.32	It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.
LEV.23.33	And the 
LEV.23.34	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the 
LEV.23.35	On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
LEV.23.36	Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.23.37	These are the feasts of the 
LEV.23.38	Beside the sabbaths of the 
LEV.23.39	Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the 
LEV.23.40	And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the 
LEV.23.41	And ye shall keep it a feast unto the 
LEV.23.42	Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:
LEV.23.43	That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the 
LEV.23.44	And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the 
LEV.24.1	And the 
LEV.24.2	Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.
LEV.24.3	Without the veil of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the 
LEV.24.4	He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the 
LEV.24.5	And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.
LEV.24.6	And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the 
LEV.24.7	And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.24.8	Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the 
LEV.24.9	And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the 
LEV.24.10	And the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
LEV.24.11	And the Israelite woman's son blasphemed the name of the 
LEV.24.12	And they put him in ward, that the mind of the 
LEV.24.13	And the 
LEV.24.14	Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
LEV.24.15	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
LEV.24.16	And he that blasphemeth the name of the 
LEV.24.17	And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
LEV.24.18	And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.
LEV.24.19	And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;
LEV.24.20	Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.
LEV.24.21	And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.
LEV.24.22	Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the 
LEV.24.23	And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the 
LEV.25.1	And the 
LEV.25.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the 
LEV.25.3	Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;
LEV.25.4	But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the 
LEV.25.5	That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.
LEV.25.6	And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,
LEV.25.7	And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.
LEV.25.8	And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.
LEV.25.9	Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
LEV.25.10	And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
LEV.25.11	A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.
LEV.25.12	For it is the jubilee; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
LEV.25.13	In the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession.
LEV.25.14	And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:
LEV.25.15	According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:
LEV.25.16	According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.
LEV.25.17	Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am the 
LEV.25.18	Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
LEV.25.19	And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
LEV.25.20	And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:
LEV.25.21	Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
LEV.25.22	And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.
LEV.25.23	The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
LEV.25.24	And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
LEV.25.25	If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.
LEV.25.26	And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;
LEV.25.27	Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.
LEV.25.28	But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
LEV.25.29	And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.
LEV.25.30	And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee.
LEV.25.31	But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.
LEV.25.32	Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
LEV.25.33	And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubilee: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
LEV.25.34	But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
LEV.25.35	And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.
LEV.25.36	Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
LEV.25.37	Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
LEV.25.38	I am the 
LEV.25.39	And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:
LEV.25.40	But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee:
LEV.25.41	And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
LEV.25.42	For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.
LEV.25.43	Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.
LEV.25.44	Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
LEV.25.45	Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.
LEV.25.46	And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.
LEV.25.47	And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:
LEV.25.48	After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:
LEV.25.49	Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.
LEV.25.50	And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.
LEV.25.51	If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
LEV.25.52	And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
LEV.25.53	And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.
LEV.25.54	And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, both he, and his children with him.
LEV.25.55	For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the 
LEV.26.1	Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the 
LEV.26.2	Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the 
LEV.26.3	If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
LEV.26.4	Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
LEV.26.5	And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
LEV.26.6	And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
LEV.26.7	And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
LEV.26.8	And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
LEV.26.9	For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.
LEV.26.10	And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.
LEV.26.11	And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
LEV.26.12	And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
LEV.26.13	I am the 
LEV.26.14	But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;
LEV.26.15	And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant:
LEV.26.16	I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
LEV.26.17	And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
LEV.26.18	And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
LEV.26.19	And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:
LEV.26.20	And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
LEV.26.21	And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
LEV.26.22	I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.
LEV.26.23	And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;
LEV.26.24	Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
LEV.26.25	And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
LEV.26.26	And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
LEV.26.27	And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
LEV.26.28	Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
LEV.26.29	And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
LEV.26.30	And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
LEV.26.31	And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.
LEV.26.32	And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
LEV.26.33	And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.
LEV.26.34	Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.
LEV.26.35	As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
LEV.26.36	And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
LEV.26.37	And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
LEV.26.38	And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
LEV.26.39	And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
LEV.26.40	If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;
LEV.26.41	And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
LEV.26.42	Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
LEV.26.43	The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
LEV.26.44	And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the 
LEV.26.45	But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the 
LEV.26.46	These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the 
LEV.27.1	And the 
LEV.27.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the 
LEV.27.3	And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
LEV.27.4	And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
LEV.27.5	And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
LEV.27.6	And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
LEV.27.7	And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
LEV.27.8	But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
LEV.27.9	And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the 
LEV.27.10	He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
LEV.27.11	And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the 
LEV.27.12	And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.
LEV.27.13	But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.
LEV.27.14	And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the 
LEV.27.15	And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
LEV.27.16	And if a man shall sanctify unto the 
LEV.27.17	If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
LEV.27.18	But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
LEV.27.19	And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
LEV.27.20	And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
LEV.27.21	But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the 
LEV.27.22	And if a man sanctify unto the 
LEV.27.23	Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubilee: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the 
LEV.27.24	In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.
LEV.27.25	And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
LEV.27.26	Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the 
LEV.27.27	And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
LEV.27.28	Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the 
LEV.27.29	None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.
LEV.27.30	And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the 
LEV.27.31	And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.
LEV.27.32	And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the 
LEV.27.33	He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
LEV.27.34	These are the commandments, which the 
NUM.1.1	And the 
NUM.1.2	Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls;

NUM.5.3	Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.
NUM.5.4	And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the 
NUM.5.5	And the 
NUM.5.6	Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the 
NUM.5.7	Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed.
NUM.5.8	But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the 
NUM.5.9	And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.
NUM.5.10	And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.
NUM.5.11	And the 
NUM.5.12	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,
NUM.5.13	And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;
NUM.5.14	And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:
NUM.5.15	Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
NUM.5.16	And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the 
NUM.5.17	And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water:
NUM.5.18	And the priest shall set the woman before the 
NUM.5.19	And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:
NUM.5.20	But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband:
NUM.5.21	Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The 
NUM.5.22	And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.
NUM.5.23	And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:
NUM.5.24	And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.
NUM.5.25	Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the 
NUM.5.26	And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.
NUM.5.27	And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
NUM.5.28	And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
NUM.5.29	This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;
NUM.5.30	Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the 
NUM.5.31	Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.
NUM.6.1	And the 
NUM.6.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the 
NUM.6.3	He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.
NUM.6.4	All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.
NUM.6.5	All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the 
NUM.6.6	All the days that he separateth himself unto the 
NUM.6.7	He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is upon his head.
NUM.6.8	All the days of his separation he is holy unto the 
NUM.6.9	And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.
NUM.6.10	And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
NUM.6.11	And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.
NUM.6.12	And he shall consecrate unto the 
NUM.6.13	And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
NUM.6.14	And he shall offer his offering unto the 
NUM.6.15	And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.
NUM.6.16	And the priest shall bring them before the 
NUM.6.17	And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the 
NUM.6.18	And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.
NUM.6.19	And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven:
NUM.6.20	And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the 
NUM.6.21	This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering unto the 
NUM.6.22	And the 
NUM.6.23	Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,
NUM.6.24	The 
NUM.6.25	The 
NUM.6.26	The 
NUM.6.27	And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.
NUM.7.1	And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;
NUM.7.2	That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered:
NUM.7.3	And they brought their offering before the

NUM.8.1	And the 
NUM.8.2	Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.
NUM.8.3	And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the 
NUM.8.4	And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according unto the pattern which the 
NUM.8.5	And the 
NUM.8.6	Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.
NUM.8.7	And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.
NUM.8.8	Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering.
NUM.8.9	And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together:
NUM.8.10	And thou shalt bring the Levites before the 
NUM.8.11	And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the 
NUM.8.12	And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, unto the 
NUM.8.13	And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering unto the 
NUM.8.14	Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.
NUM.8.15	And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for an offering.
NUM.8.16	For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.
NUM.8.17	For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.
NUM.8.18	And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel.
NUM.8.19	And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.
NUM.8.20	And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the 
NUM.8.21	And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the 
NUM.8.22	And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the 
NUM.8.23	And the 
NUM.8.24	This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:
NUM.8.25	And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more:
NUM.8.26	But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.
NUM.9.1	And the 
NUM.9.2	Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.
NUM.9.3	In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.
NUM.9.4	And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.
NUM.9.5	And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the 
NUM.9.6	And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:
NUM.9.7	And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the 
NUM.9.8	And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the 
NUM.9.9	And the 
NUM.9.10	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the 
NUM.9.11	The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
NUM.9.12	They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.
NUM.9.13	But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the 
NUM.9.14	And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the 
NUM.9.15	And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.
NUM.9.16	So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.
NUM.9.17	And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.
NUM.9.18	At the commandment of the 
NUM.9.19	And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the 
NUM.9.20	And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the 
NUM.9.21	And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
NUM.9.22	Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
NUM.9.23	At the commandment of the 
NUM.10.1	And the 
NUM.10.2	Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.
NUM.10.3	And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
NUM.10.4	And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.
NUM.10.5	When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.
NUM.10.6	When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
NUM.10.7	But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
NUM.10.8	And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.
NUM.10.9	And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the 
NUM.10.10	Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the 
NUM.10.11	And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.10.12	And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.
NUM.10.13	And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the 
NUM.10.14	In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

NUM.10.27	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
NUM.10.28	Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward.
NUM.10.29	And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the 
NUM.10.30	And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.
NUM.10.31	And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.
NUM.10.32	And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the 
NUM.10.33	And they departed from the mount of the 
NUM.10.34	And the cloud of the 
NUM.10.35	And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, 
NUM.10.36	And when it rested, he said, Return, O 
NUM.11.1	And when the people complained, it displeased the 
NUM.11.2	And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the 
NUM.11.3	And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the 
NUM.11.4	And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
NUM.11.5	We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:
NUM.11.6	But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.
NUM.11.7	And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.
NUM.11.8	And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
NUM.11.9	And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.
NUM.11.10	Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the 
NUM.11.11	And Moses said unto the 
NUM.11.12	Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?
NUM.11.13	Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
NUM.11.14	I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
NUM.11.15	And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
NUM.11.16	And the 
NUM.11.17	And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.
NUM.11.18	And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the 
NUM.11.19	Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;
NUM.11.20	But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the 
NUM.11.21	And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
NUM.11.22	Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?
NUM.11.23	And the 
NUM.11.24	And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the 
NUM.11.25	And the 
NUM.11.26	But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.
NUM.11.27	And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
NUM.11.28	And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.
NUM.11.29	And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the 
NUM.11.30	And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
NUM.11.31	And there went forth a wind from the 
NUM.11.32	And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
NUM.11.33	And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the 
NUM.11.34	And he called the name of that place Kibroth–hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.
NUM.11.35	And the people journeyed from Kibroth–hattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.
NUM.12.1	And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.
NUM.12.2	And they said, Hath the 
NUM.12.3	(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.)
NUM.12.4	And the 
NUM.12.5	And the 
NUM.12.6	And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the 
NUM.12.7	My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.
NUM.12.8	With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the 
NUM.12.9	And the anger of the 
NUM.12.10	And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.
NUM.12.11	And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.
NUM.12.12	Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb.
NUM.12.13	And Moses cried unto the 
NUM.12.14	And the 
NUM.12.15	And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.
NUM.12.16	And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.
NUM.13.1	And the 
NUM.13.2	Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.

NUM.13.16	These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.
NUM.13.17	And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:
NUM.13.18	And see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;
NUM.13.19	And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;
NUM.13.20	And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes.
NUM.13.21	So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
NUM.13.22	And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
NUM.13.23	And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
NUM.13.24	The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.
NUM.13.25	And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
NUM.13.26	And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.
NUM.13.27	And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
NUM.13.28	Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
NUM.13.29	The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.
NUM.13.30	And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
NUM.13.31	But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
NUM.13.32	And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.
NUM.13.33	And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
NUM.14.1	And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
NUM.14.2	And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!
NUM.14.3	And wherefore hath the 
NUM.14.4	And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
NUM.14.6	And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:
NUM.14.7	And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.
NUM.14.8	If the 
NUM.14.9	Only rebel not ye against the 
NUM.14.10	But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the 
NUM.14.11	And the 
NUM.14.12	I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.
NUM.14.13	And Moses said unto the 
NUM.14.14	And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou 
NUM.14.15	Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,
NUM.14.16	Because the 
NUM.14.17	And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
NUM.14.18	The 
NUM.14.19	Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
NUM.14.20	And the 
NUM.14.21	But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the 
NUM.14.22	Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;
NUM.14.23	Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:
NUM.14.24	But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.
NUM.14.25	(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
NUM.14.26	And the 
NUM.14.27	How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
NUM.14.28	Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the 
NUM.14.29	Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,
NUM.14.30	Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
NUM.14.31	But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.
NUM.14.32	But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.
NUM.14.33	And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.
NUM.14.34	After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.
NUM.14.35	I the 
NUM.14.36	And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,
NUM.14.37	Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the 
NUM.14.38	But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.
NUM.14.39	And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
NUM.14.40	And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the 
NUM.14.41	And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the 
NUM.14.42	Go not up, for the 
NUM.14.43	For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the 
NUM.14.44	But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the 
NUM.14.45	Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.
NUM.15.1	And the 
NUM.15.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,
NUM.15.3	And will make an offering by fire unto the 
NUM.15.4	Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the 
NUM.15.5	And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.
NUM.15.6	Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.
NUM.15.7	And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the 
NUM.15.8	And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the 
NUM.15.9	Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.
NUM.15.10	And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
NUM.15.11	Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.
NUM.15.12	According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.
NUM.15.13	All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
NUM.15.14	And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
NUM.15.15	One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the 
NUM.15.16	One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.
NUM.15.17	And the 
NUM.15.18	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,
NUM.15.19	Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the 
NUM.15.20	Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.
NUM.15.21	Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the 
NUM.15.22	And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the 
NUM.15.23	Even all that the 
NUM.15.24	Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the 
NUM.15.25	And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the 
NUM.15.26	And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.
NUM.15.27	And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.
NUM.15.28	And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the 
NUM.15.29	Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.
NUM.15.30	But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the 
NUM.15.31	Because he hath despised the word of the 
NUM.15.32	And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.
NUM.15.33	And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.
NUM.15.34	And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.
NUM.15.35	And the 
NUM.15.36	And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the 
NUM.15.37	And the 
NUM.15.38	Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:
NUM.15.39	And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the 
NUM.15.40	That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.
NUM.15.41	I am the 
NUM.16.1	Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:
NUM.16.2	And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:
NUM.16.3	And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the 
NUM.16.4	And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:
NUM.16.5	And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the 
NUM.16.6	This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
NUM.16.7	And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the 
NUM.16.8	And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:
NUM.16.9	Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the 
NUM.16.10	And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?
NUM.16.11	For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the 
NUM.16.12	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:
NUM.16.13	Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?
NUM.16.14	Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
NUM.16.15	And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the 
NUM.16.16	And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the 
NUM.16.17	And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the 
NUM.16.18	And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.
NUM.16.19	And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the 
NUM.16.20	And the 
NUM.16.21	Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
NUM.16.22	And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?
NUM.16.23	And the 
NUM.16.24	Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
NUM.16.25	And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
NUM.16.26	And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.
NUM.16.27	So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.
NUM.16.28	And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the 
NUM.16.29	If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the 
NUM.16.30	But if the 
NUM.16.31	And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:
NUM.16.32	And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.
NUM.16.33	They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.
NUM.16.34	And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.
NUM.16.35	And there came out a fire from the 
NUM.16.36	And the 
NUM.16.37	Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.
NUM.16.38	The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the 
NUM.16.39	And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:
NUM.16.40	To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the 
NUM.16.41	But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the 
NUM.16.42	And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the 
NUM.16.43	And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
NUM.16.44	And the 
NUM.16.45	Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
NUM.16.46	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the 
NUM.16.47	And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
NUM.16.48	And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
NUM.16.49	Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.
NUM.16.50	And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.
NUM.17.1	And the 
NUM.17.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.
NUM.17.3	And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.
NUM.17.4	And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.
NUM.17.5	And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.
NUM.17.6	And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
NUM.17.7	And Moses laid up the rods before the 
NUM.17.8	And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.
NUM.17.9	And Moses brought out all the rods from before the 
NUM.17.10	And the 
NUM.17.11	And Moses did so: as the 
NUM.17.12	And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.
NUM.17.13	Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the 
NUM.18.1	And the 
NUM.18.2	And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.
NUM.18.3	And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.
NUM.18.4	And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.
NUM.18.5	And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.
NUM.18.6	And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the 
NUM.18.7	Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for every thing of the altar, and within the veil; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
NUM.18.8	And the 
NUM.18.9	This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.
NUM.18.10	In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee.
NUM.18.11	And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
NUM.18.12	All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the 
NUM.18.13	And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the 
NUM.18.14	Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.
NUM.18.15	Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the 
NUM.18.16	And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
NUM.18.17	But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the 
NUM.18.18	And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine.
NUM.18.19	All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the 
NUM.18.20	And the 
NUM.18.21	And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
NUM.18.22	Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.
NUM.18.23	But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.
NUM.18.24	But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the 
NUM.18.25	And the 
NUM.18.26	Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the 
NUM.18.27	And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress.
NUM.18.28	Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the 
NUM.18.29	Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the 
NUM.18.30	Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.
NUM.18.31	And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.
NUM.18.32	And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.
NUM.19.1	And the 
NUM.19.2	This is the ordinance of the law which the 
NUM.19.3	And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:
NUM.19.4	And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:
NUM.19.5	And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:
NUM.19.6	And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
NUM.19.7	Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.
NUM.19.8	And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.
NUM.19.9	And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.
NUM.19.10	And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.
NUM.19.11	He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.
NUM.19.12	He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
NUM.19.13	Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the 
NUM.19.14	This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
NUM.19.15	And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.
NUM.19.16	And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
NUM.19.17	And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:
NUM.19.18	And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:
NUM.19.19	And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.
NUM.19.20	But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the 
NUM.19.21	And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.
NUM.19.22	And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.
NUM.20.1	Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.
NUM.20.2	And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
NUM.20.3	And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the 
NUM.20.4	And why have ye brought up the congregation of the 
NUM.20.5	And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.
NUM.20.6	And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the 
NUM.20.7	And the 
NUM.20.8	Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.
NUM.20.9	And Moses took the rod from before the 
NUM.20.10	And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?
NUM.20.11	And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.
NUM.20.12	And the 
NUM.20.13	This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the 
NUM.20.14	And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:
NUM.20.15	How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:
NUM.20.16	And when we cried unto the 
NUM.20.17	Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.
NUM.20.18	And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.
NUM.20.19	And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing any thing else, go through on my feet.
NUM.20.20	And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
NUM.20.21	Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.
NUM.20.22	And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.
NUM.20.23	And the 
NUM.20.24	Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.
NUM.20.25	Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:
NUM.20.26	And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.
NUM.20.27	And Moses did as the 
NUM.20.28	And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.
NUM.20.29	And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
NUM.21.1	And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.
NUM.21.2	And Israel vowed a vow unto the 
NUM.21.3	And the 
NUM.21.4	And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
NUM.21.5	And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.
NUM.21.6	And the 
NUM.21.7	Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the 
NUM.21.8	And the 
NUM.21.9	And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
NUM.21.10	And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
NUM.21.11	And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Iye–abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.
NUM.21.12	From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zered.
NUM.21.13	From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
NUM.21.14	Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the 
NUM.21.15	And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.
NUM.21.16	And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the 
NUM.21.17	Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:
NUM.21.18	The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:
NUM.21.19	And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
NUM.21.20	And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.
NUM.21.21	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
NUM.21.22	Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders.
NUM.21.23	And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
NUM.21.24	And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
NUM.21.25	And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.
NUM.21.26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.
NUM.21.27	Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:
NUM.21.28	For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.
NUM.21.29	Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
NUM.21.30	We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.
NUM.21.31	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
NUM.21.32	And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.
NUM.21.33	And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
NUM.21.34	And the 
NUM.21.35	So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.
NUM.22.1	And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.
NUM.22.2	And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
NUM.22.3	And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
NUM.22.4	And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.
NUM.22.5	He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:
NUM.22.6	Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.
NUM.22.7	And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.
NUM.22.8	And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the 
NUM.22.9	And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?
NUM.22.10	And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,
NUM.22.11	Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.
NUM.22.12	And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.
NUM.22.13	And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the 
NUM.22.14	And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.
NUM.22.15	And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.
NUM.22.16	And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:
NUM.22.17	For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.
NUM.22.18	And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the 
NUM.22.19	Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the 
NUM.22.20	And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.
NUM.22.21	And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
NUM.22.22	And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the 
NUM.22.23	And the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.24	But the angel of the 
NUM.22.25	And when the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.26	And the angel of the 
NUM.22.27	And when the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.28	And the 
NUM.22.29	And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.
NUM.22.30	And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.
NUM.22.31	Then the 
NUM.22.32	And the angel of the 
NUM.22.33	And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.
NUM.22.34	And Balaam said unto the angel of the 
NUM.22.35	And the angel of the 
NUM.22.36	And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.
NUM.22.37	And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?
NUM.22.38	And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.
NUM.22.39	And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath–huzoth.
NUM.22.40	And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.
NUM.22.41	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.
NUM.23.1	And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.
NUM.23.2	And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
NUM.23.3	And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the 
NUM.23.4	And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.
NUM.23.5	And the 
NUM.23.6	And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.
NUM.23.7	And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.
NUM.23.8	How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the 
NUM.23.9	For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
NUM.23.10	Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!
NUM.23.11	And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.
NUM.23.12	And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the 
NUM.23.13	And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.
NUM.23.14	And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
NUM.23.15	And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet the 
NUM.23.16	And the 
NUM.23.17	And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the 
NUM.23.18	And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:
NUM.23.19	God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
NUM.23.20	Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
NUM.23.21	He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the 
NUM.23.22	God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.
NUM.23.23	Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!
NUM.23.24	Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.
NUM.23.25	And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
NUM.23.26	But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the 
NUM.23.27	And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.
NUM.23.28	And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.
NUM.23.29	And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
NUM.23.30	And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
NUM.24.1	And when Balaam saw that it pleased the 
NUM.24.2	And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.
NUM.24.3	And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
NUM.24.4	He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
NUM.24.5	How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!
NUM.24.6	As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the 
NUM.24.7	He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
NUM.24.8	God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.
NUM.24.9	He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.
NUM.24.10	And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.
NUM.24.11	Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the 
NUM.24.12	And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,
NUM.24.13	If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the 
NUM.24.14	And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.
NUM.24.15	And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
NUM.24.16	He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
NUM.24.17	I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.
NUM.24.18	And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.
NUM.24.19	Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.
NUM.24.20	And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.
NUM.24.21	And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.
NUM.24.22	Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.
NUM.24.23	And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!
NUM.24.24	And ships shall come from the coast of Kittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.
NUM.24.25	And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.
NUM.25.1	And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.
NUM.25.2	And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.
NUM.25.3	And Israel joined himself unto Baal–peor: and the anger of the 
NUM.25.4	And the 
NUM.25.5	And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal–peor.
NUM.25.6	And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
NUM.25.7	And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;
NUM.25.8	And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
NUM.25.9	And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
NUM.25.10	And the 
NUM.25.11	Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
NUM.25.12	Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:
NUM.25.13	And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.
NUM.25.14	Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.
NUM.25.15	And the name of the Midianite woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.
NUM.25.16	And the 
NUM.25.17	Vex the Midianites, and smite them:
NUM.25.18	For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.
NUM.26.1	And it came to pass after the plague, that the 
NUM.26.2	Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.
NUM.26.3	And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,
NUM.26.4	Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the 
NUM.26.5	Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben; Hanoch, of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu, the family of the Palluites:

NUM.26.52	And the 
NUM.26.53	Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.
NUM.26.54	To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance: to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him.
NUM.26.55	Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.
NUM.26.56	According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between many and few.
NUM.26.57	And these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites: of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites: of Merari, the family of the Merarites.

NUM.26.59	And the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt: and she bare unto Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister.
NUM.26.60	And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
NUM.26.61	And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before the 
NUM.26.62	And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.
NUM.26.63	These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.
NUM.26.64	But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
NUM.26.65	For the 
NUM.27.1	Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.
NUM.27.2	And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
NUM.27.3	Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the 
NUM.27.4	Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father.
NUM.27.5	And Moses brought their cause before the 
NUM.27.6	And the 
NUM.27.7	The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
NUM.27.8	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
NUM.27.9	And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.
NUM.27.10	And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren.
NUM.27.11	And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the 
NUM.27.12	And the 
NUM.27.13	And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.
NUM.27.14	For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.
NUM.27.15	And Moses spake unto the 
NUM.27.16	Let the

NUM.27.20	And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.
NUM.27.21	And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the 
NUM.27.22	And Moses did as the 
NUM.27.23	And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the 
NUM.28.1	And the 
NUM.28.2	Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.
NUM.28.3	And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the 
NUM.28.4	The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;
NUM.28.5	And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.
NUM.28.6	It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the

NUM.29.39	These things ye shall do unto the 
NUM.29.40	And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the 
NUM.30.1	And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the 
NUM.30.2	If a man vow a vow unto the 
NUM.30.3	If a woman also vow a vow unto the 
NUM.30.4	And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
NUM.30.5	But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the 
NUM.30.6	And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;
NUM.30.7	And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
NUM.30.8	But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the 
NUM.30.9	But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.
NUM.30.10	And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;
NUM.30.11	And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
NUM.30.12	But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the 
NUM.30.13	Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
NUM.30.14	But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
NUM.30.15	But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.
NUM.30.16	These are the statutes, which the 
NUM.31.1	And the 
NUM.31.2	Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
NUM.31.3	And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the 
NUM.31.4	Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.
NUM.31.5	So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
NUM.31.6	And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.
NUM.31.7	And they warred against the Midianites, as the 
NUM.31.8	And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
NUM.31.9	And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.
NUM.31.10	And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.
NUM.31.11	And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.
NUM.31.12	And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.
NUM.31.13	And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
NUM.31.14	And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.
NUM.31.15	And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
NUM.31.16	Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the 
NUM.31.17	Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
NUM.31.18	But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
NUM.31.19	And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.
NUM.31.20	And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.
NUM.31.21	And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the 
NUM.31.22	Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
NUM.31.23	Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water.
NUM.31.24	And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
NUM.31.25	And the 
NUM.31.26	Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:
NUM.31.27	And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:
NUM.31.28	And levy a tribute unto the 
NUM.31.29	Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the 
NUM.31.30	And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the 
NUM.31.31	And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the 
NUM.31.32	And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
NUM.31.33	And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,
NUM.31.34	And threescore and one thousand asses,
NUM.31.35	And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.
NUM.31.36	And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:
NUM.31.37	And the 
NUM.31.38	And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the 
NUM.31.39	And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the 
NUM.31.40	And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the 
NUM.31.41	And Moses gave the tribute, which was the 
NUM.31.42	And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,
NUM.31.43	(Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
NUM.31.44	And thirty and six thousand beeves,
NUM.31.45	And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,
NUM.31.46	And sixteen thousand persons;)
NUM.31.47	Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the 
NUM.31.48	And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:
NUM.31.49	And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.
NUM.31.50	We have therefore brought an oblation for the 
NUM.31.51	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.
NUM.31.52	And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the 
NUM.31.53	(For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
NUM.31.54	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the 
NUM.32.1	Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;
NUM.32.2	The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,
NUM.32.3	Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
NUM.32.4	Even the country which the 
NUM.32.5	Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.
NUM.32.6	And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?
NUM.32.7	And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the 
NUM.32.8	Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh–barnea to see the land.
NUM.32.9	For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the 
NUM.32.10	And the 
NUM.32.11	Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:
NUM.32.12	Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the 
NUM.32.13	And the 
NUM.32.14	And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the 
NUM.32.15	For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.
NUM.32.16	And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:
NUM.32.17	But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
NUM.32.18	We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
NUM.32.19	For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.
NUM.32.20	And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the 
NUM.32.21	And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the 
NUM.32.22	And the land be subdued before the 
NUM.32.23	But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the 
NUM.32.24	Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.
NUM.32.25	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.
NUM.32.26	Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:
NUM.32.27	But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the 
NUM.32.28	So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:
NUM.32.29	And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the 
NUM.32.30	But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
NUM.32.31	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the 
NUM.32.32	We will pass over armed before the 
NUM.32.33	And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.
NUM.32.34	And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
NUM.32.35	And Atroth Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,
NUM.32.36	And Beth–nimrah, and Beth–haran, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.
NUM.32.37	And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,
NUM.32.38	And Nebo, and Baal–meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.
NUM.32.39	And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.
NUM.32.40	And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.
NUM.32.41	And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havoth–jair.
NUM.32.42	And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.
NUM.33.1	These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
NUM.33.2	And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the 
NUM.33.3	And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.

NUM.33.50	And the 
NUM.33.51	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
NUM.33.52	Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:
NUM.33.53	And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.
NUM.33.54	And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.
NUM.33.55	But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.
NUM.33.56	Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.
NUM.34.1	And the 
NUM.34.2	Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)
NUM.34.3	Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:
NUM.34.4	And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh–barnea, and shall go on to Hazar–addar, and pass on to Azmon:
NUM.34.5	And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.
NUM.34.6	And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.
NUM.34.7	And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor:
NUM.34.8	From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:
NUM.34.9	And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar–enan: this shall be your north border.
NUM.34.10	And ye shall point out your east border from Hazar–enan to Shepham:
NUM.34.11	And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:
NUM.34.12	And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.
NUM.34.13	And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the 
NUM.34.14	For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:
NUM.34.15	The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.
NUM.34.16	And the 
NUM.34.17	These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
NUM.34.18	And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance.
NUM.34.19	And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
NUM.34.20	And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
NUM.34.21	Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.
NUM.34.22	And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli.
NUM.34.23	The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
NUM.34.24	And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.
NUM.34.25	And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.
NUM.34.26	And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan.
NUM.34.27	And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.
NUM.34.28	And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.
NUM.34.29	These are they whom the 
NUM.35.1	And the 
NUM.35.2	Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.
NUM.35.3	And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.
NUM.35.4	And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.
NUM.35.5	And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
NUM.35.6	And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.
NUM.35.7	So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.
NUM.35.8	And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.
NUM.35.9	And the 
NUM.35.10	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
NUM.35.11	Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.
NUM.35.12	And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.
NUM.35.13	And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge.
NUM.35.14	Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.
NUM.35.15	These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.
NUM.35.16	And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
NUM.35.17	And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
NUM.35.18	Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
NUM.35.19	The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.
NUM.35.20	But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;
NUM.35.21	Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.
NUM.35.22	But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait,
NUM.35.23	Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:
NUM.35.24	Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:
NUM.35.25	And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.
NUM.35.26	But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;
NUM.35.27	And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:
NUM.35.28	Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.
NUM.35.29	So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
NUM.35.30	Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.
NUM.35.31	Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.
NUM.35.32	And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
NUM.35.33	So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
NUM.35.34	Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the 
NUM.36.1	And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:
NUM.36.2	And they said, The 
NUM.36.3	And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
NUM.36.4	And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
NUM.36.5	And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the 
NUM.36.6	This is the thing which the 
NUM.36.7	So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
NUM.36.8	And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.
NUM.36.9	Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.
NUM.36.10	Even as the 
NUM.36.11	For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons:
NUM.36.12	And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
NUM.36.13	These are the commandments and the judgments, which the 
DEU.1.1	These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
DEU.1.2	(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh–barnea.)
DEU.1.3	And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the 
DEU.1.4	After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei:
DEU.1.5	On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
DEU.1.6	The 
DEU.1.7	Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.
DEU.1.8	Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the 
DEU.1.9	And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:
DEU.1.10	The 
DEU.1.11	(The 
DEU.1.12	How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
DEU.1.13	Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.
DEU.1.14	And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.
DEU.1.15	So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.
DEU.1.16	And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.
DEU.1.17	Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.
DEU.1.18	And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
DEU.1.19	And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the 
DEU.1.20	And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the 
DEU.1.21	Behold, the 
DEU.1.22	And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.
DEU.1.23	And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:
DEU.1.24	And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.
DEU.1.25	And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the 
DEU.1.26	Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the 
DEU.1.27	And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the 
DEU.1.28	Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.
DEU.1.29	Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
DEU.1.30	The 
DEU.1.31	And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the 
DEU.1.32	Yet in this thing ye did not believe the 
DEU.1.33	Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.
DEU.1.34	And the 
DEU.1.35	Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,
DEU.1.36	Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the 
DEU.1.37	Also the 
DEU.1.38	But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
DEU.1.39	Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
DEU.1.40	But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
DEU.1.41	Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the 
DEU.1.42	And the 
DEU.1.43	So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the 
DEU.1.44	And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.
DEU.1.45	And ye returned and wept before the 
DEU.1.46	So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.
DEU.2.1	Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the 
DEU.2.2	And the 
DEU.2.3	Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
DEU.2.4	And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:
DEU.2.5	Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.
DEU.2.6	Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
DEU.2.7	For the 
DEU.2.8	And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion–geber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
DEU.2.9	And the 
DEU.2.10	The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;
DEU.2.11	Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.
DEU.2.12	The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the 
DEU.2.13	Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.
DEU.2.14	And the space in which we came from Kadesh–barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the 
DEU.2.15	For indeed the hand of the 
DEU.2.16	So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
DEU.2.17	That the 
DEU.2.18	Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:
DEU.2.19	And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.
DEU.2.20	(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
DEU.2.21	A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the 
DEU.2.22	As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:
DEU.2.23	And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Gaza, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
DEU.2.24	Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.
DEU.2.25	This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
DEU.2.26	And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
DEU.2.27	Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.
DEU.2.28	Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;
DEU.2.29	(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the 
DEU.2.30	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the 
DEU.2.31	And the 
DEU.2.32	Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
DEU.2.33	And the 
DEU.2.34	And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:
DEU.2.35	Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
DEU.2.36	From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the 
DEU.2.37	Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the 
DEU.3.1	Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
DEU.3.2	And the 
DEU.3.3	So the 
DEU.3.4	And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
DEU.3.5	All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.
DEU.3.6	And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.
DEU.3.7	But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
DEU.3.8	And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;
DEU.3.9	(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Senir;)
DEU.3.10	All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
DEU.3.11	For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.
DEU.3.12	And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
DEU.3.13	And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.
DEU.3.14	Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan–havoth–jair, unto this day.
DEU.3.15	And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
DEU.3.16	And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
DEU.3.17	The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdoth–pisgah eastward.
DEU.3.18	And I commanded you at that time, saying, The 
DEU.3.19	But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;
DEU.3.20	Until the 
DEU.3.21	And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the 
DEU.3.22	Ye shall not fear them: for the 
DEU.3.23	And I besought the 
DEU.3.24	O Lord 
DEU.3.25	I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
DEU.3.26	But the 
DEU.3.27	Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
DEU.3.28	But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.
DEU.3.29	So we abode in the valley over against Beth–peor.
DEU.4.1	Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the 
DEU.4.2	Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the 
DEU.4.3	Your eyes have seen what the 
DEU.4.4	But ye that did cleave unto the 
DEU.4.5	Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the 
DEU.4.6	Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
DEU.4.7	For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the 
DEU.4.8	And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
DEU.4.9	Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;
DEU.4.10	Specially the day that thou stoodest before the 
DEU.4.11	And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.
DEU.4.12	And the 
DEU.4.13	And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.
DEU.4.14	And the 
DEU.4.15	Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the 
DEU.4.16	Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
DEU.4.17	The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,
DEU.4.18	The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:
DEU.4.19	And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the 
DEU.4.20	But the 
DEU.4.21	Furthermore the 
DEU.4.22	But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.
DEU.4.23	Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the 
DEU.4.24	For the 
DEU.4.25	When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the 
DEU.4.26	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
DEU.4.27	And the 
DEU.4.28	And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
DEU.4.29	But if from thence thou shalt seek the 
DEU.4.30	When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the 
DEU.4.31	(For the 
DEU.4.32	For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?
DEU.4.33	Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?
DEU.4.34	Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the 
DEU.4.35	Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the 
DEU.4.36	Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.
DEU.4.37	And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;
DEU.4.38	To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.
DEU.4.39	Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the 
DEU.4.40	Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the 
DEU.4.41	Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;
DEU.4.42	That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:
DEU.4.43	Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.
DEU.4.44	And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
DEU.4.45	These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt,
DEU.4.46	On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Beth–peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:
DEU.4.47	And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;
DEU.4.48	From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon,
DEU.4.49	And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.
DEU.5.1	And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.
DEU.5.2	The 
DEU.5.3	The 
DEU.5.4	The 
DEU.5.5	(I stood between the 
DEU.5.6	I am the 
DEU.5.7	Thou shalt have none other gods before me.
DEU.5.8	Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:
DEU.5.9	Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the 
DEU.5.10	And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
DEU.5.11	Thou shalt not take the name of the 
DEU.5.12	Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the 
DEU.5.13	Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:
DEU.5.14	But the seventh day is the sabbath of the 
DEU.5.15	And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the 
DEU.5.16	Honour thy father and thy mother, as the 
DEU.5.17	Thou shalt not kill.
DEU.5.18	Neither shalt thou commit adultery.
DEU.5.19	Neither shalt thou steal.
DEU.5.20	Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.
DEU.5.21	Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's.
DEU.5.22	These words the 
DEU.5.23	And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
DEU.5.24	And ye said, Behold, the 
DEU.5.25	Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the 
DEU.5.26	For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
DEU.5.27	Go thou near, and hear all that the 
DEU.5.28	And the 
DEU.5.29	O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
DEU.5.30	Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.
DEU.5.31	But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
DEU.5.32	Ye shall observe to do therefore as the 
DEU.5.33	Ye shall walk in all the ways which the 
DEU.6.1	Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the 
DEU.6.2	That thou mightest fear the 
DEU.6.3	Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the 
DEU.6.4	Hear, O Israel: The 
DEU.6.5	And thou shalt love the 
DEU.6.6	And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:
DEU.6.7	And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
DEU.6.8	And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.
DEU.6.9	And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.
DEU.6.10	And it shall be, when the 
DEU.6.11	And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;
DEU.6.12	Then beware lest thou forget the 
DEU.6.13	Thou shalt fear the 
DEU.6.14	Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you;
DEU.6.15	(For the 
DEU.6.16	Ye shall not tempt the 
DEU.6.17	Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the 
DEU.6.18	And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the 
DEU.6.19	To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the 
DEU.6.20	And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the 
DEU.6.21	Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the 
DEU.6.22	And the 
DEU.6.23	And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.
DEU.6.24	And the 
DEU.6.25	And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the 
DEU.7.1	When the 
DEU.7.2	And when the 
DEU.7.3	Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.
DEU.7.4	For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the 
DEU.7.5	But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.
DEU.7.6	For thou art an holy people unto the 
DEU.7.7	The 
DEU.7.8	But because the 
DEU.7.9	Know therefore that the 
DEU.7.10	And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.
DEU.7.11	Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.
DEU.7.12	Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the 
DEU.7.13	And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.
DEU.7.14	Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.
DEU.7.15	And the 
DEU.7.16	And thou shalt consume all the people which the 
DEU.7.17	If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?
DEU.7.18	Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the 
DEU.7.19	The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the 
DEU.7.20	Moreover the 
DEU.7.21	Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the 
DEU.7.22	And the 
DEU.7.23	But the 
DEU.7.24	And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.
DEU.7.25	The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the 
DEU.7.26	Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.
DEU.8.1	All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the 
DEU.8.2	And thou shalt remember all the way which the 
DEU.8.3	And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the 
DEU.8.4	Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.
DEU.8.5	Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the 
DEU.8.6	Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the 
DEU.8.7	For the 
DEU.8.8	A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;
DEU.8.9	A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.
DEU.8.10	When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the 
DEU.8.11	Beware that thou forget not the 
DEU.8.12	Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;
DEU.8.13	And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;
DEU.8.14	Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the 
DEU.8.15	Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;
DEU.8.16	Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;
DEU.8.17	And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.
DEU.8.18	But thou shalt remember the 
DEU.8.19	And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the 
DEU.8.20	As the nations which the 
DEU.9.1	Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,
DEU.9.2	A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!
DEU.9.3	Understand therefore this day, that the 
DEU.9.4	Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the 
DEU.9.5	Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the 
DEU.9.6	Understand therefore, that the 
DEU.9.7	Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the 
DEU.9.8	Also in Horeb ye provoked the 
DEU.9.9	When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the 
DEU.9.10	And the 
DEU.9.11	And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the 
DEU.9.12	And the 
DEU.9.13	Furthermore the 
DEU.9.14	Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
DEU.9.15	So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
DEU.9.16	And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the 
DEU.9.17	And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.
DEU.9.18	And I fell down before the 
DEU.9.19	For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the 
DEU.9.20	And the 
DEU.9.21	And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.
DEU.9.22	And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth–hattaavah, ye provoked the 
DEU.9.23	Likewise when the 
DEU.9.24	Ye have been rebellious against the 
DEU.9.25	Thus I fell down before the 
DEU.9.26	I prayed therefore unto the 
DEU.9.27	Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:
DEU.9.28	Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the 
DEU.9.29	Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.
DEU.10.1	At that time the 
DEU.10.2	And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.
DEU.10.3	And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.
DEU.10.4	And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the 
DEU.10.5	And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the 
DEU.10.6	And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Moserah: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.
DEU.10.7	From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of rivers of waters.
DEU.10.8	At that time the 
DEU.10.9	Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the 
DEU.10.10	And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the 
DEU.10.11	And the 
DEU.10.12	And now, Israel, what doth the 
DEU.10.13	To keep the commandments of the 
DEU.10.14	Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the 
DEU.10.15	Only the 
DEU.10.16	Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.
DEU.10.17	For the 
DEU.10.18	He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.
DEU.10.19	Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
DEU.10.20	Thou shalt fear the 
DEU.10.21	He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.
DEU.10.22	Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the 
DEU.11.1	Therefore thou shalt love the 
DEU.11.2	And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the 
DEU.11.3	And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;
DEU.11.4	And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the 
DEU.11.5	And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;
DEU.11.6	And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:
DEU.11.7	But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the 
DEU.11.8	Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;
DEU.11.9	And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the 
DEU.11.10	For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:
DEU.11.11	But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:
DEU.11.12	A land which the 
DEU.11.13	And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the 
DEU.11.14	That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.
DEU.11.15	And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.
DEU.11.16	Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
DEU.11.17	And then the 
DEU.11.18	Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.
DEU.11.19	And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
DEU.11.20	And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:
DEU.11.21	That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the 
DEU.11.22	For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the 
DEU.11.23	Then will the 
DEU.11.24	Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.
DEU.11.25	There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the 
DEU.11.26	Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;
DEU.11.27	A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the 
DEU.11.28	And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the 
DEU.11.29	And it shall come to pass, when the 
DEU.11.30	Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?
DEU.11.31	For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the 
DEU.11.32	And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.
DEU.12.1	These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the 
DEU.12.2	Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:
DEU.12.3	And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.
DEU.12.4	Ye shall not do so unto the 
DEU.12.5	But unto the place which the 
DEU.12.6	And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:
DEU.12.7	And there ye shall eat before the 
DEU.12.8	Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.
DEU.12.9	For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the 
DEU.12.10	But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the 
DEU.12.11	Then there shall be a place which the 
DEU.12.12	And ye shall rejoice before the 
DEU.12.13	Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest:
DEU.12.14	But in the place which the 
DEU.12.15	Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the 
DEU.12.16	Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.
DEU.12.17	Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:
DEU.12.18	But thou must eat them before the 
DEU.12.19	Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.
DEU.12.20	When the 
DEU.12.21	If the place which the 
DEU.12.22	Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.
DEU.12.23	Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.
DEU.12.24	Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.
DEU.12.25	Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the 
DEU.12.26	Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the 
DEU.12.27	And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the 
DEU.12.28	Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the 
DEU.12.29	When the 
DEU.12.30	Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
DEU.12.31	Thou shalt not do so unto the 
DEU.12.32	What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
DEU.13.1	If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,
DEU.13.2	And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;
DEU.13.3	Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the 
DEU.13.4	Ye shall walk after the 
DEU.13.5	And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the 
DEU.13.6	If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;
DEU.13.7	Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;
DEU.13.8	Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:
DEU.13.9	But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
DEU.13.10	And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the 
DEU.13.11	And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.
DEU.13.12	If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the 
DEU.13.13	Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;
DEU.13.14	Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you;
DEU.13.15	Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.
DEU.13.16	And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the 
DEU.13.17	And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the 
DEU.13.18	When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the 
DEU.14.1	Ye are the children of the 
DEU.14.2	For thou art an holy people unto the 
DEU.14.3	Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.
DEU.14.4	These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,
DEU.14.5	The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.
DEU.14.6	And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat.
DEU.14.7	Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.
DEU.14.8	And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.
DEU.14.9	These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat:
DEU.14.10	And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you.
DEU.14.11	Of all clean birds ye shall eat.
DEU.14.12	But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,
DEU.14.13	And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,
DEU.14.14	And every raven after his kind,
DEU.14.15	And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,
DEU.14.16	The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,
DEU.14.17	And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,
DEU.14.18	And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
DEU.14.19	And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.
DEU.14.20	But of all clean fowls ye may eat.
DEU.14.21	Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the 
DEU.14.22	Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year.
DEU.14.23	And thou shalt eat before the 
DEU.14.24	And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the 
DEU.14.25	Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the 
DEU.14.26	And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the 
DEU.14.27	And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.
DEU.14.28	At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:
DEU.14.29	And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the 
DEU.15.1	At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.
DEU.15.2	And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the 
DEU.15.3	Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;
DEU.15.4	Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the 
DEU.15.5	Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the 
DEU.15.6	For the 
DEU.15.7	If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the 
DEU.15.8	But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.
DEU.15.9	Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the 
DEU.15.10	Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the 
DEU.15.11	For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.
DEU.15.12	And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.
DEU.15.13	And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty:
DEU.15.14	Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the 
DEU.15.15	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the 
DEU.15.16	And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;
DEU.15.17	Then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.
DEU.15.18	It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in serving thee six years: and the 
DEU.15.19	All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the 
DEU.15.20	Thou shalt eat it before the 
DEU.15.21	And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the 
DEU.15.22	Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.
DEU.15.23	Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.
DEU.16.1	Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the 
DEU.16.2	Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the 
DEU.16.3	Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.
DEU.16.4	And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.
DEU.16.5	Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the 
DEU.16.6	But at the place which the 
DEU.16.7	And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the 
DEU.16.8	Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the 
DEU.16.9	Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn.
DEU.16.10	And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the 
DEU.16.11	And thou shalt rejoice before the 
DEU.16.12	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.
DEU.16.13	Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:
DEU.16.14	And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.
DEU.16.15	Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the 
DEU.16.16	Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the 
DEU.16.17	Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the 
DEU.16.18	Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the 
DEU.16.19	Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.
DEU.16.20	That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the 
DEU.16.21	Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the 
DEU.16.22	Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the 
DEU.17.1	Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the 
DEU.17.2	If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the 
DEU.17.3	And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;
DEU.17.4	And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel:
DEU.17.5	Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.
DEU.17.6	At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.
DEU.17.7	The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put the evil away from among you.
DEU.17.8	If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the 
DEU.17.9	And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:
DEU.17.10	And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the 
DEU.17.11	According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.
DEU.17.12	And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the 
DEU.17.13	And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
DEU.17.14	When thou art come unto the land which the 
DEU.17.15	Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the 
DEU.17.16	But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the 
DEU.17.17	Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
DEU.17.18	And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:
DEU.17.19	And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the 
DEU.17.20	That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.
DEU.18.1	The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the 
DEU.18.2	Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the 
DEU.18.3	And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.
DEU.18.4	The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.
DEU.18.5	For the 
DEU.18.6	And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the 
DEU.18.7	Then he shall minister in the name of the 
DEU.18.8	They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.
DEU.18.9	When thou art come into the land which the 
DEU.18.10	There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,
DEU.18.11	Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.
DEU.18.12	For all that do these things are an abomination unto the 
DEU.18.13	Thou shalt be perfect with the 
DEU.18.14	For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the 
DEU.18.15	The 
DEU.18.16	According to all that thou desiredst of the 
DEU.18.17	And the 
DEU.18.18	I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.
DEU.18.19	And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.
DEU.18.20	But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.
DEU.18.21	And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the 
DEU.18.22	When a prophet speaketh in the name of the 
DEU.19.1	When the 
DEU.19.2	Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the 
DEU.19.3	Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the 
DEU.19.4	And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;
DEU.19.5	As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:
DEU.19.6	Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
DEU.19.7	Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.
DEU.19.8	And if the 
DEU.19.9	If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the 
DEU.19.10	That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the 
DEU.19.11	But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities:
DEU.19.12	Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.
DEU.19.13	Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.
DEU.19.14	Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the 
DEU.19.15	One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.
DEU.19.16	If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;
DEU.19.17	Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the 
DEU.19.18	And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother;
DEU.19.19	Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.
DEU.19.20	And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.
DEU.19.21	And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
DEU.20.1	When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the 
DEU.20.2	And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,
DEU.20.3	And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;
DEU.20.4	For the 
DEU.20.5	And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.
DEU.20.6	And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.
DEU.20.7	And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.
DEU.20.8	And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart.
DEU.20.9	And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.
DEU.20.10	When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.
DEU.20.11	And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.
DEU.20.12	And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:
DEU.20.13	And when the 
DEU.20.14	But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the 
DEU.20.15	Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.
DEU.20.16	But of the cities of these people, which the 
DEU.20.17	But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the 
DEU.20.18	That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the 
DEU.20.19	When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:
DEU.20.20	Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.
DEU.21.1	If one be found slain in the land which the 
DEU.21.2	Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:
DEU.21.3	And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;
DEU.21.4	And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:
DEU.21.5	And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the 
DEU.21.6	And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:
DEU.21.7	And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.
DEU.21.8	Be merciful, O 
DEU.21.9	So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the 
DEU.21.10	When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the 
DEU.21.11	And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;
DEU.21.12	Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;
DEU.21.13	And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.
DEU.21.14	And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.
DEU.21.15	If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:
DEU.21.16	Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn:
DEU.21.17	But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.
DEU.21.18	If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:
DEU.21.19	Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;
DEU.21.20	And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.
DEU.21.21	And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
DEU.21.22	And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:
DEU.21.23	His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the 
DEU.22.1	Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother.
DEU.22.2	And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.
DEU.22.3	In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.
DEU.22.4	Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.
DEU.22.5	The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the 
DEU.22.6	If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:
DEU.22.7	But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days.
DEU.22.8	When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence.
DEU.22.9	Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled.
DEU.22.10	Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.
DEU.22.11	Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen together.
DEU.22.12	Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.
DEU.22.13	If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,
DEU.22.14	And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid:
DEU.22.15	Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate:
DEU.22.16	And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;
DEU.22.17	And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
DEU.22.18	And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;
DEU.22.19	And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
DEU.22.20	But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:
DEU.22.21	Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.
DEU.22.22	If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.
DEU.22.23	If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;
DEU.22.24	Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.
DEU.22.25	But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die:
DEU.22.26	But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter:
DEU.22.27	For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.
DEU.22.28	If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;
DEU.22.29	Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.
DEU.22.30	A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his father's skirt.
DEU.23.1	He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the 
DEU.23.2	A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the 
DEU.23.3	An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the 
DEU.23.4	Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.
DEU.23.5	Nevertheless the 
DEU.23.6	Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.
DEU.23.7	Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land.
DEU.23.8	The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the 
DEU.23.9	When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing.
DEU.23.10	If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:
DEU.23.11	But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.
DEU.23.12	Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:
DEU.23.13	And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:
DEU.23.14	For the 
DEU.23.15	Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee:
DEU.23.16	He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him.
DEU.23.17	There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel.
DEU.23.18	Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the 
DEU.23.19	Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:
DEU.23.20	Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the 
DEU.23.21	When thou shalt vow a vow unto the 
DEU.23.22	But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.
DEU.23.23	That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the 
DEU.23.24	When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel.
DEU.23.25	When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn.
DEU.24.1	When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.
DEU.24.2	And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife.
DEU.24.3	And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;
DEU.24.4	Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the 
DEU.24.5	When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.
DEU.24.6	No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh a man's life to pledge.
DEU.24.7	If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.
DEU.24.8	Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.
DEU.24.9	Remember what the 
DEU.24.10	When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.
DEU.24.11	Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.
DEU.24.12	And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:
DEU.24.13	In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the 
DEU.24.14	Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates:
DEU.24.15	At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the 
DEU.24.16	The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
DEU.24.17	Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:
DEU.24.18	But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the 
DEU.24.19	When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the 
DEU.24.20	When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
DEU.24.21	When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
DEU.24.22	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.
DEU.25.1	If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.
DEU.25.2	And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.
DEU.25.3	Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.
DEU.25.4	Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.
DEU.25.5	If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her.
DEU.25.6	And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel.
DEU.25.7	And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother.
DEU.25.8	Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;
DEU.25.9	Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house.
DEU.25.10	And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.
DEU.25.11	When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets:
DEU.25.12	Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her.
DEU.25.13	Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small.
DEU.25.14	Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small.
DEU.25.15	But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the 
DEU.25.16	For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the 
DEU.25.17	Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt;
DEU.25.18	How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.
DEU.25.19	Therefore it shall be, when the 
DEU.26.1	And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the 
DEU.26.2	That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the 
DEU.26.3	And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the 
DEU.26.4	And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the 
DEU.26.5	And thou shalt speak and say before the 
DEU.26.6	And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:
DEU.26.7	And when we cried unto the 
DEU.26.8	And the 
DEU.26.9	And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.
DEU.26.10	And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O 
DEU.26.11	And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the 
DEU.26.12	When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;
DEU.26.13	Then thou shalt say before the 
DEU.26.14	I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the 
DEU.26.15	Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
DEU.26.16	This day the 
DEU.26.17	Thou hast avouched the 
DEU.26.18	And the 
DEU.26.19	And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the 
DEU.27.1	And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.
DEU.27.2	And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the 
DEU.27.3	And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the 
DEU.27.4	Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster.
DEU.27.5	And there shalt thou build an altar unto the 
DEU.27.6	Thou shalt build the altar of the 
DEU.27.7	And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before the 
DEU.27.8	And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.
DEU.27.9	And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the 
DEU.27.10	Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the 
DEU.27.11	And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,
DEU.27.12	These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:
DEU.27.13	And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
DEU.27.14	And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,
DEU.27.15	Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the 
DEU.27.16	Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.17	Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.18	Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.19	Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.20	Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.21	Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.22	Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.23	Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.24	Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.25	Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.26	Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.28.1	And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the 
DEU.28.2	And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the 
DEU.28.3	Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field.
DEU.28.4	Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.
DEU.28.5	Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.
DEU.28.6	Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out.
DEU.28.7	The 
DEU.28.8	The 
DEU.28.9	The 
DEU.28.10	And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the 
DEU.28.11	And the 
DEU.28.12	The 
DEU.28.13	And the 
DEU.28.14	And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
DEU.28.15	But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the 
DEU.28.16	Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.
DEU.28.17	Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.
DEU.28.18	Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.
DEU.28.19	Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out.
DEU.28.20	The 
DEU.28.21	The 
DEU.28.22	The 
DEU.28.23	And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron.
DEU.28.24	The 
DEU.28.25	The 
DEU.28.26	And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.
DEU.28.27	The 
DEU.28.28	The 
DEU.28.29	And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee.
DEU.28.30	Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.
DEU.28.31	Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them.
DEU.28.32	Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long: and there shall be no might in thine hand.
DEU.28.33	The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:
DEU.28.34	So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
DEU.28.35	The 
DEU.28.36	The 
DEU.28.37	And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the 
DEU.28.38	Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.
DEU.28.39	Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.
DEU.28.40	Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his fruit.
DEU.28.41	Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.
DEU.28.42	All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.
DEU.28.43	The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low.
DEU.28.44	He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.
DEU.28.45	Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the 
DEU.28.46	And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.
DEU.28.47	Because thou servedst not the 
DEU.28.48	Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the 
DEU.28.49	The 
DEU.28.50	A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:
DEU.28.51	And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.
DEU.28.52	And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the 
DEU.28.53	And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the 
DEU.28.54	So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:
DEU.28.55	So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.
DEU.28.56	The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,
DEU.28.57	And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.
DEU.28.58	If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE 
DEU.28.59	Then the 
DEU.28.60	Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.
DEU.28.61	Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the 
DEU.28.62	And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the 
DEU.28.63	And it shall come to pass, that as the 
DEU.28.64	And the 
DEU.28.65	And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the 
DEU.28.66	And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:
DEU.28.67	In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
DEU.28.68	And the 
DEU.29.1	These are the words of the covenant, which the 
DEU.29.2	And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that the 
DEU.29.3	The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:
DEU.29.4	Yet the 
DEU.29.5	And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.
DEU.29.6	Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I am the 
DEU.29.7	And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:
DEU.29.8	And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.
DEU.29.9	Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.
DEU.29.10	Ye stand this day all of you before the 
DEU.29.11	Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:
DEU.29.12	That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the 
DEU.29.13	That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
DEU.29.14	Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;
DEU.29.15	But with him that standeth here with us this day before the 
DEU.29.16	(For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by;
DEU.29.17	And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)
DEU.29.18	Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the 
DEU.29.19	And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:
DEU.29.20	The 
DEU.29.21	And the 
DEU.29.22	So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the 
DEU.29.23	And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which the 
DEU.29.24	Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the 
DEU.29.25	Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the 
DEU.29.26	For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:
DEU.29.27	And the anger of the 
DEU.29.28	And the 
DEU.29.29	The secret things belong unto the 
DEU.30.1	And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the 
DEU.30.2	And shalt return unto the 
DEU.30.3	That then the 
DEU.30.4	If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the 
DEU.30.5	And the 
DEU.30.6	And the 
DEU.30.7	And the 
DEU.30.8	And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the 
DEU.30.9	And the 
DEU.30.10	If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the 
DEU.30.11	For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.
DEU.30.12	It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?
DEU.30.13	Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?
DEU.30.14	But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.
DEU.30.15	See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;
DEU.30.16	In that I command thee this day to love the 
DEU.30.17	But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
DEU.30.18	I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.
DEU.30.19	I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:
DEU.30.20	That thou mayest love the 
DEU.31.1	And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.
DEU.31.2	And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the 
DEU.31.3	The 
DEU.31.4	And the 
DEU.31.5	And the 
DEU.31.6	Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the 
DEU.31.7	And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the 
DEU.31.8	And the 
DEU.31.9	And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.10	And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
DEU.31.11	When all Israel is come to appear before the 
DEU.31.12	Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the 
DEU.31.13	And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the 
DEU.31.14	And the 
DEU.31.15	And the 
DEU.31.16	And the 
DEU.31.17	Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?
DEU.31.18	And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.
DEU.31.19	Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
DEU.31.20	For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.
DEU.31.21	And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.
DEU.31.22	Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
DEU.31.23	And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.
DEU.31.24	And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
DEU.31.25	That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.26	Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.27	For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the 
DEU.31.28	Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.
DEU.31.29	For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the 
DEU.31.30	And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.
DEU.32.1	Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
DEU.32.2	My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:
DEU.32.3	Because I will publish the name of the 
DEU.32.4	He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.
DEU.32.5	They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.
DEU.32.6	Do ye thus requite the 
DEU.32.7	Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.
DEU.32.8	When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.
DEU.32.9	For the 
DEU.32.10	He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.
DEU.32.11	As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:
DEU.32.12	So the 
DEU.32.13	He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;
DEU.32.14	Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.
DEU.32.15	But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
DEU.32.16	They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.
DEU.32.17	They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.
DEU.32.18	Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.
DEU.32.19	And when the 
DEU.32.20	And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.
DEU.32.21	They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
DEU.32.22	For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
DEU.32.23	I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.
DEU.32.24	They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.
DEU.32.25	The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.
DEU.32.26	I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:
DEU.32.27	Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the 
DEU.32.28	For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.
DEU.32.29	O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!
DEU.32.30	How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the 
DEU.32.31	For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.
DEU.32.32	For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:
DEU.32.33	Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.
DEU.32.34	Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?
DEU.32.35	To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.
DEU.32.36	For the 
DEU.32.37	And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,
DEU.32.38	Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.
DEU.32.39	See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.
DEU.32.40	For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.
DEU.32.41	If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.
DEU.32.42	I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.
DEU.32.43	Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.
DEU.32.44	And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
DEU.32.45	And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:
DEU.32.46	And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.
DEU.32.47	For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
DEU.32.48	And the 
DEU.32.49	Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:
DEU.32.50	And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:
DEU.32.51	Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah–kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
DEU.32.52	Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.
DEU.33.1	And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
DEU.33.2	And he said, The 
DEU.33.3	Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.
DEU.33.4	Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.
DEU.33.5	And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.
DEU.33.6	Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.
DEU.33.7	And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, 
DEU.33.8	And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
DEU.33.9	Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.
DEU.33.10	They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.
DEU.33.11	Bless, 
DEU.33.12	And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the 
DEU.33.13	And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the 
DEU.33.14	And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,
DEU.33.15	And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,
DEU.33.16	And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.
DEU.33.17	His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.
DEU.33.18	And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.
DEU.33.19	They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.
DEU.33.20	And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.
DEU.33.21	And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the 
DEU.33.22	And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.
DEU.33.23	And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the 
DEU.33.24	And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.
DEU.33.25	Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.
DEU.33.26	There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.
DEU.33.27	The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.
DEU.33.28	Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.
DEU.33.29	Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the 
DEU.34.1	And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the 
DEU.34.2	And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,
DEU.34.3	And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.
DEU.34.4	And the 
DEU.34.5	So Moses the servant of the 
DEU.34.6	And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth–peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.
DEU.34.7	And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
DEU.34.8	And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
DEU.34.9	And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the 
DEU.34.10	And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the 
DEU.34.11	In all the signs and the wonders, which the 
DEU.34.12	And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.
JOS.1.1	Now after the death of Moses the servant of the 
JOS.1.2	Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.
JOS.1.3	Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.
JOS.1.4	From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.
JOS.1.5	There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
JOS.1.6	Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.
JOS.1.7	Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.
JOS.1.8	This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
JOS.1.9	Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the 
JOS.1.10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
JOS.1.11	Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the 
JOS.1.12	And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,
JOS.1.13	Remember the word which Moses the servant of the 
JOS.1.14	Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;
JOS.1.15	Until the 
JOS.1.16	And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.
JOS.1.17	According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the 
JOS.1.18	Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.
JOS.2.1	And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.
JOS.2.2	And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.
JOS.2.3	And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.
JOS.2.4	And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:
JOS.2.5	And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.
JOS.2.6	But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
JOS.2.7	And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.
JOS.2.8	And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;
JOS.2.9	And she said unto the men, I know that the 
JOS.2.10	For we have heard how the 
JOS.2.11	And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the 
JOS.2.12	Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the 
JOS.2.13	And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.
JOS.2.14	And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the 
JOS.2.15	Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
JOS.2.16	And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.
JOS.2.17	And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.
JOS.2.18	Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.
JOS.2.19	And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.
JOS.2.20	And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
JOS.2.21	And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
JOS.2.22	And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.
JOS.2.23	So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:
JOS.2.24	And they said unto Joshua, Truly the 
JOS.3.1	And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.
JOS.3.2	And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;
JOS.3.3	And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.3.4	Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
JOS.3.5	And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the 
JOS.3.6	And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
JOS.3.7	And the 
JOS.3.8	And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.
JOS.3.9	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the 
JOS.3.10	And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
JOS.3.11	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.
JOS.3.12	Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.
JOS.3.13	And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the 
JOS.3.14	And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;
JOS.3.15	And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)
JOS.3.16	That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zarethan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.
JOS.3.17	And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.1	And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the 
JOS.4.2	Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
JOS.4.3	And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.
JOS.4.4	Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:
JOS.4.5	And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the 
JOS.4.6	That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?
JOS.4.7	Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.8	And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the 
JOS.4.9	And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.
JOS.4.10	For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the 
JOS.4.11	And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the 
JOS.4.12	And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:
JOS.4.13	About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the 
JOS.4.14	On that day the 
JOS.4.15	And the 
JOS.4.16	Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.
JOS.4.17	Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.
JOS.4.18	And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.19	And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
JOS.4.20	And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.
JOS.4.21	And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?
JOS.4.22	Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
JOS.4.23	For the 
JOS.4.24	That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the 
JOS.5.1	And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the 
JOS.5.2	At that time the 
JOS.5.3	And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
JOS.5.4	And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
JOS.5.5	Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.
JOS.5.6	For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the 
JOS.5.7	And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.
JOS.5.8	And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
JOS.5.9	And the 
JOS.5.10	And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.
JOS.5.11	And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.
JOS.5.12	And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
JOS.5.13	And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?
JOS.5.14	And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the 
JOS.5.15	And the captain of the 
JOS.6.1	Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.
JOS.6.2	And the 
JOS.6.3	And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.
JOS.6.4	And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.
JOS.6.5	And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.
JOS.6.6	And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the 
JOS.6.7	And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the 
JOS.6.8	And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the 
JOS.6.9	And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rearward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
JOS.6.10	And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.
JOS.6.11	So the ark of the 
JOS.6.12	And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the 
JOS.6.13	And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the 
JOS.6.14	And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.
JOS.6.15	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
JOS.6.16	And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the 
JOS.6.17	And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the 
JOS.6.18	And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.
JOS.6.19	But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the 
JOS.6.20	So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
JOS.6.21	And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
JOS.6.22	But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.
JOS.6.23	And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.
JOS.6.24	And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the 
JOS.6.25	And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
JOS.6.26	And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the 
JOS.6.27	So the 
JOS.7.1	But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the 
JOS.7.2	And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth–aven, on the east side of Beth–el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.
JOS.7.3	And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.
JOS.7.4	So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.
JOS.7.5	And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
JOS.7.6	And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the 
JOS.7.7	And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord 
JOS.7.8	O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!
JOS.7.9	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?
JOS.7.10	And the 
JOS.7.11	Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.
JOS.7.12	Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.
JOS.7.13	Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the 
JOS.7.14	In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the 
JOS.7.15	And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the 
JOS.7.16	So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
JOS.7.17	And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
JOS.7.18	And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
JOS.7.19	And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the 
JOS.7.20	And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the 
JOS.7.21	When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
JOS.7.23	And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the 
JOS.7.24	And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.
JOS.7.25	And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the 
JOS.7.26	And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the 
JOS.8.1	And the 
JOS.8.2	And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
JOS.8.3	So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.
JOS.8.4	And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:
JOS.8.5	And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,
JOS.8.6	(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.
JOS.8.7	Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the 
JOS.8.8	And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the 
JOS.8.9	Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beth–el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
JOS.8.10	And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
JOS.8.11	And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.
JOS.8.12	And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Beth–el and Ai, on the west side of the city.
JOS.8.13	And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
JOS.8.14	And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.
JOS.8.15	And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
JOS.8.16	And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
JOS.8.17	And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth–el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
JOS.8.18	And the 
JOS.8.19	And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.
JOS.8.20	And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
JOS.8.21	And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.
JOS.8.22	And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
JOS.8.23	And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
JOS.8.25	And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.
JOS.8.26	For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
JOS.8.27	Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the 
JOS.8.28	And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.
JOS.8.29	And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.
JOS.8.30	Then Joshua built an altar unto the 
JOS.8.31	As Moses the servant of the 
JOS.8.32	And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.
JOS.8.33	And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.8.34	And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
JOS.8.35	There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.
JOS.9.1	And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;
JOS.9.2	That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
JOS.9.3	And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,
JOS.9.4	They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;
JOS.9.5	And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy.
JOS.9.6	And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.
JOS.9.7	And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?
JOS.9.8	And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?
JOS.9.9	And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the 
JOS.9.10	And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.
JOS.9.11	Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.
JOS.9.12	This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:
JOS.9.13	And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.
JOS.9.14	And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the 
JOS.9.15	And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.
JOS.9.16	And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.
JOS.9.17	And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath–jearim.
JOS.9.18	And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the 
JOS.9.19	But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the 
JOS.9.20	This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.
JOS.9.21	And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.
JOS.9.22	And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?
JOS.9.23	Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
JOS.9.24	And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the 
JOS.9.25	And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.
JOS.9.26	And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.
JOS.9.27	And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the 
JOS.10.1	Now it came to pass, when Adoni–zedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
JOS.10.2	That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.
JOS.10.3	Wherefore Adoni–zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,
JOS.10.4	Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
JOS.10.5	Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
JOS.10.6	And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.
JOS.10.7	So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.
JOS.10.8	And the 
JOS.10.9	Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.
JOS.10.10	And the 
JOS.10.11	And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth–horon, that the 
JOS.10.12	Then spake Joshua to the 
JOS.10.13	And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
JOS.10.14	And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the 
JOS.10.15	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
JOS.10.16	But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
JOS.10.17	And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.
JOS.10.18	And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:
JOS.10.19	And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the 
JOS.10.20	And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.
JOS.10.21	And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
JOS.10.22	Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.
JOS.10.23	And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
JOS.10.24	And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
JOS.10.25	And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the 
JOS.10.26	And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
JOS.10.27	And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.
JOS.10.28	And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.
JOS.10.29	Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:
JOS.10.30	And the 
JOS.10.31	And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:
JOS.10.32	And the 
JOS.10.33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
JOS.10.34	And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:
JOS.10.35	And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
JOS.10.36	And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:
JOS.10.37	And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.
JOS.10.38	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:
JOS.10.39	And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.
JOS.10.40	So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the 
JOS.10.41	And Joshua smote them from Kadesh–barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.
JOS.10.42	And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the 
JOS.10.43	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
JOS.11.1	And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
JOS.11.2	And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,
JOS.11.3	And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
JOS.11.4	And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.
JOS.11.5	And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
JOS.11.6	And the 
JOS.11.7	So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.
JOS.11.8	And the 
JOS.11.9	And Joshua did unto them as the 
JOS.11.10	And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.
JOS.11.11	And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.
JOS.11.12	And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the 
JOS.11.13	But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
JOS.11.14	And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.
JOS.11.15	As the 
JOS.11.16	So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;
JOS.11.17	Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal–gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.
JOS.11.18	Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
JOS.11.19	There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.
JOS.11.20	For it was of the 
JOS.11.21	And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.
JOS.11.22	There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
JOS.11.23	So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the 
JOS.12.1	Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:
JOS.12.2	Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
JOS.12.3	And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Beth–jeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdoth–pisgah:
JOS.12.4	And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
JOS.12.5	And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
JOS.12.6	Them did Moses the servant of the 
JOS.12.7	And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baal–gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;
JOS.12.8	In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
JOS.12.9	The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Beth–el, one;
JOS.12.10	The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
JOS.12.11	The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
JOS.12.12	The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
JOS.12.13	The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
JOS.12.14	The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
JOS.12.15	The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
JOS.12.16	The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Beth–el, one;
JOS.12.17	The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
JOS.12.18	The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;
JOS.12.19	The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
JOS.12.20	The king of Shimron–meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
JOS.12.21	The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
JOS.12.22	The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;
JOS.12.23	The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one;
JOS.12.24	The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.
JOS.13.1	Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the 
JOS.13.2	This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,
JOS.13.3	From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:
JOS.13.4	From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:
JOS.13.5	And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal–gad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.
JOS.13.6	All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth–maim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
JOS.13.7	Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
JOS.13.8	With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the 
JOS.13.9	From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;
JOS.13.10	And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;
JOS.13.11	And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salecah;
JOS.13.12	All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out.
JOS.13.13	Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.
JOS.13.14	Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the 
JOS.13.15	And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.
JOS.13.16	And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;
JOS.13.17	Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth–baal, and Beth–baal–meon,
JOS.13.18	And Jahzah, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
JOS.13.19	And Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth–shahar in the mount of the valley,
JOS.13.20	And Beth–peor, and Ashdoth–pisgah, and Beth–jeshimoth,
JOS.13.21	And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.
JOS.13.22	Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.
JOS.13.23	And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
JOS.13.24	And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the children of Gad according to their families.
JOS.13.25	And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;
JOS.13.26	And from Heshbon unto Ramath–mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;
JOS.13.27	And in the valley, Beth–haram, and Beth–nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.
JOS.13.28	This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.
JOS.13.29	And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.
JOS.13.30	And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:
JOS.13.31	And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.
JOS.13.32	These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.
JOS.13.33	But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the 
JOS.14.1	And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.
JOS.14.2	By lot was their inheritance, as the 
JOS.14.3	For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.
JOS.14.4	For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.
JOS.14.5	As the 
JOS.14.6	Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the 
JOS.14.7	Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the 
JOS.14.8	Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the 
JOS.14.9	And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the 
JOS.14.10	And now, behold, the 
JOS.14.11	As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.
JOS.14.12	Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the 
JOS.14.13	And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.
JOS.14.14	Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the 
JOS.14.15	And the name of Hebron before was Kirjath–arba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.
JOS.15.1	This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.
JOS.15.2	And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:
JOS.15.3	And it went out to the south side to Maaleh–acrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh–barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:
JOS.15.4	From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.
JOS.15.5	And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:
JOS.15.6	And the border went up to Beth–hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth–arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:
JOS.15.7	And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of En–shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En–rogel:
JOS.15.8	And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:
JOS.15.9	And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjath–jearim:
JOS.15.10	And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Beth–shemesh, and passed on to Timnah:
JOS.15.11	And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.
JOS.15.12	And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.
JOS.15.13	And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the 
JOS.15.14	And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
JOS.15.15	And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath–sepher.
JOS.15.16	And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath–sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
JOS.15.17	And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
JOS.15.18	And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?
JOS.15.19	Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.
JOS.15.20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.
JOS.15.21	And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,
JOS.15.22	And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,
JOS.15.23	And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,
JOS.15.24	Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,
JOS.15.25	And Hazor Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,
JOS.15.26	Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,
JOS.15.27	And Hazar–gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth–pelet,
JOS.15.28	And Hazar–shual, and Beer–sheba, and Bizjothjah,
JOS.15.29	Baalah, and Iim, and Ezem,
JOS.15.30	And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,
JOS.15.31	And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,
JOS.15.32	And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages:
JOS.15.33	And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zorah, and Ashnah,
JOS.15.34	And Zanoah, and En–gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,
JOS.15.35	Jarmuth, and Adullam, Soco, and Azekah,
JOS.15.36	And Shaaraim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages:
JOS.15.37	Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdal–gad,
JOS.15.38	And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,
JOS.15.39	Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,
JOS.15.40	And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,
JOS.15.41	And Gederoth, Beth–dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages:
JOS.15.42	Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,
JOS.15.43	And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,
JOS.15.44	And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages:
JOS.15.45	Ekron, with her towns and her villages:
JOS.15.46	From Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their villages:
JOS.15.47	Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof:
JOS.15.48	And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,
JOS.15.49	And Dannah, and Kirjath–sannah, which is Debir,
JOS.15.50	And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,
JOS.15.51	And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages:
JOS.15.52	Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,
JOS.15.53	And Janum, and Beth–tappuah, and Aphekah,
JOS.15.54	And Humtah, and Kirjath–arba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine cities with their villages:
JOS.15.55	Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,
JOS.15.56	And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,
JOS.15.57	Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:
JOS.15.58	Halhul, Beth–zur, and Gedor,
JOS.15.59	And Maarath, and Beth–anoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages:
JOS.15.60	Kirjath–baal, which is Kirjath–jearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages:
JOS.15.61	In the wilderness, Beth–arabah, Middin, and Secacah,
JOS.15.62	And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and En–gedi; six cities with their villages.
JOS.15.63	As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.
JOS.16.1	And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Beth–el,
JOS.16.2	And goeth out from Beth–el to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth,
JOS.16.3	And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of Beth–horon the nether, and to Gezer: and the goings out thereof are at the sea.
JOS.16.4	So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
JOS.16.5	And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth–addar, unto Beth–horon the upper;
JOS.16.6	And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath–shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;
JOS.16.7	And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.
JOS.16.8	The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.
JOS.16.9	And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
JOS.16.10	And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute.
JOS.17.1	There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
JOS.17.2	There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.
JOS.17.3	But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
JOS.17.4	And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The 
JOS.17.5	And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;
JOS.17.6	Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.
JOS.17.7	And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En–tappuah.
JOS.17.8	Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;
JOS.17.9	And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:
JOS.17.10	Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.
JOS.17.11	And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth–shean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.
JOS.17.12	Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
JOS.17.13	Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out.
JOS.17.14	And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as the 
JOS.17.15	And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.
JOS.17.16	And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Beth–shean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.
JOS.17.17	And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only:
JOS.17.18	But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.
JOS.18.1	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.
JOS.18.2	And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.
JOS.18.3	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to possess the land, which the 
JOS.18.4	Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me.
JOS.18.5	And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north.
JOS.18.6	Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the 
JOS.18.7	But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the 
JOS.18.8	And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the 
JOS.18.9	And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.
JOS.18.10	And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the 
JOS.18.11	And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
JOS.18.12	And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth–aven.
JOS.18.13	And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Beth–el, southward; and the border descended to Ataroth–adar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Beth–horon.
JOS.18.14	And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Beth–horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath–baal, which is Kirjath–jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter.
JOS.18.15	And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjath–jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:
JOS.18.16	And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En–rogel,
JOS.18.17	And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En–shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,
JOS.18.18	And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah:
JOS.18.19	And the border passed along to the side of Beth–hoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast.
JOS.18.20	And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families.
JOS.18.21	Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth–hoglah, and the valley of Keziz,
JOS.18.22	And Beth–arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth–el,
JOS.18.23	And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
JOS.18.24	And Chephar–ammoni, and Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities with their villages:
JOS.18.25	Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,

JOS.19.48	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
JOS.19.49	When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:
JOS.19.50	According to the word of the 
JOS.19.51	These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the 
JOS.20.1	The 
JOS.20.2	Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses:
JOS.20.3	That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
JOS.20.4	And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
JOS.20.5	And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.
JOS.20.6	And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.
JOS.20.7	And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjath–arba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.
JOS.20.8	And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
JOS.20.9	These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.
JOS.21.1	Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;
JOS.21.2	And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The 
JOS.21.3	And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the 
JOS.21.4	And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

JOS.21.9	And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name,
JOS.21.10	Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the first lot.
JOS.21.11	And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it.
JOS.21.12	But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
JOS.21.13	Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs,
JOS.21.14	And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,
JOS.21.15	And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,
JOS.21.16	And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and Beth–shemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.
JOS.21.17	And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs,
JOS.21.18	Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities.
JOS.21.19	All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
JOS.21.20	And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
JOS.21.21	For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs,
JOS.21.22	And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Beth–horon with her suburbs; four cities.
JOS.21.23	And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her suburbs,

JOS.21.25	And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with her suburbs, and Gath–rimmon with her suburbs; two cities.
JOS.21.26	All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that remained.
JOS.21.27	And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Beesh–terah with her suburbs; two cities.
JOS.21.28	And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with her suburbs, Daberath with her suburbs,
JOS.21.29	Jarmuth with her suburbs, En–gannim with her suburbs; four cities.
JOS.21.30	And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon with her suburbs,
JOS.21.31	Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four cities.
JOS.21.32	And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammoth–dor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.
JOS.21.33	All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
JOS.21.34	And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,
JOS.21.35	Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities.
JOS.21.36	And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahzah with her suburbs,

JOS.21.39	Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all.
JOS.21.40	So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities.
JOS.21.41	All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.
JOS.21.42	These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus were all these cities.
JOS.21.43	And the 
JOS.21.44	And the 
JOS.21.45	There failed not ought of any good thing which the 
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
JOS.22.2	And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the 
JOS.22.3	Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the 
JOS.22.4	And now the 
JOS.22.5	But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the 
JOS.22.6	So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.
JOS.22.7	Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them,
JOS.22.8	And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
JOS.22.9	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the 
JOS.22.10	And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.
JOS.22.11	And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.
JOS.22.12	And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.
JOS.22.13	And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
JOS.22.14	And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.
JOS.22.15	And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,
JOS.22.16	Thus saith the whole congregation of the 
JOS.22.17	Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the 
JOS.22.18	But that ye must turn away this day from following the 
JOS.22.19	Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the 
JOS.22.20	Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
JOS.22.21	Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,
JOS.22.22	The 
JOS.22.23	That we have built us an altar to turn from following the 
JOS.22.24	And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the 
JOS.22.25	For the 
JOS.22.26	Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:
JOS.22.27	But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the 
JOS.22.28	Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the 
JOS.22.29	God forbid that we should rebel against the 
JOS.22.30	And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.
JOS.22.31	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the 
JOS.22.32	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
JOS.22.33	And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.
JOS.22.34	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the 
JOS.23.1	And it came to pass a long time after that the 
JOS.23.2	And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:
JOS.23.3	And ye have seen all that the 
JOS.23.4	Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.
JOS.23.5	And the 
JOS.23.6	Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;
JOS.23.7	That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:
JOS.23.8	But cleave unto the 
JOS.23.9	For the 
JOS.23.10	One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the 
JOS.23.11	Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the 
JOS.23.12	Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:
JOS.23.13	Know for a certainty that the 
JOS.23.14	And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the 
JOS.23.15	Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the 
JOS.23.16	When ye have transgressed the covenant of the 
JOS.24.1	And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
JOS.24.2	And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the 
JOS.24.3	And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
JOS.24.4	And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
JOS.24.5	I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.
JOS.24.6	And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.
JOS.24.7	And when they cried unto the 
JOS.24.8	And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
JOS.24.9	Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:
JOS.24.10	But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
JOS.24.11	And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.
JOS.24.12	And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
JOS.24.13	And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.
JOS.24.14	Now therefore fear the 
JOS.24.15	And if it seem evil unto you to serve the 
JOS.24.16	And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the 
JOS.24.17	For the 
JOS.24.18	And the 
JOS.24.19	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the 
JOS.24.20	If ye forsake the 
JOS.24.21	And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the 
JOS.24.22	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the 
JOS.24.23	Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the 
JOS.24.24	And the people said unto Joshua, The 
JOS.24.25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
JOS.24.26	And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the 
JOS.24.27	And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the 
JOS.24.28	So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.
JOS.24.29	And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the 
JOS.24.30	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath–serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
JOS.24.31	And Israel served the 
JOS.24.32	And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
JOS.24.33	And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.
JDG.1.1	Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the 
JDG.1.2	And the 
JDG.1.3	And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
JDG.1.4	And Judah went up; and the 
JDG.1.5	And they found Adoni–bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
JDG.1.6	But Adoni–bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
JDG.1.7	And Adoni–bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.
JDG.1.8	Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
JDG.1.9	And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.
JDG.1.10	And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath–arba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
JDG.1.11	And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath–sepher:
JDG.1.12	And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath–sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
JDG.1.13	And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
JDG.1.14	And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?
JDG.1.15	And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
JDG.1.16	And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.
JDG.1.17	And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
JDG.1.18	Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Ashkelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.
JDG.1.19	And the 
JDG.1.20	And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.
JDG.1.21	And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.
JDG.1.22	And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth–el: and the 
JDG.1.23	And the house of Joseph sent to descry Beth–el. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)
JDG.1.24	And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.
JDG.1.25	And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.
JDG.1.26	And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.
JDG.1.27	Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth–shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
JDG.1.28	And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.
JDG.1.29	Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
JDG.1.30	Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.
JDG.1.31	Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:
JDG.1.32	But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.
JDG.1.33	Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth–shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth–anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth–shemesh and of Beth–anath became tributaries unto them.
JDG.1.34	And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:
JDG.1.35	But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.
JDG.1.36	And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
JDG.2.1	And an angel of the 
JDG.2.2	And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?
JDG.2.3	Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
JDG.2.4	And it came to pass, when the angel of the 
JDG.2.5	And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the 
JDG.2.6	And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.
JDG.2.7	And the people served the 
JDG.2.8	And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the 
JDG.2.9	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath–heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.
JDG.2.10	And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the 
JDG.2.11	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the 
JDG.2.12	And they forsook the 
JDG.2.13	And they forsook the 
JDG.2.14	And the anger of the 
JDG.2.15	Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the 
JDG.2.16	Nevertheless the 
JDG.2.17	And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the 
JDG.2.18	And when the 
JDG.2.19	And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.
JDG.2.20	And the anger of the 
JDG.2.21	I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:
JDG.2.22	That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the 
JDG.2.23	Therefore the 
JDG.3.1	Now these are the nations which the 
JDG.3.2	Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;
JDG.3.3	Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal–hermon unto the entering in of Hamath.
JDG.3.4	And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the 
JDG.3.5	And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:
JDG.3.6	And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
JDG.3.7	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the 
JDG.3.8	Therefore the anger of the 
JDG.3.9	And when the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.3.10	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.3.11	And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
JDG.3.12	And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the 
JDG.3.13	And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
JDG.3.14	So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
JDG.3.15	But when the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.3.16	But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
JDG.3.17	And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.
JDG.3.18	And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.
JDG.3.19	But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
JDG.3.20	And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.
JDG.3.21	And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:
JDG.3.22	And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
JDG.3.23	Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.
JDG.3.24	When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.
JDG.3.25	And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.
JDG.3.26	And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.
JDG.3.27	And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
JDG.3.28	And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the 
JDG.3.29	And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.
JDG.3.30	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
JDG.3.31	And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.
JDG.4.1	And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the 
JDG.4.2	And the 
JDG.4.3	And the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.4.4	And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
JDG.4.5	And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth–el in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
JDG.4.6	And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh–naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the 
JDG.4.7	And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.
JDG.4.8	And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.
JDG.4.9	And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the 
JDG.4.10	And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
JDG.4.11	Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.
JDG.4.12	And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.
JDG.4.13	And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.
JDG.4.14	And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the 
JDG.4.15	And the 
JDG.4.16	But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.
JDG.4.17	Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
JDG.4.18	And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.
JDG.4.19	And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
JDG.4.20	Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.
JDG.4.21	Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.
JDG.4.22	And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.
JDG.4.23	So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
JDG.4.24	And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
JDG.5.1	Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,
JDG.5.2	Praise ye the 
JDG.5.3	Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the 
JDG.5.5	The mountains melted from before the 
JDG.5.6	In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.
JDG.5.7	The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.
JDG.5.8	They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
JDG.5.9	My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the 
JDG.5.10	Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.
JDG.5.11	They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the 
JDG.5.12	Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.
JDG.5.13	Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the 
JDG.5.14	Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.
JDG.5.15	And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.
JDG.5.16	Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
JDG.5.17	Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.
JDG.5.18	Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.
JDG.5.19	The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.
JDG.5.20	They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.
JDG.5.21	The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.
JDG.5.22	Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.
JDG.5.23	Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the 
JDG.5.24	Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
JDG.5.25	He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.
JDG.5.26	She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.
JDG.5.27	At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
JDG.5.28	The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
JDG.5.29	Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,
JDG.5.30	Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?
JDG.5.31	So let all thine enemies perish, O 
JDG.6.1	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the 
JDG.6.2	And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.
JDG.6.3	And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;
JDG.6.4	And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
JDG.6.5	For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.
JDG.6.6	And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.6.7	And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.6.8	That the 
JDG.6.9	And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land;
JDG.6.10	And I said unto you, I am the 
JDG.6.11	And there came an angel of the 
JDG.6.12	And the angel of the 
JDG.6.13	And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the 
JDG.6.14	And the 
JDG.6.15	And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.
JDG.6.16	And the 
JDG.6.17	And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.
JDG.6.18	Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.
JDG.6.19	And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.
JDG.6.20	And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
JDG.6.21	Then the angel of the 
JDG.6.22	And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the 
JDG.6.23	And the 
JDG.6.24	Then Gideon built an altar there unto the 
JDG.6.25	And it came to pass the same night, that the 
JDG.6.26	And build an altar unto the 
JDG.6.27	Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the 
JDG.6.28	And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
JDG.6.29	And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.
JDG.6.30	Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.
JDG.6.31	And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.
JDG.6.32	Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.
JDG.6.33	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.
JDG.6.34	But the Spirit of the 
JDG.6.35	And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
JDG.6.36	And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,
JDG.6.37	Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.
JDG.6.38	And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
JDG.6.39	And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
JDG.6.40	And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
JDG.7.1	Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
JDG.7.2	And the 
JDG.7.3	Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
JDG.7.4	And the 
JDG.7.5	So he brought down the people unto the water: and the 
JDG.7.6	And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
JDG.7.7	And the 
JDG.7.8	So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
JDG.7.9	And it came to pass the same night, that the 
JDG.7.10	But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:
JDG.7.11	And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.
JDG.7.12	And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.
JDG.7.13	And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.
JDG.7.14	And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.
JDG.7.15	And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the 
JDG.7.16	And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.
JDG.7.17	And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
JDG.7.18	When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the 
JDG.7.19	So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.
JDG.7.20	And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the 
JDG.7.21	And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.
JDG.7.22	And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the 
JDG.7.23	And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.
JDG.7.24	And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Beth–barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Beth–barah and Jordan.
JDG.7.25	And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.
JDG.8.1	And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.
JDG.8.2	And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi–ezer?
JDG.8.3	God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
JDG.8.4	And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.
JDG.8.5	And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
JDG.8.6	And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?
JDG.8.7	And Gideon said, Therefore when the 
JDG.8.8	And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.
JDG.8.9	And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
JDG.8.10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
JDG.8.11	And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure.
JDG.8.12	And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.
JDG.8.13	And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,
JDG.8.14	And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.
JDG.8.15	And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?
JDG.8.16	And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
JDG.8.17	And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
JDG.8.18	Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.
JDG.8.19	And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the 
JDG.8.20	And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.
JDG.8.21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.
JDG.8.22	Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.
JDG.8.23	And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the 
JDG.8.24	And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
JDG.8.25	And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.
JDG.8.26	And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.
JDG.8.27	And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.
JDG.8.28	Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.
JDG.8.29	And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
JDG.8.30	And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.
JDG.8.31	And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.
JDG.8.32	And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi–ezrites.
JDG.8.33	And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baal–berith their god.
JDG.8.34	And the children of Israel remembered not the 
JDG.8.35	Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.
JDG.9.1	And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
JDG.9.2	Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
JDG.9.3	And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.
JDG.9.4	And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal–berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.
JDG.9.5	And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
JDG.9.6	And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.
JDG.9.7	And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.
JDG.9.8	The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.
JDG.9.9	But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
JDG.9.10	And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.
JDG.9.11	But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?
JDG.9.12	Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.
JDG.9.13	And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
JDG.9.14	Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.
JDG.9.15	And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
JDG.9.16	Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;
JDG.9.17	(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
JDG.9.18	And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)
JDG.9.19	If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:
JDG.9.20	But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
JDG.9.21	And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
JDG.9.22	When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,
JDG.9.23	Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
JDG.9.24	That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren.
JDG.9.25	And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.
JDG.9.26	And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
JDG.9.27	And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
JDG.9.28	And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?
JDG.9.29	And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.
JDG.9.30	And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
JDG.9.31	And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee.
JDG.9.32	Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field:
JDG.9.33	And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
JDG.9.34	And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
JDG.9.35	And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.
JDG.9.36	And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
JDG.9.37	And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.
JDG.9.38	Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.
JDG.9.39	And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
JDG.9.40	And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.
JDG.9.41	And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
JDG.9.42	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
JDG.9.43	And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
JDG.9.44	And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.
JDG.9.45	And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
JDG.9.46	And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.
JDG.9.47	And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
JDG.9.48	And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
JDG.9.49	And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
JDG.9.50	Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
JDG.9.51	But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.
JDG.9.52	And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
JDG.9.53	And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.
JDG.9.54	Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
JDG.9.55	And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.
JDG.9.56	Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:
JDG.9.57	And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
JDG.10.1	And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.
JDG.10.2	And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
JDG.10.3	And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.
JDG.10.4	And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havoth–jair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
JDG.10.5	And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.
JDG.10.6	And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the 
JDG.10.7	And the anger of the 
JDG.10.8	And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
JDG.10.9	Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
JDG.10.10	And the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.10.11	And the 
JDG.10.12	The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.
JDG.10.13	Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.
JDG.10.14	Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
JDG.10.15	And the children of Israel said unto the 
JDG.10.16	And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the 
JDG.10.17	Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah.
JDG.10.18	And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
JDG.11.1	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.
JDG.11.2	And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.
JDG.11.3	Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.
JDG.11.4	And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
JDG.11.5	And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:
JDG.11.6	And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
JDG.11.7	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?
JDG.11.8	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
JDG.11.9	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the 
JDG.11.10	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The 
JDG.11.11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the 
JDG.11.12	And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?
JDG.11.13	And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.
JDG.11.14	And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:
JDG.11.15	And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:
JDG.11.16	But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;
JDG.11.17	Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.
JDG.11.18	Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.
JDG.11.19	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.
JDG.11.20	But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahzah, and fought against Israel.
JDG.11.21	And the 
JDG.11.22	And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.
JDG.11.23	So now the 
JDG.11.24	Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the 
JDG.11.25	And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,
JDG.11.26	While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?
JDG.11.27	Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the 
JDG.11.28	Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
JDG.11.29	Then the Spirit of the 
JDG.11.30	And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the 
JDG.11.31	Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the 
JDG.11.32	So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the 
JDG.11.33	And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
JDG.11.34	And Jephthah came to Mizpah unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
JDG.11.35	And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the 
JDG.11.36	And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the 
JDG.11.37	And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.
JDG.11.38	And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
JDG.11.39	And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,
JDG.11.40	That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
JDG.12.1	And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.
JDG.12.2	And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.
JDG.12.3	And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the 
JDG.12.4	Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.
JDG.12.5	And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;
JDG.12.6	Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.
JDG.12.7	And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
JDG.12.8	And after him Ibzan of Beth–lehem judged Israel.
JDG.12.9	And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
JDG.12.10	Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Beth–lehem.
JDG.12.11	And after him Elon, a Zebulunite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.
JDG.12.12	And Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.
JDG.12.13	And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.
JDG.12.14	And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.
JDG.12.15	And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.
JDG.13.1	And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the 
JDG.13.2	And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.
JDG.13.3	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.4	Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:
JDG.13.5	For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
JDG.13.6	Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:
JDG.13.7	But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah entreated the 
JDG.13.9	And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.
JDG.13.10	And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day.
JDG.13.11	And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.
JDG.13.12	And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?
JDG.13.13	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.14	She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.
JDG.13.15	And Manoah said unto the angel of the 
JDG.13.16	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.17	And Manoah said unto the angel of the 
JDG.13.18	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.19	So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the 
JDG.13.20	For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the 
JDG.13.21	But the angel of the 
JDG.13.22	And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
JDG.13.23	But his wife said unto him, If the 
JDG.13.24	And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the 
JDG.13.25	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.1	And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.
JDG.14.2	And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.
JDG.14.3	Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.
JDG.14.4	But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the 
JDG.14.5	Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.
JDG.14.6	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.7	And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.
JDG.14.8	And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.
JDG.14.9	And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.
JDG.14.10	So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
JDG.14.11	And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
JDG.14.12	And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:
JDG.14.13	But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.
JDG.14.14	And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.
JDG.14.15	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?
JDG.14.16	And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?
JDG.14.17	And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
JDG.14.18	And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.
JDG.14.19	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.20	But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.
JDG.15.1	But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.
JDG.15.2	And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.
JDG.15.3	And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.
JDG.15.4	And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.
JDG.15.5	And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.
JDG.15.6	Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
JDG.15.7	And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
JDG.15.8	And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.
JDG.15.9	Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
JDG.15.10	And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.
JDG.15.11	Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.
JDG.15.12	And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
JDG.15.13	And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.
JDG.15.14	And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the 
JDG.15.15	And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.
JDG.15.16	And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.
JDG.15.17	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath–lehi.
JDG.15.18	And he was sore athirst, and called on the 
JDG.15.19	But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof En–hakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.
JDG.15.20	And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
JDG.16.1	Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.
JDG.16.2	And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.
JDG.16.3	And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.
JDG.16.4	And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
JDG.16.5	And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.
JDG.16.6	And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.
JDG.16.7	And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
JDG.16.8	Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
JDG.16.9	Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.
JDG.16.10	And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.
JDG.16.11	And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
JDG.16.12	Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.
JDG.16.13	And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.
JDG.16.14	And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.
JDG.16.15	And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.
JDG.16.16	And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;
JDG.16.17	That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
JDG.16.18	And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.
JDG.16.19	And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
JDG.16.20	And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the 
JDG.16.21	But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.
JDG.16.22	Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
JDG.16.23	Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
JDG.16.24	And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.
JDG.16.25	And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.
JDG.16.26	And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.
JDG.16.27	Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.
JDG.16.28	And Samson called unto the 
JDG.16.29	And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.
JDG.16.30	And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.
JDG.16.31	Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.
JDG.17.1	And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
JDG.17.2	And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the 
JDG.17.3	And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the 
JDG.17.4	Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.
JDG.17.5	And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
JDG.17.6	In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
JDG.17.7	And there was a young man out of Beth–lehem–judah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
JDG.17.8	And the man departed out of the city from Beth–lehem–judah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
JDG.17.9	And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Beth–lehem–judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.
JDG.17.10	And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.
JDG.17.11	And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
JDG.17.12	And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
JDG.17.13	Then said Micah, Now know I that the 
JDG.18.1	In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.
JDG.18.2	And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.
JDG.18.3	When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
JDG.18.4	And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.
JDG.18.5	And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
JDG.18.6	And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the 
JDG.18.7	Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.
JDG.18.8	And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?
JDG.18.9	And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.
JDG.18.10	When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.
JDG.18.11	And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.
JDG.18.12	And they went up, and pitched in Kirjath–jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh–dan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjath–jearim.
JDG.18.13	And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.
JDG.18.14	Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
JDG.18.15	And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.
JDG.18.16	And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.
JDG.18.17	And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.
JDG.18.18	And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?
JDG.18.19	And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
JDG.18.20	And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
JDG.18.21	So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.
JDG.18.22	And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.
JDG.18.23	And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?
JDG.18.24	And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?
JDG.18.25	And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.
JDG.18.26	And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.
JDG.18.27	And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.
JDG.18.28	And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth–rehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.
JDG.18.29	And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.
JDG.18.30	And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.
JDG.18.31	And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
JDG.19.1	And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth–lehem–judah.
JDG.19.2	And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Beth–lehem–judah, and was there four whole months.
JDG.19.3	And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
JDG.19.4	And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
JDG.19.5	And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.
JDG.19.6	And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.
JDG.19.7	And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.
JDG.19.8	And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.
JDG.19.9	And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.
JDG.19.10	But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.
JDG.19.11	And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
JDG.19.12	And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.
JDG.19.13	And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
JDG.19.14	And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.
JDG.19.15	And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.
JDG.19.16	And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.
JDG.19.17	And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?
JDG.19.18	And he said unto him, We are passing from Beth–lehem–judah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Beth–lehem–judah, but I am now going to the house of the 
JDG.19.19	Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.
JDG.19.20	And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.
JDG.19.21	So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.
JDG.19.22	Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.
JDG.19.23	And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.
JDG.19.24	Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.
JDG.19.25	But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
JDG.19.26	Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.
JDG.19.27	And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold.
JDG.19.28	And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.
JDG.19.29	And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.
JDG.19.30	And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.
JDG.20.1	Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beer–sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the 
JDG.20.2	And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
JDG.20.3	(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpah.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?
JDG.20.4	And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
JDG.20.5	And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.
JDG.20.6	And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
JDG.20.7	Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.
JDG.20.8	And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.
JDG.20.9	But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it;
JDG.20.10	And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.
JDG.20.11	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
JDG.20.12	And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?
JDG.20.13	Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel:
JDG.20.14	But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
JDG.20.15	And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
JDG.20.16	Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.
JDG.20.17	And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.
JDG.20.18	And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the 
JDG.20.19	And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
JDG.20.20	And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.
JDG.20.21	And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.
JDG.20.22	And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.
JDG.20.23	(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the 
JDG.20.24	And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
JDG.20.25	And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
JDG.20.26	Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the 
JDG.20.27	And the children of Israel enquired of the 
JDG.20.28	And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the 
JDG.20.29	And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.
JDG.20.30	And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
JDG.20.31	And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
JDG.20.32	And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.
JDG.20.33	And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal–tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.
JDG.20.34	And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.
JDG.20.35	And the 
JDG.20.36	So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.
JDG.20.37	And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
JDG.20.38	Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.
JDG.20.39	And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.
JDG.20.40	But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.
JDG.20.41	And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.
JDG.20.42	Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.
JDG.20.43	Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.
JDG.20.44	And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.
JDG.20.45	And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.
JDG.20.46	So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.
JDG.20.47	But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.
JDG.20.48	And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.
JDG.21.1	Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.
JDG.21.2	And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;
JDG.21.3	And said, O 
JDG.21.4	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
JDG.21.5	And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the 
JDG.21.6	And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
JDG.21.7	How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the 
JDG.21.8	And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpah to the 
JDG.21.9	For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh–gilead there.
JDG.21.10	And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh–gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.
JDG.21.11	And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.
JDG.21.12	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh–gilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
JDG.21.13	And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.
JDG.21.14	And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh–gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.
JDG.21.15	And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the 
JDG.21.16	Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
JDG.21.17	And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.
JDG.21.18	Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.
JDG.21.19	Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the 
JDG.21.20	Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;
JDG.21.21	And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
JDG.21.22	And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.
JDG.21.23	And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.
JDG.21.24	And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
JDG.21.25	In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
RUT.1.1	Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth–lehem–judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
RUT.1.2	And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth–lehem–judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
RUT.1.3	And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
RUT.1.4	And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.
RUT.1.5	And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
RUT.1.6	Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the 
RUT.1.7	Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
RUT.1.8	And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the 
RUT.1.9	The 
RUT.1.10	And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.
RUT.1.11	And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
RUT.1.12	Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;
RUT.1.13	Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the 
RUT.1.14	And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.
RUT.1.15	And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.
RUT.1.16	And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:
RUT.1.17	Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the 
RUT.1.18	When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.
RUT.1.19	So they two went until they came to Beth–lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth–lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?
RUT.1.20	And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
RUT.1.21	I went out full, and the 
RUT.1.22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Beth–lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
RUT.2.1	And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.
RUT.2.2	And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
RUT.2.3	And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.
RUT.2.4	And, behold, Boaz came from Beth–lehem, and said unto the reapers, The 
RUT.2.5	Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?
RUT.2.6	And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
RUT.2.7	And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.
RUT.2.8	Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:
RUT.2.9	Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
RUT.2.10	Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?
RUT.2.11	And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.
RUT.2.12	The 
RUT.2.13	Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.
RUT.2.14	And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.
RUT.2.15	And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:
RUT.2.16	And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.
RUT.2.17	So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.
RUT.2.18	And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.
RUT.2.19	And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.
RUT.2.20	And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the 
RUT.2.21	And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
RUT.2.22	And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.
RUT.2.23	So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.
RUT.3.1	Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
RUT.3.2	And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.
RUT.3.3	Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
RUT.3.4	And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
RUT.3.5	And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.
RUT.3.6	And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.
RUT.3.7	And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
RUT.3.8	And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.
RUT.3.9	And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.
RUT.3.10	And he said, Blessed be thou of the 
RUT.3.11	And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.
RUT.3.12	And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.
RUT.3.13	Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the 
RUT.3.14	And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.
RUT.3.15	Also he said, Bring the veil that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.
RUT.3.16	And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
RUT.3.17	And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.
RUT.3.18	Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.
RUT.4.1	Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
RUT.4.2	And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
RUT.4.3	And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:
RUT.4.4	And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.
RUT.4.5	Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
RUT.4.6	And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.
RUT.4.7	Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel.
RUT.4.8	Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe.
RUT.4.9	And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.
RUT.4.10	Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.
RUT.4.11	And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The 
RUT.4.12	And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the 
RUT.4.13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the 
RUT.4.14	And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the 
RUT.4.15	And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.
RUT.4.16	And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.
RUT.4.17	And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
RUT.4.18	Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
RUT.4.19	And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,
RUT.4.20	And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
RUT.4.21	And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
RUT.4.22	And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
1SA.1.1	Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim–zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
1SA.1.2	And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
1SA.1.3	And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.1.4	And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
1SA.1.5	But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the 
1SA.1.6	And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the 
1SA.1.7	And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the 
1SA.1.8	Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?
1SA.1.9	So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the 
1SA.1.10	And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the 
1SA.1.11	And she vowed a vow, and said, O 
1SA.1.12	And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the 
1SA.1.13	Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
1SA.1.14	And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
1SA.1.15	And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the 
1SA.1.16	Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
1SA.1.17	Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
1SA.1.18	And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.
1SA.1.19	And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the 
1SA.1.20	Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the 
1SA.1.21	And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the 
1SA.1.22	But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the 
1SA.1.23	And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the 
1SA.1.24	And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the 
1SA.1.25	And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
1SA.1.26	And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the 
1SA.1.27	For this child I prayed; and the 
1SA.1.28	Therefore also I have lent him to the 
1SA.2.1	And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the 
1SA.2.2	There is none holy as the 
1SA.2.3	Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the 
1SA.2.4	The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
1SA.2.5	They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
1SA.2.6	The 
1SA.2.7	The 
1SA.2.8	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the 
1SA.2.9	He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
1SA.2.10	The adversaries of the 
1SA.2.11	And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the 
1SA.2.12	Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the 
1SA.2.13	And the priests' custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;
1SA.2.14	And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
1SA.2.15	Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.
1SA.2.16	And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.
1SA.2.17	Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the 
1SA.2.18	But Samuel ministered before the 
1SA.2.19	Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
1SA.2.20	And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The 
1SA.2.21	And the 
1SA.2.22	Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
1SA.2.23	And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
1SA.2.24	Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the 
1SA.2.25	If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the 
1SA.2.26	And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the 
1SA.2.27	And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
1SA.2.28	And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
1SA.2.29	Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
1SA.2.30	Wherefore the 
1SA.2.31	Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.
1SA.2.32	And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.
1SA.2.33	And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.
1SA.2.34	And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.
1SA.2.35	And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.
1SA.2.36	And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.
1SA.3.1	And the child Samuel ministered unto the 
1SA.3.2	And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;
1SA.3.3	And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the 
1SA.3.4	That the 
1SA.3.5	And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
1SA.3.6	And the 
1SA.3.7	Now Samuel did not yet know the 
1SA.3.8	And the 
1SA.3.9	Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, 
1SA.3.10	And the 
1SA.3.11	And the 
1SA.3.12	In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.
1SA.3.13	For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
1SA.3.14	And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
1SA.3.15	And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the 
1SA.3.16	Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.
1SA.3.17	And he said, What is the thing that the 
1SA.3.18	And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the 
1SA.3.19	And Samuel grew, and the 
1SA.3.20	And all Israel from Dan even to Beer–sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the 
1SA.3.21	And the 
1SA.4.1	And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben–ezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
1SA.4.2	And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
1SA.4.3	And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the 
1SA.4.4	So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.5	And when the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.6	And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the 
1SA.4.7	And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
1SA.4.8	Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
1SA.4.9	Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
1SA.4.10	And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
1SA.4.11	And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
1SA.4.12	And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
1SA.4.13	And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
1SA.4.14	And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.
1SA.4.15	Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.
1SA.4.16	And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?
1SA.4.17	And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
1SA.4.18	And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
1SA.4.19	And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.
1SA.4.20	And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.
1SA.4.21	And she named the child I–chabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.
1SA.4.22	And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.
1SA.5.1	And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben–ezer unto Ashdod.
1SA.5.2	When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
1SA.5.3	And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the 
1SA.5.4	And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the 
1SA.5.5	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.
1SA.5.6	But the hand of the 
1SA.5.7	And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
1SA.5.8	They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.
1SA.5.9	And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the 
1SA.5.10	Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.
1SA.5.11	So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
1SA.5.12	And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1SA.6.1	And the ark of the 
1SA.6.2	And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the 
1SA.6.3	And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
1SA.6.4	Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.
1SA.6.5	Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
1SA.6.6	Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
1SA.6.7	Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:
1SA.6.8	And take the ark of the 
1SA.6.9	And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth–shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.
1SA.6.10	And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:
1SA.6.11	And they laid the ark of the 
1SA.6.12	And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth–shemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth–shemesh.
1SA.6.13	And they of Beth–shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
1SA.6.14	And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth–shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the 
1SA.6.15	And the Levites took down the ark of the 
1SA.6.16	And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
1SA.6.17	And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the 
1SA.6.18	And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the 
1SA.6.19	And he smote the men of Beth–shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the 
1SA.6.20	And the men of Beth–shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy 
1SA.6.21	And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath–jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the 
1SA.7.1	And the men of Kirjath–jearim came, and fetched up the ark of the 
1SA.7.2	And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath–jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the 
1SA.7.3	And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the 
1SA.7.4	Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtoreth, and served the 
1SA.7.5	And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you unto the 
1SA.7.6	And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before the 
1SA.7.7	And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
1SA.7.8	And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the 
1SA.7.9	And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the 
1SA.7.10	And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the 
1SA.7.11	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth–car.
1SA.7.12	Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben–ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the 
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the 
1SA.7.14	And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
1SA.7.15	And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
1SA.7.16	And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth–el, and Gilgal, and Mizpah, and judged Israel in all those places.
1SA.7.17	And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the 
1SA.8.1	And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
1SA.8.2	Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beer–sheba.
1SA.8.3	And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
1SA.8.4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,
1SA.8.5	And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.
1SA.8.6	But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the 
1SA.8.7	And the 
1SA.8.8	According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.
1SA.8.9	Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
1SA.8.10	And Samuel told all the words of the 
1SA.8.11	And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.
1SA.8.12	And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.
1SA.8.13	And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
1SA.8.14	And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
1SA.8.15	And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
1SA.8.16	And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
1SA.8.17	He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.
1SA.8.18	And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the 
1SA.8.19	Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;
1SA.8.20	That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
1SA.8.21	And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the 
1SA.8.22	And the 
1SA.9.1	Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.
1SA.9.2	And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.
1SA.9.3	And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.
1SA.9.4	And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.
1SA.9.5	And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.
1SA.9.6	And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.
1SA.9.7	Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?
1SA.9.8	And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
1SA.9.9	(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)
1SA.9.10	Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.
1SA.9.11	And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?
1SA.9.12	And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:
1SA.9.13	As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.
1SA.9.14	And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.
1SA.9.15	Now the 
1SA.9.16	To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.
1SA.9.17	And when Samuel saw Saul, the 
1SA.9.18	Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.
1SA.9.19	And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.
1SA.9.20	And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?
1SA.9.21	And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?
1SA.9.22	And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.
1SA.9.23	And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.
1SA.9.24	And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
1SA.9.25	And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.
1SA.9.26	And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
1SA.9.27	And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.
1SA.10.1	Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the 
1SA.10.2	When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
1SA.10.3	Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Beth–el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
1SA.10.4	And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.
1SA.10.5	After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:
1SA.10.6	And the Spirit of the 
1SA.10.7	And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.
1SA.10.8	And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.
1SA.10.9	And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.
1SA.10.10	And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
1SA.10.11	And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
1SA.10.12	And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
1SA.10.13	And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
1SA.10.14	And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.
1SA.10.15	And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.
1SA.10.16	And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
1SA.10.17	And Samuel called the people together unto the 
1SA.10.18	And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the 
1SA.10.19	And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the 
1SA.10.20	And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
1SA.10.21	When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.
1SA.10.22	Therefore they enquired of the 
1SA.10.23	And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
1SA.10.24	And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the 
1SA.10.25	Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the 
1SA.10.26	And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
1SA.10.27	But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.
1SA.11.1	Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh–gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
1SA.11.2	And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
1SA.11.3	And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.
1SA.11.4	Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.
1SA.11.5	And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
1SA.11.6	And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.
1SA.11.7	And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the 
1SA.11.8	And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
1SA.11.9	And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh–gilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
1SA.11.10	Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.
1SA.11.11	And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.
1SA.11.12	And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
1SA.11.13	And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the 
1SA.11.14	Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
1SA.11.15	And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the 
1SA.12.1	And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.
1SA.12.2	And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.
1SA.12.3	Behold, here I am: witness against me before the 
1SA.12.4	And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.
1SA.12.5	And he said unto them, The 
1SA.12.6	And Samuel said unto the people, It is the 
1SA.12.7	Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the 
1SA.12.8	When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the 
1SA.12.9	And when they forgat the 
1SA.12.10	And they cried unto the 
1SA.12.11	And the 
1SA.12.12	And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the 
1SA.12.13	Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the 
1SA.12.14	If ye will fear the 
1SA.12.15	But if ye will not obey the voice of the 
1SA.12.16	Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the 
1SA.12.17	Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the 
1SA.12.18	So Samuel called unto the 
1SA.12.19	And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the 
1SA.12.20	And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the 
1SA.12.21	And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.
1SA.12.22	For the 
1SA.12.23	Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the 
1SA.12.24	Only fear the 
1SA.12.25	But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.
1SA.13.1	Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
1SA.13.2	Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Beth–el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
1SA.13.3	And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
1SA.13.4	And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
1SA.13.5	And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth–aven.
1SA.13.6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
1SA.13.7	And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
1SA.13.8	And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
1SA.13.9	And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.
1SA.13.10	And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
1SA.13.11	And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
1SA.13.12	Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the 
1SA.13.13	And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the 
1SA.13.14	But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the 
1SA.13.15	And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.
1SA.13.16	And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
1SA.13.17	And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:
1SA.13.18	And another company turned the way to Beth–horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
1SA.13.19	Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:
1SA.13.20	But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
1SA.13.21	Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
1SA.13.22	So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
1SA.13.23	And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
1SA.14.1	Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.
1SA.14.2	And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
1SA.14.3	And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I–chabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the 
1SA.14.4	And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
1SA.14.5	The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
1SA.14.6	And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the 
1SA.14.7	And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.
1SA.14.8	Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.
1SA.14.9	If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.
1SA.14.10	But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the 
1SA.14.11	And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
1SA.14.12	And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the 
1SA.14.13	And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.
1SA.14.14	And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.
1SA.14.15	And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.
1SA.14.16	And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.
1SA.14.17	Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.
1SA.14.18	And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
1SA.14.19	And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.
1SA.14.20	And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.
1SA.14.21	Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
1SA.14.22	Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
1SA.14.23	So the 
1SA.14.24	And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.
1SA.14.25	And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
1SA.14.26	And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.
1SA.14.27	But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
1SA.14.28	Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.
1SA.14.29	Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
1SA.14.30	How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
1SA.14.31	And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.
1SA.14.32	And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.
1SA.14.33	Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the 
1SA.14.34	And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the 
1SA.14.35	And Saul built an altar unto the 
1SA.14.36	And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.
1SA.14.37	And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.
1SA.14.38	And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.
1SA.14.39	For, as the 
1SA.14.40	Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.
1SA.14.41	Therefore Saul said unto the 
1SA.14.42	And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
1SA.14.43	Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.
1SA.14.44	And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
1SA.14.45	And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the 
1SA.14.46	Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
1SA.14.47	So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.
1SA.14.48	And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
1SA.14.49	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Malchi–shua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
1SA.14.50	And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
1SA.14.51	And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
1SA.14.52	And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.
1SA.15.1	Samuel also said unto Saul, The 
1SA.15.2	Thus saith the 
1SA.15.3	Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
1SA.15.4	And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
1SA.15.5	And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
1SA.15.6	And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
1SA.15.7	And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.
1SA.15.8	And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
1SA.15.9	But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
1SA.15.10	Then came the word of the 
1SA.15.11	It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the 
1SA.15.12	And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
1SA.15.13	And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the 
1SA.15.14	And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
1SA.15.15	And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.15.16	Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the 
1SA.15.17	And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the 
1SA.15.18	And the 
1SA.15.19	Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the 
1SA.15.20	And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the 
1SA.15.21	But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.15.22	And Samuel said, Hath the 
1SA.15.23	For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.24	And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the 
1SA.15.25	Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the 
1SA.15.26	And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.27	And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
1SA.15.28	And Samuel said unto him, The 
1SA.15.29	And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.
1SA.15.30	Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the 
1SA.15.31	So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the 
1SA.15.32	Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
1SA.15.33	And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the 
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
1SA.15.35	And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the 
1SA.16.1	And the 
1SA.16.2	And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the 
1SA.16.3	And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.
1SA.16.4	And Samuel did that which the 
1SA.16.5	And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.16.6	And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the 
1SA.16.7	But the 
1SA.16.8	Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the 
1SA.16.9	Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the 
1SA.16.10	Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The 
1SA.16.11	And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.
1SA.16.12	And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the 
1SA.16.13	Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.14	But the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.15	And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
1SA.16.16	Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
1SA.16.17	And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
1SA.16.18	Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth–lehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the 
1SA.16.19	Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.
1SA.16.20	And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.
1SA.16.21	And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.
1SA.16.22	And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.
1SA.16.23	And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
1SA.17.1	Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Soco, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Soco and Azekah, in Ephes–dammim.
1SA.17.2	And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
1SA.17.3	And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
1SA.17.4	And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
1SA.17.5	And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
1SA.17.6	And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.
1SA.17.7	And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.
1SA.17.8	And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.
1SA.17.9	If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.
1SA.17.10	And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
1SA.17.11	When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
1SA.17.12	Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth–lehem–judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.
1SA.17.13	And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
1SA.17.14	And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
1SA.17.15	But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Beth–lehem.
1SA.17.16	And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
1SA.17.17	And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;
1SA.17.18	And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.
1SA.17.19	Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
1SA.17.20	And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.
1SA.17.21	For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.
1SA.17.22	And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.
1SA.17.23	And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.
1SA.17.24	And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.
1SA.17.25	And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
1SA.17.26	And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
1SA.17.27	And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.
1SA.17.28	And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.
1SA.17.29	And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
1SA.17.30	And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.
1SA.17.31	And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.
1SA.17.32	And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
1SA.17.33	And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
1SA.17.34	And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:
1SA.17.35	And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
1SA.17.36	Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.
1SA.17.37	David said moreover, The 
1SA.17.38	And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
1SA.17.39	And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.
1SA.17.40	And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.
1SA.17.41	And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.
1SA.17.42	And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.
1SA.17.43	And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
1SA.17.44	And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
1SA.17.45	Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the 
1SA.17.46	This day will the 
1SA.17.47	And all this assembly shall know that the 
1SA.17.48	And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
1SA.17.49	And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.
1SA.17.50	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.
1SA.17.51	Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
1SA.17.52	And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
1SA.17.53	And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.
1SA.17.54	And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.
1SA.17.55	And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
1SA.17.56	And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.
1SA.17.57	And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
1SA.17.58	And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth–lehemite.
1SA.18.1	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
1SA.18.2	And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.
1SA.18.3	Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
1SA.18.4	And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
1SA.18.5	And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
1SA.18.6	And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.
1SA.18.7	And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
1SA.18.8	And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
1SA.18.9	And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
1SA.18.10	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.
1SA.18.11	And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
1SA.18.12	And Saul was afraid of David, because the 
1SA.18.13	Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
1SA.18.14	And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the 
1SA.18.15	Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
1SA.18.16	But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
1SA.18.17	And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the 
1SA.18.18	And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?
1SA.18.19	But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
1SA.18.20	And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
1SA.18.21	And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.
1SA.18.22	And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.
1SA.18.23	And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
1SA.18.24	And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.
1SA.18.25	And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
1SA.18.26	And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.
1SA.18.27	Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.
1SA.18.28	And Saul saw and knew that the 
1SA.18.29	And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.
1SA.18.30	Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.
1SA.19.1	And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.
1SA.19.2	But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:
1SA.19.3	And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.
1SA.19.4	And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:
1SA.19.5	For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the 
1SA.19.6	And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the 
1SA.19.7	And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.
1SA.19.8	And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.
1SA.19.9	And the evil spirit from the 
1SA.19.10	And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
1SA.19.11	Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.
1SA.19.12	So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.
1SA.19.13	And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.
1SA.19.14	And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
1SA.19.15	And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
1SA.19.16	And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.
1SA.19.17	And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?
1SA.19.18	So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
1SA.19.19	And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
1SA.19.20	And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
1SA.19.21	And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.
1SA.19.22	Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.
1SA.19.23	And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
1SA.19.24	And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?
1SA.20.1	And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?
1SA.20.2	And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.
1SA.20.3	And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the 
1SA.20.4	Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.
1SA.20.5	And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.
1SA.20.6	If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth–lehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
1SA.20.7	If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.
1SA.20.8	Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the 
1SA.20.9	And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?
1SA.20.10	Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?
1SA.20.11	And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
1SA.20.12	And Jonathan said unto David, O 
1SA.20.13	The 
1SA.20.14	And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the 
1SA.20.15	But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the 
1SA.20.16	So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the 
1SA.20.17	And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.
1SA.20.19	And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
1SA.20.20	And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.
1SA.20.21	And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the 
1SA.20.22	But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the 
1SA.20.23	And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the 
1SA.20.24	So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.
1SA.20.25	And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.
1SA.20.26	Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.
1SA.20.27	And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?
1SA.20.28	And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth–lehem:
1SA.20.29	And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.
1SA.20.30	Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?
1SA.20.31	For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.
1SA.20.32	And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?
1SA.20.33	And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.
1SA.20.34	So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
1SA.20.35	And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
1SA.20.36	And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
1SA.20.37	And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?
1SA.20.38	And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
1SA.20.39	But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
1SA.20.40	And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.
1SA.20.41	And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
1SA.20.42	And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the 
1SA.21.1	Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?
1SA.21.2	And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.
1SA.21.3	Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.
1SA.21.4	And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
1SA.21.5	And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
1SA.21.6	So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the 
1SA.21.7	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the 
1SA.21.8	And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.
1SA.21.9	And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.
1SA.21.10	And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
1SA.21.11	And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
1SA.21.12	And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
1SA.21.13	And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
1SA.21.14	Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?
1SA.21.15	Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?
1SA.22.1	David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.
1SA.22.2	And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.
1SA.22.3	And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.
1SA.22.4	And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.
1SA.22.5	And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
1SA.22.6	When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)
1SA.22.7	Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;
1SA.22.8	That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
1SA.22.9	Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
1SA.22.10	And he enquired of the 
1SA.22.11	Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
1SA.22.12	And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
1SA.22.13	And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
1SA.22.14	Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?
1SA.22.15	Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
1SA.22.16	And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
1SA.22.17	And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the 
1SA.22.18	And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.
1SA.22.19	And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
1SA.22.20	And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
1SA.22.21	And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the 
1SA.22.22	And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.
1SA.22.23	Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.
1SA.23.1	Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.
1SA.23.2	Therefore David enquired of the 
1SA.23.3	And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
1SA.23.4	Then David enquired of the 
1SA.23.5	So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
1SA.23.6	And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
1SA.23.7	And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
1SA.23.8	And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
1SA.23.9	And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
1SA.23.10	Then said David, O 
1SA.23.11	Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O 
1SA.23.12	Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the 
1SA.23.13	Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.
1SA.23.14	And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
1SA.23.15	And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.
1SA.23.16	And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
1SA.23.17	And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
1SA.23.18	And they two made a covenant before the 
1SA.23.19	Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?
1SA.23.20	Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.
1SA.23.21	And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the 
1SA.23.22	Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly.
1SA.23.23	See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
1SA.23.24	And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.
1SA.23.25	Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
1SA.23.26	And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.
1SA.23.27	But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.
1SA.23.28	Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela–hammahlekoth.
1SA.23.29	And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En–gedi.
1SA.24.1	And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En–gedi.
1SA.24.2	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
1SA.24.3	And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.
1SA.24.4	And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the 
1SA.24.5	And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
1SA.24.6	And he said unto his men, The 
1SA.24.7	So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
1SA.24.8	David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
1SA.24.9	And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
1SA.24.10	Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the 
1SA.24.11	Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.
1SA.24.12	The 
1SA.24.13	As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.
1SA.24.14	After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.
1SA.24.15	The 
1SA.24.16	And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
1SA.24.17	And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.
1SA.24.18	And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the 
1SA.24.19	For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the 
1SA.24.20	And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.
1SA.24.21	Swear now therefore unto me by the 
1SA.24.22	And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.
1SA.25.1	And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
1SA.25.2	And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
1SA.25.3	Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.
1SA.25.4	And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.
1SA.25.5	And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
1SA.25.6	And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.
1SA.25.7	And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.
1SA.25.8	Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.
1SA.25.9	And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
1SA.25.10	And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.
1SA.25.11	Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?
1SA.25.12	So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.
1SA.25.13	And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.
1SA.25.14	But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.
1SA.25.15	But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:
1SA.25.16	They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
1SA.25.17	Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.
1SA.25.18	Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.
1SA.25.19	And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
1SA.25.20	And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.
1SA.25.21	Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.
1SA.25.22	So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.
1SA.25.23	And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
1SA.25.24	And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.
1SA.25.25	Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
1SA.25.26	Now therefore, my lord, as the 
1SA.25.27	And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.
1SA.25.28	I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the 
1SA.25.29	Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the 
1SA.25.30	And it shall come to pass, when the 
1SA.25.31	That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the 
1SA.25.32	And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the 
1SA.25.33	And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.
1SA.25.34	For in very deed, as the 
1SA.25.35	So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
1SA.25.36	And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
1SA.25.37	But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
1SA.25.38	And it came to pass about ten days after, that the 
1SA.25.39	And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the 
1SA.25.40	And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.
1SA.25.41	And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
1SA.25.42	And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
1SA.25.43	David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.
1SA.25.44	But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.
1SA.26.1	And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?
1SA.26.2	Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
1SA.26.3	And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
1SA.26.4	David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.
1SA.26.5	And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.
1SA.26.6	Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
1SA.26.7	So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.
1SA.26.8	Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.
1SA.26.9	And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the 
1SA.26.10	David said furthermore, As the 
1SA.26.11	The 
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the 
1SA.26.13	Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:
1SA.26.14	And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?
1SA.26.15	And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.
1SA.26.16	This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the 
1SA.26.17	And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
1SA.26.18	And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?
1SA.26.19	Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the 
1SA.26.20	Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the 
1SA.26.21	Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
1SA.26.22	And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.
1SA.26.23	The 
1SA.26.24	And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the 
1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
1SA.27.1	And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.
1SA.27.2	And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
1SA.27.3	And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
1SA.27.4	And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
1SA.27.5	And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
1SA.27.6	Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
1SA.27.7	And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
1SA.27.8	And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.
1SA.27.9	And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.
1SA.27.10	And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
1SA.27.11	And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.
1SA.27.12	And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
1SA.28.1	And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.
1SA.28.2	And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.
1SA.28.3	Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
1SA.28.4	And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.
1SA.28.5	And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.
1SA.28.6	And when Saul enquired of the 
1SA.28.7	Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.
1SA.28.8	And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.
1SA.28.9	And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
1SA.28.10	And Saul sware to her by the 
1SA.28.11	Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
1SA.28.12	And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.
1SA.28.13	And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.
1SA.28.14	And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.
1SA.28.15	And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.
1SA.28.16	Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the 
1SA.28.17	And the 
1SA.28.18	Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the 
1SA.28.19	Moreover the 
1SA.28.20	Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
1SA.28.21	And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.
1SA.28.22	Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
1SA.28.23	But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
1SA.28.24	And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:
1SA.28.25	And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.
1SA.29.1	Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.
1SA.29.2	And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.
1SA.29.3	Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?
1SA.29.4	And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?
1SA.29.5	Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
1SA.29.6	Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the 
1SA.29.7	Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
1SA.29.8	And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
1SA.29.9	And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
1SA.29.10	Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.
1SA.29.11	So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
1SA.30.1	And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;
1SA.30.2	And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.
1SA.30.3	So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.
1SA.30.4	Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
1SA.30.5	And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
1SA.30.6	And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the 
1SA.30.7	And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
1SA.30.8	And David enquired at the 
1SA.30.9	So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.
1SA.30.10	But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
1SA.30.11	And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;
1SA.30.12	And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.
1SA.30.13	And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.
1SA.30.14	We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
1SA.30.15	And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.
1SA.30.16	And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
1SA.30.17	And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.
1SA.30.18	And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.
1SA.30.19	And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.
1SA.30.20	And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.
1SA.30.21	And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
1SA.30.22	Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.
1SA.30.23	Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the 
1SA.30.24	For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.
1SA.30.25	And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.
1SA.30.26	And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the 
1SA.30.27	To them which were in Beth–el, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,
1SA.30.28	And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,
1SA.30.29	And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,
1SA.30.30	And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Bor–ashan, and to them which were in Athach,
1SA.30.31	And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.
1SA.31.1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
1SA.31.2	And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi–shua, Saul's sons.
1SA.31.3	And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.
1SA.31.4	Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
1SA.31.5	And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.
1SA.31.6	So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.
1SA.31.7	And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
1SA.31.8	And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
1SA.31.9	And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.
1SA.31.10	And they put his armour in the house of Ashtoreth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth–shan.
1SA.31.11	And when the inhabitants of Jabesh–gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;
1SA.31.12	All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth–shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
1SA.31.13	And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
2SA.1.1	Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
2SA.1.2	It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
2SA.1.3	And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
2SA.1.4	And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
2SA.1.5	And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
2SA.1.6	And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
2SA.1.7	And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.
2SA.1.8	And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
2SA.1.9	He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.
2SA.1.10	So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.
2SA.1.11	Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
2SA.1.12	And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the 
2SA.1.13	And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
2SA.1.14	And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the 
2SA.1.15	And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
2SA.1.16	And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the 
2SA.1.17	And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
2SA.1.18	(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)
2SA.1.19	The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
2SA.1.20	Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
2SA.1.21	Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.
2SA.1.22	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
2SA.1.23	Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
2SA.1.25	How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.
2SA.1.26	I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
2SA.1.27	How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
2SA.2.1	And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the 
2SA.2.2	So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.
2SA.2.3	And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
2SA.2.4	And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabesh–gilead were they that buried Saul.
2SA.2.5	And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh–gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the 
2SA.2.6	And now the 
2SA.2.7	Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
2SA.2.8	But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ish–bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
2SA.2.9	And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
2SA.2.10	Ish–bosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
2SA.2.11	And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2SA.2.12	And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish–bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
2SA.2.13	And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
2SA.2.14	And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
2SA.2.15	Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ish–bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
2SA.2.16	And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath–hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
2SA.2.17	And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
2SA.2.18	And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.
2SA.2.19	And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
2SA.2.20	Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.
2SA.2.21	And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.
2SA.2.22	And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
2SA.2.23	Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
2SA.2.24	Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
2SA.2.25	And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.
2SA.2.26	Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?
2SA.2.27	And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.
2SA.2.28	So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
2SA.2.29	And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.
2SA.2.30	And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.
2SA.2.31	But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.
2SA.2.32	And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth–lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.
2SA.3.1	Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.
2SA.3.2	And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
2SA.3.3	And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
2SA.3.4	And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
2SA.3.5	And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
2SA.3.6	And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.
2SA.3.7	And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish–bosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?
2SA.3.8	Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish–bosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?
2SA.3.9	So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the 
2SA.3.10	To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer–sheba.
2SA.3.11	And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
2SA.3.12	And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.
2SA.3.13	And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
2SA.3.14	And David sent messengers to Ish–bosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
2SA.3.15	And Ish–bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.
2SA.3.16	And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.
2SA.3.17	And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:
2SA.3.18	Now then do it: for the 
2SA.3.19	And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
2SA.3.20	So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.
2SA.3.21	And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
2SA.3.22	And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.
2SA.3.23	When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
2SA.3.24	Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?
2SA.3.25	Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.
2SA.3.26	And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.
2SA.3.27	And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
2SA.3.28	And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the 
2SA.3.29	Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.
2SA.3.30	So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
2SA.3.31	And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.
2SA.3.32	And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
2SA.3.33	And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?
2SA.3.34	Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.
2SA.3.35	And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.
2SA.3.36	And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.
2SA.3.37	For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
2SA.3.38	And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
2SA.3.39	And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the 
2SA.4.1	And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
2SA.4.2	And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:
2SA.4.3	And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)
2SA.4.4	And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
2SA.4.5	And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish–bosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.
2SA.4.6	And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
2SA.4.7	For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.
2SA.4.8	And they brought the head of Ish–bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ish–bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the 
2SA.4.9	And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the 
2SA.4.10	When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:
2SA.4.11	How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
2SA.4.12	And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish–bosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.
2SA.5.1	Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
2SA.5.2	Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the 
2SA.5.3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the 
2SA.5.4	David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
2SA.5.5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
2SA.5.6	And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.
2SA.5.7	Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.
2SA.5.8	And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
2SA.5.9	So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.
2SA.5.10	And David went on, and grew great, and the 
2SA.5.11	And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.
2SA.5.12	And David perceived that the 
2SA.5.13	And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
2SA.5.14	And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
2SA.5.15	Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
2SA.5.16	And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.17	But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.
2SA.5.18	The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
2SA.5.19	And David enquired of the 
2SA.5.20	And David came to Baal–perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The 
2SA.5.21	And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.
2SA.5.22	And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
2SA.5.23	And when David enquired of the 
2SA.5.24	And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the 
2SA.5.25	And David did so, as the 
2SA.6.1	Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
2SA.6.2	And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the 
2SA.6.3	And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzza and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.
2SA.6.4	And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.
2SA.6.5	And David and all the house of Israel played before the 
2SA.6.6	And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzza put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.
2SA.6.7	And the anger of the 
2SA.6.8	And David was displeased, because the 
2SA.6.9	And David was afraid of the 
2SA.6.10	So David would not remove the ark of the 
2SA.6.11	And the ark of the 
2SA.6.12	And it was told king David, saying, The 
2SA.6.13	And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the 
2SA.6.14	And David danced before the 
2SA.6.15	So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the 
2SA.6.16	And as the ark of the 
2SA.6.17	And they brought in the ark of the 
2SA.6.18	And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
2SA.6.19	And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.
2SA.6.20	Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
2SA.6.21	And David said unto Michal, It was before the 
2SA.6.22	And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.
2SA.6.23	Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.
2SA.7.1	And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the 
2SA.7.2	That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.
2SA.7.3	And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the 
2SA.7.4	And it came to pass that night, that the word of the 
2SA.7.5	Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the 
2SA.7.6	Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
2SA.7.7	In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?
2SA.7.8	Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the 
2SA.7.9	And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.
2SA.7.10	Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,
2SA.7.11	And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the 
2SA.7.12	And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
2SA.7.13	He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
2SA.7.14	I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:
2SA.7.15	But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.
2SA.7.16	And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
2SA.7.17	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
2SA.7.18	Then went king David in, and sat before the 
2SA.7.19	And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord 
2SA.7.20	And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord 
2SA.7.21	For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.
2SA.7.22	Wherefore thou art great, O 
2SA.7.23	And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?
2SA.7.24	For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, 
2SA.7.25	And now, O 
2SA.7.26	And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The 
2SA.7.27	For thou, O 
2SA.7.28	And now, O Lord 
2SA.7.29	Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord 
2SA.8.1	And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Metheg–ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.
2SA.8.2	And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.
2SA.8.3	David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.
2SA.8.4	And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.
2SA.8.5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
2SA.8.6	Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the 
2SA.8.7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
2SA.8.8	And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
2SA.8.9	When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,
2SA.8.10	Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:
2SA.8.11	Which also king David did dedicate unto the 
2SA.8.12	Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
2SA.8.13	And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.
2SA.8.14	And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the 
2SA.8.15	And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.
2SA.8.16	And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
2SA.8.17	And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;
2SA.8.18	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.
2SA.9.1	And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?
2SA.9.2	And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.
2SA.9.3	And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.
2SA.9.4	And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo–debar.
2SA.9.5	Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo–debar.
2SA.9.6	Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!
2SA.9.7	And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
2SA.9.8	And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?
2SA.9.9	Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.
2SA.9.10	Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
2SA.9.11	Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.
2SA.9.12	And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.
2SA.9.13	So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.
2SA.10.1	And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
2SA.10.2	Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
2SA.10.3	And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
2SA.10.4	Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
2SA.10.5	When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
2SA.10.6	And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth–rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ish–tob twelve thousand men.
2SA.10.7	And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
2SA.10.8	And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah, and of Rehob, and Ish–tob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.
2SA.10.9	When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:
2SA.10.10	And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.
2SA.10.11	And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
2SA.10.12	Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the 
2SA.10.13	And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
2SA.10.14	And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
2SA.10.15	And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
2SA.10.16	And Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadadezer went before them.
2SA.10.17	And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
2SA.10.18	And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.
2SA.10.19	And when all the kings that were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
2SA.11.1	And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.
2SA.11.2	And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
2SA.11.3	And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath–sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
2SA.11.4	And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.
2SA.11.5	And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
2SA.11.6	And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
2SA.11.7	And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.
2SA.11.8	And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.
2SA.11.9	But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
2SA.11.10	And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?
2SA.11.11	And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
2SA.11.12	And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.
2SA.11.13	And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
2SA.11.14	And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
2SA.11.15	And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.
2SA.11.16	And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.
2SA.11.17	And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
2SA.11.18	Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
2SA.11.19	And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,
2SA.11.20	And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
2SA.11.21	Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
2SA.11.22	So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.
2SA.11.23	And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.
2SA.11.24	And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
2SA.11.25	Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.
2SA.11.26	And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.
2SA.11.27	And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the 
2SA.12.1	And the 
2SA.12.2	The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:
2SA.12.3	But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.
2SA.12.4	And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
2SA.12.5	And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the 
2SA.12.6	And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
2SA.12.7	And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the 
2SA.12.8	And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.
2SA.12.9	Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the 
2SA.12.10	Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
2SA.12.11	Thus saith the 
2SA.12.12	For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
2SA.12.13	And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the 
2SA.12.14	Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the 
2SA.12.15	And Nathan departed unto his house. And the 
2SA.12.16	David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
2SA.12.17	And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
2SA.12.18	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?
2SA.12.19	But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
2SA.12.20	Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the 
2SA.12.21	Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
2SA.12.22	And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether 
2SA.12.23	But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
2SA.12.24	And David comforted Bath–sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the 
2SA.12.25	And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the 
2SA.12.26	And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
2SA.12.27	And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
2SA.12.28	Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
2SA.12.29	And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
2SA.12.30	And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
2SA.12.31	And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.
2SA.13.1	And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
2SA.13.2	And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.
2SA.13.3	But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.
2SA.13.4	And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
2SA.13.5	And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.
2SA.13.6	So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.
2SA.13.7	Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.
2SA.13.8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.
2SA.13.9	And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.
2SA.13.10	And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
2SA.13.11	And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.
2SA.13.12	And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.
2SA.13.13	And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.
2SA.13.14	Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.
2SA.13.16	And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.
2SA.13.17	Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
2SA.13.18	And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
2SA.13.19	And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.
2SA.13.20	And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
2SA.13.21	But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
2SA.13.22	And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
2SA.13.23	And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal–hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
2SA.13.24	And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.
2SA.13.25	And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.
2SA.13.26	Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?
2SA.13.27	But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
2SA.13.28	Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
2SA.13.29	And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.
2SA.13.30	And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
2SA.13.31	Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
2SA.13.32	And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
2SA.13.33	Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.
2SA.13.34	But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.
2SA.13.35	And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.
2SA.13.36	And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
2SA.13.37	But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.
2SA.13.38	So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
2SA.13.39	And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
2SA.14.1	Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.
2SA.14.2	And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:
2SA.14.3	And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.
2SA.14.4	And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
2SA.14.5	And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.
2SA.14.6	And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.
2SA.14.7	And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.
2SA.14.8	And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.
2SA.14.9	And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.
2SA.14.10	And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
2SA.14.11	Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the 
2SA.14.12	Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
2SA.14.13	And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.
2SA.14.14	For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.
2SA.14.15	Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
2SA.14.16	For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
2SA.14.17	Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the 
2SA.14.18	Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
2SA.14.19	And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:
2SA.14.20	To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
2SA.14.21	And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
2SA.14.22	And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.
2SA.14.23	So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
2SA.14.24	And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.
2SA.14.25	But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
2SA.14.26	And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.
2SA.14.27	And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.
2SA.14.28	So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.
2SA.14.29	Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
2SA.14.30	Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
2SA.14.31	Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?
2SA.14.32	And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.
2SA.14.33	So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.
2SA.15.1	And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
2SA.15.2	And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
2SA.15.3	And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.
2SA.15.4	Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
2SA.15.5	And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
2SA.15.6	And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
2SA.15.7	And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the 
2SA.15.8	For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the 
2SA.15.9	And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.
2SA.15.10	But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
2SA.15.11	And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.
2SA.15.12	And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
2SA.15.13	And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
2SA.15.14	And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
2SA.15.15	And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.
2SA.15.16	And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.
2SA.15.17	And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
2SA.15.18	And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
2SA.15.19	Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.
2SA.15.20	Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.
2SA.15.21	And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the 
2SA.15.22	And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.
2SA.15.23	And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
2SA.15.24	And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
2SA.15.25	And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the 
2SA.15.26	But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.
2SA.15.27	The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
2SA.15.28	See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.
2SA.15.29	Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
2SA.15.30	And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
2SA.15.31	And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O 
2SA.15.32	And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:
2SA.15.33	Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:
2SA.15.34	But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
2SA.15.35	And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
2SA.15.36	Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.
2SA.15.37	So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
2SA.16.1	And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
2SA.16.2	And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.
2SA.16.3	And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
2SA.16.4	Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.
2SA.16.5	And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.
2SA.16.6	And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
2SA.16.7	And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:
2SA.16.8	The 
2SA.16.9	Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
2SA.16.10	And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the 
2SA.16.11	And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the 
2SA.16.12	It may be that the 
2SA.16.13	And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
2SA.16.14	And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
2SA.16.15	And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
2SA.16.16	And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.
2SA.16.17	And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?
2SA.16.18	And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the 
2SA.16.19	And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.
2SA.16.20	Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.
2SA.16.21	And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.
2SA.16.22	So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
2SA.16.23	And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
2SA.17.1	Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:
2SA.17.2	And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:
2SA.17.3	And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.
2SA.17.4	And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
2SA.17.5	Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.
2SA.17.6	And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.
2SA.17.7	And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.
2SA.17.8	For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
2SA.17.9	Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.
2SA.17.10	And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.
2SA.17.11	Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beer–sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.
2SA.17.12	So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.
2SA.17.13	Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.
2SA.17.14	And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the 
2SA.17.15	Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.
2SA.17.16	Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.
2SA.17.17	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En–rogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.
2SA.17.18	Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.
2SA.17.19	And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.
2SA.17.20	And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
2SA.17.21	And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.
2SA.17.22	Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.
2SA.17.23	And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
2SA.17.24	Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
2SA.17.25	And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.
2SA.17.26	So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
2SA.17.27	And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo–debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
2SA.17.28	Brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse,
2SA.17.29	And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.
2SA.18.1	And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
2SA.18.2	And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
2SA.18.3	But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.
2SA.18.4	And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
2SA.18.5	And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
2SA.18.6	So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;
2SA.18.7	Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.
2SA.18.8	For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
2SA.18.9	And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.
2SA.18.10	And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.
2SA.18.11	And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.
2SA.18.12	And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.
2SA.18.13	Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.
2SA.18.14	Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
2SA.18.15	And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
2SA.18.16	And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.
2SA.18.17	And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.
2SA.18.18	Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.
2SA.18.19	Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the 
2SA.18.20	And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
2SA.18.21	Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.
2SA.18.22	Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?
2SA.18.23	But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.
2SA.18.24	And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.
2SA.18.25	And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.
2SA.18.26	And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.
2SA.18.27	And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.
2SA.18.28	And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the 
2SA.18.29	And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.
2SA.18.30	And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.
2SA.18.31	And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the 
2SA.18.32	And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.
2SA.18.33	And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!
2SA.19.1	And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.
2SA.19.2	And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.
2SA.19.3	And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
2SA.19.4	But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!
2SA.19.5	And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;
2SA.19.6	In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.
2SA.19.7	Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the 
2SA.19.8	Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.
2SA.19.9	And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.
2SA.19.10	And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?
2SA.19.11	And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.
2SA.19.12	Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?
2SA.19.13	And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
2SA.19.14	And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.
2SA.19.15	So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.
2SA.19.16	And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
2SA.19.17	And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.
2SA.19.18	And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;
2SA.19.19	And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.
2SA.19.20	For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
2SA.19.21	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the 
2SA.19.22	And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?
2SA.19.23	Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.
2SA.19.24	And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.
2SA.19.25	And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?
2SA.19.26	And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.
2SA.19.27	And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.
2SA.19.28	For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?
2SA.19.29	And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
2SA.19.30	And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.
2SA.19.31	And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.
2SA.19.32	Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.
2SA.19.33	And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.
2SA.19.34	And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?
2SA.19.35	I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?
2SA.19.36	Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
2SA.19.37	Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.
2SA.19.38	And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.
2SA.19.39	And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.
2SA.19.40	Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.
2SA.19.41	And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?
2SA.19.42	And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?
2SA.19.43	And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
2SA.20.1	And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.
2SA.20.2	So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
2SA.20.3	And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.
2SA.20.4	Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.
2SA.20.5	So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
2SA.20.6	And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.
2SA.20.7	And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2SA.20.8	When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.
2SA.20.9	And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.
2SA.20.10	But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2SA.20.11	And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.
2SA.20.12	And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
2SA.20.13	When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2SA.20.14	And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth–maachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.
2SA.20.15	And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth–maachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
2SA.20.16	Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.
2SA.20.17	And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.
2SA.20.18	Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.
2SA.20.19	I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the 
2SA.20.20	And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
2SA.20.21	The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
2SA.20.22	Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.
2SA.20.23	Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:
2SA.20.24	And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:
2SA.20.25	And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
2SA.20.26	And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.
2SA.21.1	Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the 
2SA.21.2	And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
2SA.21.3	Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the 
2SA.21.4	And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.
2SA.21.5	And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,
2SA.21.6	Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the 
2SA.21.7	But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the 
2SA.21.8	But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
2SA.21.9	And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the 
2SA.21.10	And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
2SA.21.11	And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
2SA.21.12	And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh–gilead, which had stolen them from the street of Beth–shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:
2SA.21.13	And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
2SA.21.14	And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.
2SA.21.15	Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.
2SA.21.16	And Ishbi–benob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.
2SA.21.17	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.
2SA.21.18	And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.
2SA.21.19	And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare–oregim, a Beth–lehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
2SA.21.20	And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
2SA.21.21	And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.
2SA.21.22	These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
2SA.22.1	And David spake unto the 
2SA.22.2	And he said, The 
2SA.22.3	The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.
2SA.22.4	I will call on the 
2SA.22.5	When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;
2SA.22.6	The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;
2SA.22.7	In my distress I called upon the 
2SA.22.8	Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.
2SA.22.9	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
2SA.22.10	He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.
2SA.22.11	And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
2SA.22.12	And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
2SA.22.13	Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
2SA.22.14	The 
2SA.22.15	And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.
2SA.22.16	And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the 
2SA.22.17	He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
2SA.22.18	He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.
2SA.22.19	They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the 
2SA.22.20	He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
2SA.22.21	The 
2SA.22.22	For I have kept the ways of the 
2SA.22.23	For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
2SA.22.24	I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.
2SA.22.25	Therefore the 
2SA.22.26	With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.
2SA.22.27	With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.
2SA.22.28	And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.
2SA.22.29	For thou art my lamp, O 
2SA.22.30	For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.
2SA.22.31	As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the 
2SA.22.32	For who is God, save the 
2SA.22.33	God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.
2SA.22.34	He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.
2SA.22.35	He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
2SA.22.36	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.
2SA.22.37	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.
2SA.22.38	I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.
2SA.22.39	And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.
2SA.22.40	For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.
2SA.22.41	Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.
2SA.22.42	They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the 
2SA.22.43	Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.
2SA.22.44	Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.
2SA.22.45	Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.
2SA.22.46	Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.
2SA.22.47	The 
2SA.22.48	It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,
2SA.22.49	And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
2SA.22.50	Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O 
2SA.22.51	He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.
2SA.23.1	Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
2SA.23.2	The Spirit of the 
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.
2SA.23.4	And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.
2SA.23.5	Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.
2SA.23.6	But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:
2SA.23.7	But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.
2SA.23.8	These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
2SA.23.9	And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:
2SA.23.10	He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the 
2SA.23.11	And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.
2SA.23.12	But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the 
2SA.23.13	And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
2SA.23.14	And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth–lehem.
2SA.23.15	And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth–lehem, which is by the gate!
2SA.23.16	And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth–lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the 
2SA.23.17	And he said, Be it far from me, O 
2SA.23.18	And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.
2SA.23.19	Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.
2SA.23.20	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:
2SA.23.21	And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
2SA.23.22	These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.
2SA.23.23	He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.
2SA.23.24	Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth–lehem,
2SA.23.25	Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
2SA.23.26	Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
2SA.23.27	Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
2SA.23.28	Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
2SA.23.29	Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
2SA.23.30	Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,
2SA.23.31	Abi–albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
2SA.23.32	Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
2SA.23.33	Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,
2SA.23.34	Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
2SA.23.35	Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
2SA.23.36	Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
2SA.23.37	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
2SA.23.38	Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,
2SA.23.39	Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.
2SA.24.1	And again the anger of the 
2SA.24.2	For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer–sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.
2SA.24.3	And Joab said unto the king, Now the 
2SA.24.4	Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
2SA.24.5	And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:
2SA.24.6	Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim–hodshi; and they came to Dan–jaan, and about to Zidon,
2SA.24.7	And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beer–sheba.
2SA.24.8	So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
2SA.24.9	And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
2SA.24.10	And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the 
2SA.24.11	For when David was up in the morning, the word of the 
2SA.24.12	Go and say unto David, Thus saith the 
2SA.24.13	So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
2SA.24.14	And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the 
2SA.24.15	So the 
2SA.24.16	And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the 
2SA.24.17	And David spake unto the 
2SA.24.18	And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the 
2SA.24.19	And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the 
2SA.24.20	And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.
2SA.24.21	And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the 
2SA.24.22	And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.
2SA.24.23	All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The 
2SA.24.24	And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the 
2SA.24.25	And David built there an altar unto the 
1KI.1.1	Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.
1KI.1.2	Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
1KI.1.3	So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
1KI.1.4	And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.
1KI.1.5	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
1KI.1.6	And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.
1KI.1.7	And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
1KI.1.9	And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En–rogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:
1KI.1.10	But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
1KI.1.11	Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath–sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?
1KI.1.12	Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
1KI.1.13	Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?
1KI.1.14	Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
1KI.1.15	And Bath–sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.
1KI.1.16	And Bath–sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?
1KI.1.17	And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the 
1KI.1.18	And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:
1KI.1.19	And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
1KI.1.20	And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
1KI.1.21	Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
1KI.1.22	And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
1KI.1.23	And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
1KI.1.24	And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
1KI.1.25	For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.
1KI.1.26	But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
1KI.1.27	Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
1KI.1.28	Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath–sheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
1KI.1.29	And the king sware, and said, As the 
1KI.1.30	Even as I sware unto thee by the 
1KI.1.31	Then Bath–sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
1KI.1.32	And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
1KI.1.33	The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
1KI.1.34	And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.
1KI.1.35	Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
1KI.1.36	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the 
1KI.1.37	As the 
1KI.1.38	So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
1KI.1.39	And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.
1KI.1.40	And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
1KI.1.41	And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
1KI.1.42	And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
1KI.1.43	And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
1KI.1.44	And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:
1KI.1.45	And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.
1KI.1.46	And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
1KI.1.47	And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
1KI.1.48	And also thus said the king, Blessed be the 
1KI.1.49	And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.
1KI.1.50	And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
1KI.1.51	And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
1KI.1.52	And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
1KI.1.53	So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.
1KI.2.1	Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
1KI.2.2	I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;
1KI.2.3	And keep the charge of the 
1KI.2.4	That the 
1KI.2.5	Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
1KI.2.6	Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.
1KI.2.7	But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
1KI.2.8	And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the 
1KI.2.9	Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.
1KI.2.10	So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
1KI.2.11	And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
1KI.2.12	Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
1KI.2.13	And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath–sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
1KI.2.14	He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.
1KI.2.15	And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the 
1KI.2.16	And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.
1KI.2.17	And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.
1KI.2.18	And Bath–sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.
1KI.2.19	Bath–sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
1KI.2.20	Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.
1KI.2.21	And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.
1KI.2.22	And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
1KI.2.23	Then king Solomon sware by the 
1KI.2.24	Now therefore, as the 
1KI.2.25	And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.
1KI.2.26	And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord 
1KI.2.27	So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the 
1KI.2.28	Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the 
1KI.2.29	And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the 
1KI.2.30	And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the 
1KI.2.31	And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.
1KI.2.32	And the 
1KI.2.33	Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the 
1KI.2.34	So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
1KI.2.35	And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
1KI.2.36	And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.
1KI.2.37	For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
1KI.2.38	And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
1KI.2.39	And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.
1KI.2.40	And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
1KI.2.41	And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
1KI.2.42	And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the 
1KI.2.43	Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the 
1KI.2.44	The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the 
1KI.2.45	And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the 
1KI.2.46	So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
1KI.3.1	And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the 
1KI.3.2	Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the 
1KI.3.3	And Solomon loved the 
1KI.3.4	And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
1KI.3.5	In Gibeon the 
1KI.3.6	And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
1KI.3.7	And now, O 
1KI.3.8	And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
1KI.3.9	Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?
1KI.3.10	And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
1KI.3.11	And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
1KI.3.12	Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
1KI.3.13	And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.
1KI.3.14	And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.
1KI.3.15	And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.3.16	Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.
1KI.3.17	And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
1KI.3.18	And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
1KI.3.19	And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
1KI.3.20	And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
1KI.3.21	And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.
1KI.3.22	And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.
1KI.3.23	Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.
1KI.3.24	And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
1KI.3.25	And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
1KI.3.26	Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.
1KI.3.27	Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.
1KI.3.28	And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.
1KI.4.1	So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
1KI.4.2	And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.
1KI.4.4	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
1KI.4.5	And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:
1KI.4.6	And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.
1KI.4.7	And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.
1KI.4.8	And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:
1KI.4.9	The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth–shemesh, and Elon–beth–hanan:
1KI.4.10	The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Soco, and all the land of Hepher:
1KI.4.11	The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
1KI.4.12	Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth–shean, which is by Zarethan beneath Jezreel, from Beth–shean to Abel–meholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokmeam:
1KI.4.13	The son of Geber, in Ramoth–gilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars:
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:
1KI.4.15	Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
1KI.4.16	Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:
1KI.4.18	Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:
1KI.4.19	Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.
1KI.4.20	Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.
1KI.4.21	And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
1KI.4.22	And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,
1KI.4.23	Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.
1KI.4.24	For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.
1KI.4.25	And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer–sheba, all the days of Solomon.
1KI.4.26	And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
1KI.4.27	And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.
1KI.4.28	Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.
1KI.4.29	And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.
1KI.4.30	And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
1KI.4.31	For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.
1KI.4.32	And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
1KI.4.33	And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.
1KI.4.34	And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.
1KI.5.1	And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
1KI.5.2	And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
1KI.5.3	Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the 
1KI.5.4	But now the 
1KI.5.5	And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the 
1KI.5.6	Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.
1KI.5.7	And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the 
1KI.5.8	And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
1KI.5.9	My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
1KI.5.10	So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.
1KI.5.11	And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
1KI.5.12	And the 
1KI.5.13	And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
1KI.5.14	And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.
1KI.5.15	And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;
1KI.5.16	Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.
1KI.5.17	And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.
1KI.5.18	And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.
1KI.6.1	And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the 
1KI.6.2	And the house which king Solomon built for the 
1KI.6.3	And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.
1KI.6.4	And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
1KI.6.5	And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:
1KI.6.6	The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
1KI.6.7	And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
1KI.6.8	The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.
1KI.6.9	So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
1KI.6.10	And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
1KI.6.11	And the word of the 
1KI.6.12	Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:
1KI.6.13	And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
1KI.6.14	So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
1KI.6.15	And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
1KI.6.16	And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.
1KI.6.17	And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.
1KI.6.18	And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
1KI.6.19	And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.6.20	And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.
1KI.6.21	So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
1KI.6.22	And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.
1KI.6.23	And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.
1KI.6.24	And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
1KI.6.25	And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.
1KI.6.26	The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.
1KI.6.27	And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
1KI.6.28	And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
1KI.6.29	And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.
1KI.6.30	And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
1KI.6.31	And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.
1KI.6.32	The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.
1KI.6.33	So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.
1KI.6.34	And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
1KI.6.35	And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.
1KI.6.36	And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.
1KI.6.37	In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the 
1KI.6.38	And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.
1KI.7.1	But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
1KI.7.2	He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
1KI.7.3	And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.
1KI.7.4	And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.
1KI.7.5	And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.
1KI.7.6	And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.
1KI.7.7	Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
1KI.7.8	And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.
1KI.7.9	All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.
1KI.7.10	And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
1KI.7.11	And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.
1KI.7.12	And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the 
1KI.7.13	And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
1KI.7.14	He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
1KI.7.15	For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.
1KI.7.16	And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:
1KI.7.17	And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.
1KI.7.18	And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.
1KI.7.19	And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.
1KI.7.20	And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.
1KI.7.21	And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.
1KI.7.22	And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
1KI.7.23	And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
1KI.7.24	And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.
1KI.7.25	It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
1KI.7.26	And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.
1KI.7.27	And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
1KI.7.28	And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:
1KI.7.29	And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.
1KI.7.30	And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.
1KI.7.31	And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.
1KI.7.32	And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
1KI.7.33	And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.
1KI.7.34	And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.
1KI.7.35	And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.
1KI.7.36	For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.
1KI.7.37	After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.
1KI.7.38	Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.
1KI.7.39	And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.
1KI.7.40	And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the 
1KI.7.41	The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;
1KI.7.42	And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;
1KI.7.43	And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
1KI.7.44	And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
1KI.7.45	And the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the 
1KI.7.46	In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
1KI.7.47	And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.
1KI.7.48	And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the 
1KI.7.49	And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,
1KI.7.50	And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.
1KI.7.51	So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the 
1KI.8.1	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.8.2	And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
1KI.8.3	And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
1KI.8.4	And they brought up the ark of the 
1KI.8.5	And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
1KI.8.6	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.8.7	For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
1KI.8.8	And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.
1KI.8.9	There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the 
1KI.8.10	And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the 
1KI.8.11	So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the 
1KI.8.12	Then spake Solomon, The 
1KI.8.13	I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.
1KI.8.14	And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)
1KI.8.15	And he said, Blessed be the 
1KI.8.16	Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
1KI.8.17	And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the 
1KI.8.18	And the 
1KI.8.19	Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.
1KI.8.20	And the 
1KI.8.21	And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the 
1KI.8.22	And Solomon stood before the altar of the 
1KI.8.23	And he said, 
1KI.8.24	Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.
1KI.8.25	Therefore now, 
1KI.8.26	And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.
1KI.8.27	But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?
1KI.8.28	Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O 
1KI.8.29	That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.
1KI.8.30	And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.
1KI.8.31	If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:
1KI.8.32	Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
1KI.8.33	When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:
1KI.8.34	Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.
1KI.8.35	When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:
1KI.8.36	Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
1KI.8.37	If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;
1KI.8.38	What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:
1KI.8.39	Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)
1KI.8.40	That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
1KI.8.41	Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;
1KI.8.42	(For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;
1KI.8.43	Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.
1KI.8.44	If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the 
1KI.8.45	Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
1KI.8.46	If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;
1KI.8.47	Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;
1KI.8.48	And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:
1KI.8.49	Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,
1KI.8.50	And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:
1KI.8.51	For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:
1KI.8.52	That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.
1KI.8.53	For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord 
1KI.8.54	And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the 
1KI.8.55	And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
1KI.8.56	Blessed be the 
1KI.8.57	The 
1KI.8.58	That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.
1KI.8.59	And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the 
1KI.8.60	That all the people of the earth may know that the 
1KI.8.61	Let your heart therefore be perfect with the 
1KI.8.62	And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the 
1KI.8.63	And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the 
1KI.8.64	The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the 
1KI.8.65	And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the 
1KI.8.66	On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the 
1KI.9.1	And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the 
1KI.9.2	That the 
1KI.9.3	And the 
1KI.9.4	And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:
1KI.9.5	Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
1KI.9.6	But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:
1KI.9.7	Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:
1KI.9.8	And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the 
1KI.9.9	And they shall answer, Because they forsook the 
1KI.9.10	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the 
1KI.9.11	(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
1KI.9.12	And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.
1KI.9.13	And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.
1KI.9.14	And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.
1KI.9.15	And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the 
1KI.9.16	For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.
1KI.9.17	And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth–horon the nether,
1KI.9.18	And Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,
1KI.9.19	And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
1KI.9.20	And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,
1KI.9.21	Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.
1KI.9.22	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.
1KI.9.23	These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.
1KI.9.24	But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.
1KI.9.25	And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the 
1KI.9.26	And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion–geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.
1KI.9.27	And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
1KI.9.28	And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
1KI.10.1	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the 
1KI.10.2	And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
1KI.10.3	And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.
1KI.10.4	And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,
1KI.10.5	And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the 
1KI.10.6	And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
1KI.10.7	Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.
1KI.10.8	Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.
1KI.10.9	Blessed be the 
1KI.10.10	And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
1KI.10.11	And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.
1KI.10.12	And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the 
1KI.10.13	And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
1KI.10.14	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,
1KI.10.15	Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
1KI.10.16	And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.
1KI.10.17	And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
1KI.10.18	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.
1KI.10.19	The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.
1KI.10.20	And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
1KI.10.21	And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
1KI.10.22	For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
1KI.10.23	So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
1KI.10.24	And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
1KI.10.25	And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
1KI.10.26	And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.
1KI.10.27	And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.
1KI.10.28	And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
1KI.10.29	And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
1KI.11.1	But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites;
1KI.11.2	Of the nations concerning which the 
1KI.11.3	And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.
1KI.11.4	For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the 
1KI.11.5	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
1KI.11.6	And Solomon did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.11.7	Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.
1KI.11.8	And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.
1KI.11.9	And the 
1KI.11.10	And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the 
1KI.11.11	Wherefore the 
1KI.11.12	Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
1KI.11.13	Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
1KI.11.14	And the 
1KI.11.15	For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;
1KI.11.16	(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)
1KI.11.17	That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.
1KI.11.18	And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
1KI.11.19	And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
1KI.11.20	And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.
1KI.11.21	And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.
1KI.11.22	Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.
1KI.11.23	And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:
1KI.11.24	And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.
1KI.11.25	And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
1KI.11.26	And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zeredah, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.
1KI.11.27	And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.
1KI.11.28	And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
1KI.11.29	And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:
1KI.11.30	And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:
1KI.11.31	And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the 
1KI.11.32	(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)
1KI.11.33	Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.
1KI.11.34	Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:
1KI.11.35	But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.
1KI.11.36	And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.
1KI.11.37	And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
1KI.11.38	And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.
1KI.11.39	And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
1KI.11.40	Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
1KI.11.41	And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
1KI.11.42	And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
1KI.11.43	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.12.1	And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.
1KI.12.2	And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)
1KI.12.3	That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,
1KI.12.4	Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
1KI.12.5	And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.
1KI.12.6	And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?
1KI.12.7	And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
1KI.12.8	But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:
1KI.12.9	And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?
1KI.12.10	And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
1KI.12.11	And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1KI.12.12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.
1KI.12.13	And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;
1KI.12.14	And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1KI.12.15	Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the 
1KI.12.16	So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.
1KI.12.17	But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
1KI.12.18	Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
1KI.12.19	So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
1KI.12.20	And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
1KI.12.21	And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
1KI.12.22	But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
1KI.12.23	Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
1KI.12.24	Thus saith the 
1KI.12.25	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.
1KI.12.26	And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:
1KI.12.27	If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the 
1KI.12.28	Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
1KI.12.29	And he set the one in Beth–el, and the other put he in Dan.
1KI.12.30	And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.
1KI.12.31	And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.
1KI.12.32	And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth–el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth–el the priests of the high places which he had made.
1KI.12.33	So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth–el the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.
1KI.13.1	And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the 
1KI.13.2	And he cried against the altar in the word of the 
1KI.13.3	And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the 
1KI.13.4	And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Beth–el, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.
1KI.13.5	The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the 
1KI.13.6	And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Entreat now the face of the 
1KI.13.7	And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.
1KI.13.8	And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:
1KI.13.9	For so was it charged me by the word of the 
1KI.13.10	So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth–el.
1KI.13.11	Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth–el; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth–el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.
1KI.13.12	And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.
1KI.13.13	And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,
1KI.13.14	And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.
1KI.13.15	Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
1KI.13.16	And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:
1KI.13.17	For it was said to me by the word of the 
1KI.13.18	He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the 
1KI.13.19	So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.
1KI.13.20	And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the 
1KI.13.21	And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the 
1KI.13.22	But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the 
1KI.13.23	And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
1KI.13.24	And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase.
1KI.13.25	And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
1KI.13.26	And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the 
1KI.13.27	And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.
1KI.13.28	And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass.
1KI.13.29	And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.
1KI.13.30	And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!
1KI.13.31	And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:
1KI.13.32	For the saying which he cried by the word of the 
1KI.13.33	After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.
1KI.13.34	And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.
1KI.14.1	At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
1KI.14.2	And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.
1KI.14.3	And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.
1KI.14.4	And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
1KI.14.5	And the 
1KI.14.6	And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.
1KI.14.7	Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the 
1KI.14.8	And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes;
1KI.14.9	But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:
1KI.14.10	Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.
1KI.14.11	Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the 
1KI.14.12	Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
1KI.14.13	And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the 
1KI.14.14	Moreover the 
1KI.14.15	For the 
1KI.14.16	And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.
1KI.14.17	And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;
1KI.14.18	And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the 
1KI.14.19	And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
1KI.14.20	And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.14.21	And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the 
1KI.14.22	And Judah did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.14.23	For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.
1KI.14.24	And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the 
1KI.14.25	And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:
1KI.14.26	And he took away the treasures of the house of the 
1KI.14.27	And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house.
1KI.14.28	And it was so, when the king went into the house of the 
1KI.14.29	Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1KI.14.30	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
1KI.14.31	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.1	Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.
1KI.15.2	Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
1KI.15.3	And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the 
1KI.15.4	Nevertheless for David's sake did the 
1KI.15.5	Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the 
1KI.15.6	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
1KI.15.7	Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
1KI.15.8	And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.9	And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.
1KI.15.10	And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
1KI.15.11	And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the 
1KI.15.12	And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
1KI.15.13	And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.
1KI.15.14	But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the 
1KI.15.15	And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the 
1KI.15.16	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1KI.15.17	And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
1KI.15.18	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the 
1KI.15.19	There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
1KI.15.20	So Ben–hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel–beth–maachah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
1KI.15.21	And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
1KI.15.22	Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
1KI.15.23	The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
1KI.15.24	And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.25	And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.
1KI.15.26	And he did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.15.27	And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.
1KI.15.28	Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.29	And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the 
1KI.15.30	Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the 
1KI.15.31	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1KI.15.32	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1KI.15.33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.
1KI.15.34	And he did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.1	Then the word of the 
1KI.16.2	Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;
1KI.16.3	Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
1KI.16.4	Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.
1KI.16.5	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1KI.16.6	So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.16.7	And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the 
1KI.16.8	In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.
1KI.16.9	And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.
1KI.16.10	And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
1KI.16.11	And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.
1KI.16.12	Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the 
1KI.16.13	For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the 
1KI.16.14	Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1KI.16.15	In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
1KI.16.16	And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
1KI.16.17	And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
1KI.16.18	And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died,
1KI.16.19	For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.20	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1KI.16.21	Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
1KI.16.22	But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
1KI.16.23	In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.
1KI.16.24	And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.
1KI.16.25	But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the 
1KI.16.26	For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the 
1KI.16.27	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1KI.16.28	So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.16.29	And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
1KI.16.30	And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.31	And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.
1KI.16.32	And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
1KI.16.33	And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the 
1KI.16.34	In his days did Hiel the Beth–elite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the 
1KI.17.1	And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the 
1KI.17.2	And the word of the 
1KI.17.3	Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.
1KI.17.4	And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
1KI.17.5	So he went and did according unto the word of the 
1KI.17.6	And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
1KI.17.7	And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
1KI.17.8	And the word of the 
1KI.17.9	Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
1KI.17.10	So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
1KI.17.11	And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.
1KI.17.12	And she said, As the 
1KI.17.13	And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.
1KI.17.14	For thus saith the 
1KI.17.15	And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.
1KI.17.16	And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the 
1KI.17.17	And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
1KI.17.18	And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
1KI.17.19	And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
1KI.17.20	And he cried unto the 
1KI.17.21	And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the 
1KI.17.22	And the 
1KI.17.23	And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
1KI.17.24	And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the 
1KI.18.1	And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the 
1KI.18.2	And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.
1KI.18.3	And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the 
1KI.18.4	For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the 
1KI.18.5	And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
1KI.18.6	So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
1KI.18.7	And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?
1KI.18.8	And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
1KI.18.9	And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?
1KI.18.10	As the 
1KI.18.11	And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
1KI.18.12	And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the 
1KI.18.13	Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the 
1KI.18.14	And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.
1KI.18.15	And Elijah said, As the 
1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
1KI.18.17	And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?
1KI.18.18	And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the 
1KI.18.19	Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.
1KI.18.20	So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
1KI.18.21	And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the 
1KI.18.22	Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the 
1KI.18.23	Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:
1KI.18.24	And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the 
1KI.18.25	And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.
1KI.18.26	And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
1KI.18.27	And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.
1KI.18.28	And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
1KI.18.29	And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
1KI.18.30	And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the 
1KI.18.31	And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the 
1KI.18.32	And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the 
1KI.18.33	And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
1KI.18.34	And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.
1KI.18.35	And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
1KI.18.36	And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, 
1KI.18.37	Hear me, O 
1KI.18.38	Then the fire of the 
1KI.18.39	And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The 
1KI.18.40	And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
1KI.18.41	And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.
1KI.18.42	So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,
1KI.18.43	And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
1KI.18.44	And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.
1KI.18.45	And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.
1KI.18.46	And the hand of the 
1KI.19.1	And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
1KI.19.2	Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.
1KI.19.3	And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer–sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.
1KI.19.4	But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O 
1KI.19.5	And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.
1KI.19.6	And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.
1KI.19.7	And the angel of the 
1KI.19.8	And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.
1KI.19.9	And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the 
1KI.19.10	And he said, I have been very zealous for the 
1KI.19.11	And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the 
1KI.19.12	And after the earthquake a fire; but the 
1KI.19.13	And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?
1KI.19.14	And he said, I have been very zealous for the 
1KI.19.15	And the 
1KI.19.16	And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel–meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.
1KI.19.17	And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
1KI.19.18	Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.
1KI.19.19	So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.
1KI.19.20	And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?
1KI.19.21	And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.
1KI.20.1	And Ben–hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.
1KI.20.2	And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben–hadad,
1KI.20.3	Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.
1KI.20.4	And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.
1KI.20.5	And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben–hadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
1KI.20.6	Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.
1KI.20.7	Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.
1KI.20.8	And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent.
1KI.20.9	Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben–hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.
1KI.20.10	And Ben–hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.
1KI.20.11	And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.
1KI.20.12	And it came to pass, when Ben–hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.
1KI.20.13	And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the 
1KI.20.14	And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the 
1KI.20.15	Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.
1KI.20.16	And they went out at noon. But Ben–hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.
1KI.20.17	And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben–hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.
1KI.20.18	And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.
1KI.20.19	So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.
1KI.20.20	And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Ben–hadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.
1KI.20.21	And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
1KI.20.22	And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
1KI.20.23	And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
1KI.20.24	And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:
1KI.20.25	And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.
1KI.20.26	And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben–hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
1KI.20.27	And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.
1KI.20.28	And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the 
1KI.20.29	And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.
1KI.20.30	But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Ben–hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
1KI.20.31	And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.
1KI.20.32	So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben–hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.
1KI.20.33	Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Ben–hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben–hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
1KI.20.34	And Ben–hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.
1KI.20.35	And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the 
1KI.20.36	Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the 
1KI.20.37	Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.
1KI.20.38	So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.
1KI.20.39	And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
1KI.20.40	And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.
1KI.20.41	And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
1KI.20.42	And he said unto him, Thus saith the 
1KI.20.43	And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.
1KI.21.1	And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
1KI.21.2	And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
1KI.21.3	And Naboth said to Ahab, The 
1KI.21.4	And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
1KI.21.5	But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?
1KI.21.6	And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.
1KI.21.7	And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
1KI.21.8	So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.
1KI.21.9	And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:
1KI.21.10	And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.
1KI.21.11	And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.
1KI.21.12	They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
1KI.21.13	And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
1KI.21.14	Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
1KI.21.15	And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
1KI.21.16	And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
1KI.21.17	And the word of the 
1KI.21.18	Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.
1KI.21.19	And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the 
1KI.21.20	And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the 
1KI.21.21	Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
1KI.21.22	And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.
1KI.21.23	And of Jezebel also spake the 
1KI.21.24	Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
1KI.21.25	But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the 
1KI.21.26	And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the 
1KI.21.27	And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
1KI.21.28	And the word of the 
1KI.21.29	Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.
1KI.22.1	And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
1KI.22.2	And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
1KI.22.3	And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?
1KI.22.4	And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth–gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
1KI.22.5	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the 
1KI.22.6	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth–gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
1KI.22.7	And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the 
1KI.22.8	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the 
1KI.22.9	Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.
1KI.22.10	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
1KI.22.11	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the 
1KI.22.12	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth–gilead, and prosper: for the 
1KI.22.13	And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.
1KI.22.14	And Micaiah said, As the 
1KI.22.15	So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth–gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the 
1KI.22.16	And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the 
1KI.22.17	And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the 
1KI.22.18	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?
1KI.22.19	And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the 
1KI.22.20	And the 
1KI.22.21	And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the 
1KI.22.22	And the 
1KI.22.23	Now therefore, behold, the 
1KI.22.24	But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the 
1KI.22.25	And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
1KI.22.26	And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
1KI.22.27	And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
1KI.22.28	And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the 
1KI.22.29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth–gilead.
1KI.22.30	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
1KI.22.31	But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
1KI.22.32	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
1KI.22.33	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
1KI.22.34	And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
1KI.22.35	And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.
1KI.22.36	And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.
1KI.22.37	So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
1KI.22.38	And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the 
1KI.22.39	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1KI.22.40	So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.22.41	And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
1KI.22.43	And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the 
1KI.22.44	And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
1KI.22.45	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1KI.22.46	And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.
1KI.22.47	There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
1KI.22.48	Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion–geber.
1KI.22.49	Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
1KI.22.50	And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.
1KI.22.52	And he did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.22.53	For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the 
2KI.1.1	Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2KI.1.2	And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baal–zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.
2KI.1.3	But the angel of the 
2KI.1.4	Now therefore thus saith the 
2KI.1.5	And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?
2KI.1.6	And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the 
2KI.1.7	And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?
2KI.1.8	And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
2KI.1.9	Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.
2KI.1.10	And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
2KI.1.11	Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.
2KI.1.12	And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
2KI.1.13	And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
2KI.1.14	Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.
2KI.1.15	And the angel of the 
2KI.1.16	And he said unto him, Thus saith the 
2KI.1.17	So he died according to the word of the 
2KI.1.18	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.2.1	And it came to pass, when the 
2KI.2.2	And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the 
2KI.2.3	And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth–el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the 
2KI.2.4	And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the 
2KI.2.5	And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the 
2KI.2.6	And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the 
2KI.2.7	And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.
2KI.2.8	And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
2KI.2.9	And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
2KI.2.10	And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.
2KI.2.11	And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
2KI.2.12	And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
2KI.2.13	He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;
2KI.2.14	And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the 
2KI.2.15	And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
2KI.2.16	And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the 
2KI.2.17	And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
2KI.2.18	And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?
2KI.2.19	And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.
2KI.2.20	And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.
2KI.2.21	And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the 
2KI.2.22	So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.
2KI.2.23	And he went up from thence unto Beth–el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.
2KI.2.24	And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the 
2KI.2.25	And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
2KI.3.2	And he wrought evil in the sight of the 
2KI.3.3	Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
2KI.3.4	And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
2KI.3.5	But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
2KI.3.6	And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.
2KI.3.7	And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.
2KI.3.8	And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.
2KI.3.10	And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the 
2KI.3.11	But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the 
2KI.3.12	And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the 
2KI.3.13	And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the 
2KI.3.14	And Elisha said, As the 
2KI.3.15	But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the 
2KI.3.16	And he said, Thus saith the 
2KI.3.17	For thus saith the 
2KI.3.18	And this is but a light thing in the sight of the 
2KI.3.19	And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
2KI.3.20	And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
2KI.3.21	And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.
2KI.3.22	And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:
2KI.3.23	And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
2KI.3.24	And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.
2KI.3.25	And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kir–hareseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.
2KI.3.26	And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.
2KI.3.27	Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.
2KI.4.1	Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the 
2KI.4.2	And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.
2KI.4.3	Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.
2KI.4.4	And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
2KI.4.5	So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.
2KI.4.6	And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
2KI.4.7	Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.
2KI.4.8	And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
2KI.4.9	And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.
2KI.4.10	Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
2KI.4.11	And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.
2KI.4.12	And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
2KI.4.13	And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.
2KI.4.14	And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.
2KI.4.15	And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.
2KI.4.16	And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.
2KI.4.17	And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.
2KI.4.18	And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
2KI.4.19	And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.
2KI.4.20	And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.
2KI.4.21	And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.
2KI.4.22	And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.
2KI.4.23	And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.
2KI.4.24	Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.
2KI.4.25	So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:
2KI.4.26	Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.
2KI.4.27	And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the 
2KI.4.28	Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?
2KI.4.29	Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.
2KI.4.30	And the mother of the child said, As the 
2KI.4.31	And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
2KI.4.32	And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.
2KI.4.33	He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the 
2KI.4.34	And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.
2KI.4.35	Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
2KI.4.36	And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.
2KI.4.37	Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.
2KI.4.38	And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.
2KI.4.39	And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.
2KI.4.40	So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.
2KI.4.41	But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.
2KI.4.42	And there came a man from Baal–shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.
2KI.4.43	And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the 
2KI.4.44	So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the 
2KI.5.1	Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the 
2KI.5.2	And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.
2KI.5.3	And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.
2KI.5.4	And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.
2KI.5.5	And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
2KI.5.6	And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.
2KI.5.7	And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.
2KI.5.8	And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
2KI.5.9	So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
2KI.5.10	And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.
2KI.5.11	But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the 
2KI.5.12	Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.
2KI.5.13	And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?
2KI.5.14	Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
2KI.5.15	And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.
2KI.5.16	But he said, As the 
2KI.5.17	And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the 
2KI.5.18	In this thing the 
2KI.5.19	And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.
2KI.5.20	But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the 
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?
2KI.5.22	And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.
2KI.5.23	And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.
2KI.5.24	And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.
2KI.5.25	But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.
2KI.5.26	And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?
2KI.5.27	The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.
2KI.6.1	And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.
2KI.6.2	Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.
2KI.6.3	And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.
2KI.6.4	So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.
2KI.6.5	But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.
2KI.6.6	And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.
2KI.6.7	Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.
2KI.6.8	Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.
2KI.6.9	And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.
2KI.6.10	And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.
2KI.6.11	Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?
2KI.6.12	And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.
2KI.6.13	And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.
2KI.6.14	Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.
2KI.6.15	And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?
2KI.6.16	And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.
2KI.6.17	And Elisha prayed, and said, 
2KI.6.18	And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the 
2KI.6.19	And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.
2KI.6.20	And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, 
2KI.6.21	And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?
2KI.6.22	And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.
2KI.6.23	And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
2KI.6.24	And it came to pass after this, that Ben–hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
2KI.6.25	And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.
2KI.6.26	And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
2KI.6.27	And he said, If the 
2KI.6.28	And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.
2KI.6.29	So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.
2KI.6.30	And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.
2KI.6.31	Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.
2KI.6.32	But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
2KI.6.33	And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the 
2KI.7.1	Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the 
2KI.7.2	Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the 
2KI.7.3	And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
2KI.7.4	If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
2KI.7.5	And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.
2KI.7.6	For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
2KI.7.7	Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.
2KI.7.8	And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.
2KI.7.9	Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.
2KI.7.10	So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.
2KI.7.11	And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.
2KI.7.12	And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.
2KI.7.13	And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.
2KI.7.14	They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
2KI.7.15	And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
2KI.7.16	And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the 
2KI.7.17	And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.
2KI.7.18	And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:
2KI.7.19	And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the 
2KI.7.20	And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.
2KI.8.1	Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the 
2KI.8.2	And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
2KI.8.3	And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.
2KI.8.4	And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.
2KI.8.5	And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.
2KI.8.6	And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.
2KI.8.7	And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben–hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.
2KI.8.8	And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the 
2KI.8.9	So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben–hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
2KI.8.10	And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the 
2KI.8.11	And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.
2KI.8.12	And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.
2KI.8.13	And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The 
2KI.8.14	So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover.
2KI.8.15	And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.
2KI.8.16	And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
2KI.8.17	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
2KI.8.18	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.8.19	Yet the 
2KI.8.20	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
2KI.8.21	So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.
2KI.8.22	Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
2KI.8.23	And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.8.24	And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.8.25	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.
2KI.8.26	Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
2KI.8.27	And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.8.28	And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth–gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
2KI.8.29	And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2KI.9.1	And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramoth–gilead:
2KI.9.2	And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;
2KI.9.3	Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the 
2KI.9.4	So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth–gilead.
2KI.9.5	And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.
2KI.9.6	And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
2KI.9.7	And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the 
2KI.9.8	For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:
2KI.9.9	And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:
2KI.9.10	And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.
2KI.9.11	Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.
2KI.9.12	And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the 
2KI.9.13	Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.
2KI.9.14	So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth–gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.
2KI.9.15	But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.
2KI.9.16	So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.
2KI.9.17	And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?
2KI.9.18	So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.
2KI.9.19	Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.
2KI.9.20	And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.
2KI.9.21	And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
2KI.9.22	And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?
2KI.9.23	And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.
2KI.9.24	And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
2KI.9.25	Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the 
2KI.9.26	Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the 
2KI.9.27	But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
2KI.9.28	And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.
2KI.9.29	And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
2KI.9.30	And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.
2KI.9.31	And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?
2KI.9.32	And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.
2KI.9.33	And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.
2KI.9.34	And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.
2KI.9.35	And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.
2KI.9.36	Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the 
2KI.9.37	And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.
2KI.10.1	And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,
2KI.10.2	Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour;
2KI.10.3	Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.
2KI.10.4	But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?
2KI.10.5	And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.
2KI.10.6	Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.
2KI.10.7	And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.
2KI.10.8	And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.
2KI.10.9	And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?
2KI.10.10	Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the 
2KI.10.11	So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
2KI.10.12	And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way,
2KI.10.13	Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.
2KI.10.14	And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.
2KI.10.15	And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
2KI.10.16	And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the 
2KI.10.17	And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the 
2KI.10.18	And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.
2KI.10.19	Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
2KI.10.20	And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.
2KI.10.21	And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.
2KI.10.22	And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.
2KI.10.23	And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the 
2KI.10.24	And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.
2KI.10.25	And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
2KI.10.26	And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.
2KI.10.27	And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.
2KI.10.28	Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
2KI.10.29	Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Beth–el, and that were in Dan.
2KI.10.30	And the 
2KI.10.31	But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the 
2KI.10.32	In those days the 
2KI.10.33	From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
2KI.10.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.10.35	And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.10.36	And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.
2KI.11.1	And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.
2KI.11.2	But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.
2KI.11.3	And he was with her hid in the house of the 
2KI.11.4	And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the 
2KI.11.5	And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;
2KI.11.6	And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.
2KI.11.7	And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the 
2KI.11.8	And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.
2KI.11.9	And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
2KI.11.10	And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the 
2KI.11.11	And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.
2KI.11.12	And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.
2KI.11.13	And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the 
2KI.11.14	And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.
2KI.11.15	But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the 
2KI.11.16	And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.
2KI.11.17	And Jehoiada made a covenant between the 
2KI.11.18	And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the 
2KI.11.19	And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the 
2KI.11.20	And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house.
2KI.11.21	Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.
2KI.12.1	In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer–sheba.
2KI.12.2	And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the 
2KI.12.3	But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
2KI.12.4	And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the 
2KI.12.5	Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.
2KI.12.6	But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
2KI.12.7	Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.
2KI.12.8	And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.
2KI.12.9	But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the 
2KI.12.10	And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the 
2KI.12.11	And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the 
2KI.12.12	And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the 
2KI.12.13	Howbeit there were not made for the house of the 
2KI.12.14	But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the 
2KI.12.15	Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.
2KI.12.16	The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the 
2KI.12.17	Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
2KI.12.18	And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the 
2KI.12.19	And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.12.20	And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.
2KI.12.21	For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.13.1	In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.
2KI.13.2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.13.3	And the anger of the 
2KI.13.4	And Jehoahaz besought the 
2KI.13.5	(And the 
2KI.13.6	Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)
2KI.13.7	Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.
2KI.13.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.13.9	And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.13.10	In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years.
2KI.13.11	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.13.12	And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.13.13	And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
2KI.13.14	Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
2KI.13.15	And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows.
2KI.13.16	And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands.
2KI.13.17	And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the 
2KI.13.18	And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.
2KI.13.19	And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.
2KI.13.20	And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
2KI.13.21	And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.
2KI.13.22	But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
2KI.13.23	And the 
2KI.13.24	So Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben–hadad his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.13.25	And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben–hadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.
2KI.14.1	In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.
2KI.14.2	He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
2KI.14.3	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2KI.14.4	Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.
2KI.14.5	And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.
2KI.14.6	But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the 
2KI.14.7	He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.
2KI.14.8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
2KI.14.9	And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.
2KI.14.10	Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
2KI.14.11	But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth–shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
2KI.14.12	And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.
2KI.14.13	And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth–shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
2KI.14.14	And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the 
2KI.14.15	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.14.16	And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.14.17	And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
2KI.14.18	And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.14.19	Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
2KI.14.20	And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
2KI.14.21	And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
2KI.14.22	He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
2KI.14.23	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.
2KI.14.24	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.14.25	He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the 
2KI.14.26	For the 
2KI.14.27	And the 
2KI.14.28	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.14.29	And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.15.1	In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.
2KI.15.2	Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
2KI.15.3	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2KI.15.4	Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.
2KI.15.5	And the 
2KI.15.6	And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.15.7	So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.15.8	In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.
2KI.15.9	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.15.10	And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
2KI.15.11	And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.12	This was the word of the 
2KI.15.13	Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.
2KI.15.14	For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
2KI.15.15	And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.16	Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.
2KI.15.17	In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria.
2KI.15.18	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.15.19	And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
2KI.15.20	And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.
2KI.15.21	And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.15.22	And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.15.23	In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years.
2KI.15.24	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.15.25	But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.
2KI.15.26	And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.27	In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years.
2KI.15.28	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.15.29	In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath–pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel–beth–maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.
2KI.15.30	And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.
2KI.15.31	And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.32	In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.
2KI.15.33	Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
2KI.15.34	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2KI.15.35	Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the 
2KI.15.36	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.15.37	In those days the 
2KI.15.38	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.16.1	In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
2KI.16.2	Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the sight of the 
2KI.16.3	But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the 
2KI.16.4	And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
2KI.16.5	Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.
2KI.16.6	At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day.
2KI.16.7	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath–pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.
2KI.16.8	And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the 
2KI.16.9	And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.
2KI.16.10	And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath–pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.
2KI.16.11	And Uriah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Uriah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus.
2KI.16.12	And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.
2KI.16.13	And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar.
2KI.16.14	And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the 
2KI.16.15	And king Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by.
2KI.16.16	Thus did Uriah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
2KI.16.17	And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones.
2KI.16.18	And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the 
2KI.16.19	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.16.20	And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.17.1	In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.
2KI.17.2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.17.3	Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.
2KI.17.4	And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
2KI.17.5	Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
2KI.17.6	In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
2KI.17.7	For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the 
2KI.17.8	And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the 
2KI.17.9	And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the 
2KI.17.10	And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:
2KI.17.11	And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the 
2KI.17.12	For they served idols, whereof the 
2KI.17.13	Yet the 
2KI.17.14	Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the 
2KI.17.15	And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the 
2KI.17.16	And they left all the commandments of the 
2KI.17.17	And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the 
2KI.17.18	Therefore the 
2KI.17.19	Also Judah kept not the commandments of the 
2KI.17.20	And the 
2KI.17.21	For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the 
2KI.17.22	For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
2KI.17.23	Until the 
2KI.17.24	And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.
2KI.17.25	And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the 
2KI.17.26	Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.
2KI.17.28	Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth–el, and taught them how they should fear the 
2KI.17.29	Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.
2KI.17.30	And the men of Babylon made Succoth–benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
2KI.17.31	And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
2KI.17.32	So they feared the 
2KI.17.33	They feared the 
2KI.17.34	Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the 
2KI.17.35	With whom the 
2KI.17.36	But the 
2KI.17.37	And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.
2KI.17.38	And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.
2KI.17.39	But the 
2KI.17.40	Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.
2KI.17.41	So these nations feared the 
2KI.18.1	Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
2KI.18.2	Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
2KI.18.3	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2KI.18.4	He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.
2KI.18.5	He trusted in the 
2KI.18.6	For he clave to the 
2KI.18.7	And the 
2KI.18.8	He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
2KI.18.9	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
2KI.18.10	And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
2KI.18.11	And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:
2KI.18.12	Because they obeyed not the voice of the 
2KI.18.13	Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.
2KI.18.14	And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
2KI.18.15	And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the 
2KI.18.16	At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the 
2KI.18.17	And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab–shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.
2KI.18.18	And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
2KI.18.19	And Rab–shakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
2KI.18.20	Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
2KI.18.21	Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.
2KI.18.22	But if ye say unto me, We trust in the 
2KI.18.23	Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
2KI.18.24	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
2KI.18.25	Am I now come up without the 
2KI.18.26	Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rab–shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
2KI.18.27	But Rab–shakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?
2KI.18.28	Then Rab–shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:
2KI.18.29	Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:
2KI.18.30	Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the 
2KI.18.31	Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:
2KI.18.32	Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The 
2KI.18.33	Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
2KI.18.34	Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?
2KI.18.35	Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the 
2KI.18.36	But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
2KI.18.37	Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab–shakeh.
2KI.19.1	And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the 
2KI.19.2	And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
2KI.19.3	And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
2KI.19.4	It may be the 
2KI.19.5	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
2KI.19.6	And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the 
2KI.19.7	Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
2KI.19.8	So Rab–shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
2KI.19.9	And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,
2KI.19.10	Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
2KI.19.11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?
2KI.19.12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?
2KI.19.13	Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?
2KI.19.14	And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the 
2KI.19.15	And Hezekiah prayed before the 
2KI.19.17	Of a truth, 
2KI.19.18	And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
2KI.19.19	Now therefore, O 
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the 
2KI.19.21	This is the word that the 
2KI.19.22	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.
2KI.19.23	By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.
2KI.19.24	I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.
2KI.19.25	Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.
2KI.19.26	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.
2KI.19.27	But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
2KI.19.28	Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
2KI.19.29	And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.
2KI.19.30	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
2KI.19.31	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the 
2KI.19.32	Therefore thus saith the 
2KI.19.33	By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the 
2KI.19.34	For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
2KI.19.35	And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the 
2KI.19.36	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
2KI.19.37	And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esar–haddon his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.20.1	In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
2KI.20.2	Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the 
2KI.20.3	I beseech thee, O 
2KI.20.4	And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the 
2KI.20.5	Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the 
2KI.20.6	And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
2KI.20.7	And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.
2KI.20.8	And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the 
2KI.20.9	And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the 
2KI.20.10	And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.
2KI.20.11	And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the 
2KI.20.12	At that time Berodach–baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
2KI.20.13	And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.
2KI.20.14	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.
2KI.20.15	And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.
2KI.20.16	And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the 
2KI.20.17	Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the 
2KI.20.18	And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
2KI.20.19	Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the 
2KI.20.20	And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.20.21	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.21.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hephzi–bah.
2KI.21.2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.21.3	For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
2KI.21.4	And he built altars in the house of the 
2KI.21.5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the 
2KI.21.6	And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the 
2KI.21.7	And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the 
2KI.21.8	Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
2KI.21.9	But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the 
2KI.21.10	And the 
2KI.21.11	Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols:
2KI.21.12	Therefore thus saith the 
2KI.21.13	And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.
2KI.21.14	And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
2KI.21.15	Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.
2KI.21.16	Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.21.17	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.21.18	And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.21.19	Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
2KI.21.20	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.21.21	And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:
2KI.21.22	And he forsook the 
2KI.21.23	And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.
2KI.21.24	And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
2KI.21.25	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.21.26	And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.22.1	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.
2KI.22.2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2KI.22.3	And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the 
2KI.22.4	Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the 
2KI.22.5	And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the 
2KI.22.6	Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
2KI.22.7	Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.
2KI.22.8	And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the 
2KI.22.9	And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the 
2KI.22.10	And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
2KI.22.11	And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.
2KI.22.12	And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,
2KI.22.13	Go ye, enquire of the 
2KI.22.14	So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.
2KI.22.15	And she said unto them, Thus saith the 
2KI.22.16	Thus saith the 
2KI.22.17	Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.
2KI.22.18	But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the 
2KI.22.19	Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the 
2KI.22.20	Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.
2KI.23.1	And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
2KI.23.2	And the king went up into the house of the 
2KI.23.3	And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the 
2KI.23.4	And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the 
2KI.23.5	And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
2KI.23.6	And he brought out the grove from the house of the 
2KI.23.7	And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the 
2KI.23.8	And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer–sheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.
2KI.23.9	Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the 
2KI.23.10	And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
2KI.23.11	And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the 
2KI.23.12	And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the 
2KI.23.13	And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
2KI.23.14	And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.
2KI.23.15	Moreover the altar that was at Beth–el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.
2KI.23.16	And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the 
2KI.23.17	Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth–el.
2KI.23.18	And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
2KI.23.19	And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the 
2KI.23.20	And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.
2KI.23.21	And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the 
2KI.23.22	Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;
2KI.23.23	But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the 
2KI.23.24	Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the 
2KI.23.25	And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the 
2KI.23.26	Notwithstanding the 
2KI.23.27	And the 
2KI.23.28	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.23.29	In his days Pharaoh–neco king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
2KI.23.30	And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2KI.23.32	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.23.33	And Pharaoh–neco put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
2KI.23.34	And Pharaoh–neco made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.
2KI.23.35	And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh–neco.
2KI.23.36	Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
2KI.23.37	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.1	In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.
2KI.24.2	And the 
2KI.24.3	Surely at the commandment of the 
2KI.24.4	And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the 
2KI.24.5	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.24.6	So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.24.7	And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
2KI.24.9	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.10	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
2KI.24.11	And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it.
2KI.24.12	And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
2KI.24.13	And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the 
2KI.24.14	And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.
2KI.24.15	And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
2KI.24.16	And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
2KI.24.17	And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
2KI.24.18	Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2KI.24.19	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.20	For through the anger of the 
2KI.25.1	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.
2KI.25.2	And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
2KI.25.3	And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
2KI.25.4	And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.
2KI.25.5	And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.
2KI.25.6	So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.
2KI.25.7	And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.
2KI.25.8	And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar–adan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:
2KI.25.9	And he burnt the house of the 
2KI.25.10	And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
2KI.25.11	Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard carry away.
2KI.25.12	But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.
2KI.25.13	And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the 
2KI.25.14	And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.
2KI.25.15	And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.
2KI.25.16	The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the 
2KI.25.17	The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work.
2KI.25.18	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
2KI.25.19	And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city:
2KI.25.20	And Nebuzar–adan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:
2KI.25.21	And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.
2KI.25.22	And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.
2KI.25.23	And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
2KI.25.24	And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.
2KI.25.25	But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.
2KI.25.26	And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
2KI.25.27	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil–merodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;
2KI.25.28	And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;
2KI.25.29	And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life.
2KI.25.30	And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.

1CH.5.21	And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.
1CH.5.22	For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.
1CH.5.23	And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land: they increased from Bashan unto Baal–hermon and Senir, and unto mount Hermon.

1CH.9.22	All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office.
1CH.9.23	So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the

1CH.9.25	And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them.
1CH.9.26	For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.

1CH.10.1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
1CH.10.2	And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi–shua, the sons of Saul.
1CH.10.3	And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.
1CH.10.4	Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
1CH.10.5	And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.
1CH.10.6	So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.
1CH.10.7	And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
1CH.10.8	And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
1CH.10.9	And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.
1CH.10.10	And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
1CH.10.11	And when all Jabesh–gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
1CH.10.12	They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
1CH.10.13	So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the 
1CH.10.14	And enquired not of the 
1CH.11.1	Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
1CH.11.2	And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the 
1CH.11.3	Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the 
1CH.11.4	And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
1CH.11.5	And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.
1CH.11.6	And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.
1CH.11.7	And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.
1CH.11.8	And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
1CH.11.9	So David waxed greater and greater: for the 
1CH.11.10	These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the 
1CH.11.11	And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.
1CH.11.12	And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.
1CH.11.13	He was with David at Pas–dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
1CH.11.14	And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the 
1CH.11.15	Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
1CH.11.16	And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Beth–lehem.
1CH.11.17	And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth–lehem, that is at the gate!
1CH.11.18	And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth–lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the 
1CH.11.19	And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.
1CH.11.20	And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.
1CH.11.21	Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.
1CH.11.22	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.
1CH.11.23	And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
1CH.11.24	These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.
1CH.11.25	Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.
1CH.11.26	Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth–lehem,
1CH.11.27	Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
1CH.11.28	Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abi–ezer the Anathothite,

1CH.11.32	Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
1CH.11.33	Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,

1CH.11.35	Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,
1CH.11.36	Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
1CH.11.37	Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,
1CH.11.38	Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,
1CH.11.39	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,
1CH.11.40	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
1CH.11.41	Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,
1CH.11.42	Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,
1CH.11.43	Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,
1CH.11.44	Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite,
1CH.11.45	Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,
1CH.11.46	Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,
1CH.11.47	Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.
1CH.12.1	Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.
1CH.12.2	They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.
1CH.12.3	The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Anathothite,
1CH.12.4	And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite,
1CH.12.5	Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,
1CH.12.6	Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites,
1CH.12.7	And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
1CH.12.8	And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains;
1CH.12.9	Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
1CH.12.10	Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
1CH.12.11	Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
1CH.12.12	Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
1CH.12.13	Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.
1CH.12.14	These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.
1CH.12.15	These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.
1CH.12.16	And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.
1CH.12.17	And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.
1CH.12.18	Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.
1CH.12.19	And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.
1CH.12.20	As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.
1CH.12.21	And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.
1CH.12.22	For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.
1CH.12.23	And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the 
1CH.12.24	The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.
1CH.12.25	Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.
1CH.12.26	Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
1CH.12.27	And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred;
1CH.12.28	And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's house twenty and two captains.
1CH.12.29	And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.
1CH.12.30	And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.
1CH.12.31	And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king.
1CH.12.32	And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.
1CH.12.33	Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of double heart.
1CH.12.34	And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.
1CH.12.35	And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.
1CH.12.36	And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.
1CH.12.37	And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.
1CH.12.38	All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.
1CH.12.39	And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.
1CH.12.40	Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.
1CH.13.1	And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.
1CH.13.2	And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the 
1CH.13.3	And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.
1CH.13.4	And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
1CH.13.5	So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath–jearim.
1CH.13.6	And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjath–jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the 
1CH.13.7	And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.
1CH.13.8	And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
1CH.13.9	And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
1CH.13.10	And the anger of the 
1CH.13.11	And David was displeased, because the 
1CH.13.12	And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?
1CH.13.13	So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed–edom the Gittite.
1CH.13.14	And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed–edom in his house three months. And the 
1CH.14.1	Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.
1CH.14.2	And David perceived that the 
1CH.14.3	And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.
1CH.14.4	Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
1CH.14.5	And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,
1CH.14.6	And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
1CH.14.7	And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
1CH.14.8	And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them.
1CH.14.9	And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
1CH.14.10	And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the 
1CH.14.11	So they came up to Baal–perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal–perazim.
1CH.14.12	And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.
1CH.14.13	And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.
1CH.14.14	Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.
1CH.14.15	And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.
1CH.14.16	David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.
1CH.14.17	And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the 
1CH.15.1	And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.
1CH.15.2	Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the 
1CH.15.3	And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.4	And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:
1CH.15.5	Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:
1CH.15.6	Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:
1CH.15.7	Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:
1CH.15.8	Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:
1CH.15.9	Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:
1CH.15.10	Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.
1CH.15.11	And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
1CH.15.12	And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.13	For because ye did it not at the first, the 
1CH.15.14	So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.15	And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the 
1CH.15.16	And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
1CH.15.18	And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed–edom, and Jeiel, the porters.
1CH.15.19	So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass;
1CH.15.20	And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;
1CH.15.21	And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed–edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.
1CH.15.22	And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.
1CH.15.23	And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.
1CH.15.24	And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed–edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.
1CH.15.25	So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.26	And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.27	And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.
1CH.15.28	Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.29	And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.16.1	So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.
1CH.16.2	And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
1CH.16.3	And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.
1CH.16.4	And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the 
1CH.16.5	Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed–edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;
1CH.16.6	Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
1CH.16.7	Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the 
1CH.16.8	Give thanks unto the 
1CH.16.9	Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.
1CH.16.10	Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the 
1CH.16.11	Seek the 
1CH.16.12	Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
1CH.16.13	O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
1CH.16.14	He is the 
1CH.16.15	Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations;
1CH.16.16	Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;
1CH.16.17	And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,
1CH.16.18	Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;
1CH.16.19	When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.
1CH.16.20	And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people;
1CH.16.21	He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
1CH.16.22	Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
1CH.16.23	Sing unto the 
1CH.16.24	Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.
1CH.16.25	For great is the 
1CH.16.26	For all the gods of the people are idols: but the 
1CH.16.27	Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.
1CH.16.28	Give unto the 
1CH.16.29	Give unto the 
1CH.16.30	Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.
1CH.16.31	Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The 
1CH.16.32	Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.
1CH.16.33	Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the 
1CH.16.34	O give thanks unto the 
1CH.16.35	And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.
1CH.16.36	Blessed be the 
1CH.16.37	So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.16.38	And Obed–edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed–edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:
1CH.16.39	And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the 
1CH.16.40	To offer burnt offerings unto the 
1CH.16.41	And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the 
1CH.16.42	And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.
1CH.16.43	And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
1CH.17.1	Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.17.2	Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.
1CH.17.3	And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
1CH.17.4	Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the 
1CH.17.5	For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.
1CH.17.6	Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?
1CH.17.7	Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the 
1CH.17.8	And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.
1CH.17.9	Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,
1CH.17.10	And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the 
1CH.17.11	And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
1CH.17.12	He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.
1CH.17.13	I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:
1CH.17.14	But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.
1CH.17.15	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
1CH.17.16	And David the king came and sat before the 
1CH.17.17	And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O 
1CH.17.18	What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.
1CH.17.19	O 
1CH.17.20	O 
1CH.17.21	And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?
1CH.17.22	For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, 
1CH.17.23	Therefore now, 
1CH.17.24	Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The 
1CH.17.25	For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.
1CH.17.26	And now, 
1CH.17.27	Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O 
1CH.18.1	Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
1CH.18.2	And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.
1CH.18.3	And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
1CH.18.4	And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.
1CH.18.5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
1CH.18.6	Then David put garrisons in Syria–damascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the 
1CH.18.7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
1CH.18.8	Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
1CH.18.9	Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;
1CH.18.10	He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
1CH.18.11	Them also king David dedicated unto the 
1CH.18.12	Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.
1CH.18.13	And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the 
1CH.18.14	So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.
1CH.18.15	And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.
1CH.18.16	And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
1CH.18.17	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.
1CH.19.1	Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.
1CH.19.2	And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
1CH.19.3	But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
1CH.19.4	Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.
1CH.19.5	Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
1CH.19.6	And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria–maacah, and out of Zobah.
1CH.19.7	So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.
1CH.19.8	And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
1CH.19.9	And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.
1CH.19.10	Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.
1CH.19.11	And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
1CH.19.12	And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.
1CH.19.13	Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the 
1CH.19.14	So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.
1CH.19.15	And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
1CH.19.17	And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
1CH.19.18	But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.
1CH.19.19	And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.
1CH.20.1	And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.
1CH.20.2	And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.
1CH.20.3	And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
1CH.20.4	And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.
1CH.20.5	And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.
1CH.20.6	And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant.
1CH.20.7	But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him.
1CH.20.8	These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
1CH.21.1	And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.
1CH.21.2	And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer–sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.
1CH.21.3	And Joab answered, The 
1CH.21.4	Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
1CH.21.5	And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.
1CH.21.6	But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.
1CH.21.7	And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.
1CH.21.8	And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
1CH.21.9	And the 
1CH.21.10	Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the 
1CH.21.11	So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
1CH.21.12	Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the 
1CH.21.13	And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the 
1CH.21.14	So the 
1CH.21.15	And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the 
1CH.21.16	And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the 
1CH.21.17	And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O 
1CH.21.18	Then the angel of the 
1CH.21.19	And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the 
1CH.21.20	And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
1CH.21.21	And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
1CH.21.22	Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the 
1CH.21.23	And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.
1CH.21.24	And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the 
1CH.21.25	So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
1CH.21.26	And David built there an altar unto the 
1CH.21.27	And the 
1CH.21.28	At that time when David saw that the 
1CH.21.29	For the tabernacle of the 
1CH.21.30	But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the 
1CH.22.1	Then David said, This is the house of the 
1CH.22.2	And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.
1CH.22.3	And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;
1CH.22.4	Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.
1CH.22.5	And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the 
1CH.22.6	Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the 
1CH.22.7	And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the 
1CH.22.8	But the word of the 
1CH.22.9	Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.
1CH.22.10	He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
1CH.22.11	Now, my son, the 
1CH.22.12	Only the 
1CH.22.13	Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the 
1CH.22.14	Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the 
1CH.22.15	Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.
1CH.22.16	Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the 
1CH.22.17	David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
1CH.22.18	Is not the 
1CH.22.19	Now set your heart and your soul to seek the 
1CH.23.1	So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
1CH.23.2	And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
1CH.23.3	Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.
1CH.23.4	Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the 
1CH.23.5	Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the 
1CH.23.6	And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1CH.23.7	Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.
1CH.23.8	The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
1CH.23.9	The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.
1CH.23.10	And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
1CH.23.11	And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house.
1CH.23.12	The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
1CH.23.13	The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the 
1CH.23.14	Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.
1CH.23.15	The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.
1CH.23.16	Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.
1CH.23.17	And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
1CH.23.18	Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.
1CH.23.19	Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
1CH.23.20	Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah the first, and Isshiah the second.
1CH.23.21	The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.
1CH.23.22	And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.
1CH.23.23	The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
1CH.23.24	These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the 
1CH.23.25	For David said, The 
1CH.23.26	And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.
1CH.23.27	For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:
1CH.23.28	Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the 
1CH.23.29	Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;
1CH.23.30	And to stand every morning to thank and praise the 
1CH.23.31	And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the 
1CH.23.32	And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the 
1CH.24.1	Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
1CH.24.2	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.
1CH.24.3	And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.
1CH.24.4	And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.
1CH.24.5	Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.
1CH.24.6	And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.
1CH.24.7	Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
1CH.24.8	The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
1CH.24.9	The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,

1CH.24.19	These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the 
1CH.24.20	And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.
1CH.24.21	Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.

1CH.24.28	Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.
1CH.24.29	Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.
1CH.24.30	The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.
1CH.24.31	These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.
1CH.25.1	Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:
1CH.25.2	Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied according to the order of the king.
1CH.25.3	Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the

1CH.25.5	All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
1CH.25.6	All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the 
1CH.25.7	So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the 
1CH.25.8	And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.

1CH.26.8	All these of the sons of Obed–edom: they and their sons and their brethren, able men for strength for the service, were threescore and two of Obed–edom.
1CH.26.9	And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.
1CH.26.10	Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;)
1CH.26.11	Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.
1CH.26.12	Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the

1CH.27.6	This is that Benaiah, who was mighty among the thirty, and above the thirty: and in his course was Ammizabad his son.
1CH.27.7	The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.
1CH.27.8	The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.
1CH.27.9	The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.
1CH.27.10	The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.
1CH.27.11	The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

1CH.27.14	The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.
1CH.27.15	The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.
1CH.27.16	Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maachah:
1CH.27.17	Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of the Aaronites, Zadok:
1CH.27.18	Of Judah, Elihu, one of the brethren of David: of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael:
1CH.27.19	Of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jerimoth the son of Azriel:
1CH.27.20	Of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah: of the half tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah:
1CH.27.21	Of the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner:
1CH.27.22	Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of the tribes of Israel.
1CH.27.23	But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the 
1CH.27.24	Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.
1CH.27.25	And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah:
1CH.27.26	And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:
1CH.27.27	And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite:
1CH.27.28	And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low plains was Baal–hanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash:
1CH.27.29	And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai:
1CH.27.30	Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:
1CH.27.31	And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagarite. All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David's.
1CH.27.32	Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons:
1CH.27.33	And Ahithophel was the king's counsellor: and Hushai the Archite was the king's companion:
1CH.27.34	And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the general of the king's army was Joab.
1CH.28.1	And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem.
1CH.28.2	Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.28.3	But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.
1CH.28.4	Howbeit the 
1CH.28.5	And of all my sons, (for the 
1CH.28.6	And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
1CH.28.7	Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.
1CH.28.8	Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the 
1CH.28.9	And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the 
1CH.28.10	Take heed now; for the 
1CH.28.11	Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,
1CH.28.12	And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the 
1CH.28.13	Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the 
1CH.28.14	He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:
1CH.28.15	Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.
1CH.28.16	And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:
1CH.28.17	Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basins he gave gold by weight for every basin; and likewise silver by weight for every basin of silver:
1CH.28.18	And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.28.19	All this, said David, the 
1CH.28.20	And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the 
1CH.28.21	And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.
1CH.29.1	Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the 
1CH.29.2	Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
1CH.29.3	Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,
1CH.29.4	Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal:
1CH.29.5	The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the 
1CH.29.6	Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,
1CH.29.7	And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
1CH.29.8	And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the 
1CH.29.9	Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the 
1CH.29.10	Wherefore David blessed the 
1CH.29.11	Thine, O 
1CH.29.12	Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.
1CH.29.13	Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.
1CH.29.14	But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.
1CH.29.15	For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.
1CH.29.16	O 
1CH.29.17	I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.
1CH.29.18	O 
1CH.29.19	And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.
1CH.29.20	And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the 
1CH.29.21	And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the 
1CH.29.22	And did eat and drink before the 
1CH.29.23	Then Solomon sat on the throne of the 
1CH.29.24	And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.
1CH.29.25	And the 
1CH.29.26	Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
1CH.29.27	And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
1CH.29.28	And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
1CH.29.29	Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,
1CH.29.30	With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
2CH.1.1	And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the 
2CH.1.2	Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.
2CH.1.3	So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the 
2CH.1.4	But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath–jearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
2CH.1.5	Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the 
2CH.1.6	And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the 
2CH.1.7	In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.
2CH.1.8	And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.
2CH.1.9	Now, O 
2CH.1.10	Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?
2CH.1.11	And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
2CH.1.12	Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.
2CH.1.13	Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.
2CH.1.14	And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
2CH.1.15	And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance.
2CH.1.16	And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
2CH.1.17	And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.
2CH.2.1	And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the 
2CH.2.2	And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
2CH.2.3	And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.
2CH.2.4	Behold, I build an house to the name of the 
2CH.2.5	And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.
2CH.2.6	But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?
2CH.2.7	Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
2CH.2.8	Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,
2CH.2.9	Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.
2CH.2.10	And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
2CH.2.11	Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the 
2CH.2.12	Huram said moreover, Blessed be the 
2CH.2.13	And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,
2CH.2.14	The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.
2CH.2.15	Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:
2CH.2.16	And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.
2CH.2.17	And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
2CH.2.18	And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.
2CH.3.1	Then Solomon began to build the house of the 
2CH.3.2	And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
2CH.3.3	Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
2CH.3.4	And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
2CH.3.5	And the greater house he ceiled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.
2CH.3.6	And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
2CH.3.7	He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.
2CH.3.8	And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
2CH.3.9	And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
2CH.3.10	And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.
2CH.3.11	And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
2CH.3.12	And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
2CH.3.13	The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.
2CH.3.14	And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.
2CH.3.15	Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
2CH.3.16	And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
2CH.3.17	And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
2CH.4.1	Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.
2CH.4.2	Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
2CH.4.3	And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.
2CH.4.4	It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
2CH.4.5	And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths.
2CH.4.6	He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
2CH.4.7	And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
2CH.4.8	He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basins of gold.
2CH.4.9	Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
2CH.4.10	And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.
2CH.4.11	And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;
2CH.4.12	To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars;
2CH.4.13	And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars.
2CH.4.14	He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;
2CH.4.15	One sea, and twelve oxen under it.
2CH.4.16	The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the 
2CH.4.17	In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
2CH.4.18	Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
2CH.4.19	And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;
2CH.4.20	Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;
2CH.4.21	And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that perfect gold;
2CH.4.22	And the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.
2CH.5.1	Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the 
2CH.5.2	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the 
2CH.5.3	Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.
2CH.5.4	And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.
2CH.5.5	And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.
2CH.5.6	Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
2CH.5.7	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the 
2CH.5.8	For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
2CH.5.9	And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.
2CH.5.10	There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the 
2CH.5.11	And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:
2CH.5.12	Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)
2CH.5.13	It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the 
2CH.5.14	So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the 
2CH.6.1	Then said Solomon, The 
2CH.6.2	But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.
2CH.6.3	And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.
2CH.6.4	And he said, Blessed be the 
2CH.6.5	Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:
2CH.6.6	But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
2CH.6.7	Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the 
2CH.6.8	But the 
2CH.6.9	Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
2CH.6.10	The 
2CH.6.11	And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the 
2CH.6.12	And he stood before the altar of the 
2CH.6.13	For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven,
2CH.6.14	And said, O 
2CH.6.15	Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.
2CH.6.16	Now therefore, O 
2CH.6.17	Now then, O 
2CH.6.18	But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!
2CH.6.19	Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O 
2CH.6.20	That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place.
2CH.6.21	Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.
2CH.6.22	If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;
2CH.6.23	Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.
2CH.6.24	And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;
2CH.6.25	Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
2CH.6.26	When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them;
2CH.6.27	Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.
2CH.6.28	If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:
2CH.6.29	Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:
2CH.6.30	Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)
2CH.6.31	That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
2CH.6.32	Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house;
2CH.6.33	Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
2CH.6.34	If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;
2CH.6.35	Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
2CH.6.36	If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;
2CH.6.37	Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;
2CH.6.38	If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:
2CH.6.39	Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee.
2CH.6.40	Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.
2CH.6.41	Now therefore arise, O 
2CH.6.42	O 
2CH.7.1	Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the 
2CH.7.2	And the priests could not enter into the house of the 
2CH.7.3	And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the 
2CH.7.4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the 
2CH.7.5	And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
2CH.7.6	And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the 
2CH.7.7	Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the 
2CH.7.8	Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.
2CH.7.9	And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
2CH.7.10	And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the 
2CH.7.11	Thus Solomon finished the house of the 
2CH.7.12	And the 
2CH.7.13	If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
2CH.7.14	If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
2CH.7.15	Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.
2CH.7.16	For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.
2CH.7.17	And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;
2CH.7.18	Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.
2CH.7.19	But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
2CH.7.20	Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations.
2CH.7.21	And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the 
2CH.7.22	And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the 
2CH.8.1	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the 
2CH.8.2	That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
2CH.8.3	And Solomon went to Hamath–zobah, and prevailed against it.
2CH.8.4	And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.
2CH.8.5	Also he built Beth–horon the upper, and Beth–horon the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
2CH.8.6	And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.
2CH.8.7	As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel,
2CH.8.8	But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.
2CH.8.9	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.
2CH.8.10	And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.
2CH.8.11	And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the 
2CH.8.12	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the 
2CH.8.13	Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.
2CH.8.14	And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.
2CH.8.15	And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
2CH.8.16	Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the 
2CH.8.17	Then went Solomon to Ezion–geber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.
2CH.8.18	And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.
2CH.9.1	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
2CH.9.2	And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.
2CH.9.3	And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
2CH.9.4	And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the 
2CH.9.5	And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:
2CH.9.6	Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard.
2CH.9.7	Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
2CH.9.8	Blessed be the 
2CH.9.9	And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.
2CH.9.10	And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.
2CH.9.11	And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the 
2CH.9.12	And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.
2CH.9.13	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;
2CH.9.14	Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2CH.9.15	And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.
2CH.9.16	And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
2CH.9.17	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
2CH.9.18	And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays:
2CH.9.19	And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
2CH.9.20	And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
2CH.9.21	For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
2CH.9.22	And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
2CH.9.23	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.
2CH.9.24	And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
2CH.9.25	And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
2CH.9.26	And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
2CH.9.27	And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.
2CH.9.28	And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
2CH.9.29	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
2CH.9.30	And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
2CH.9.31	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.10.1	And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king.
2CH.10.2	And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
2CH.10.3	And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying,
2CH.10.4	Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
2CH.10.5	And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.
2CH.10.6	And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?
2CH.10.7	And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.
2CH.10.8	But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
2CH.10.9	And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?
2CH.10.10	And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
2CH.10.11	For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
2CH.10.12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
2CH.10.13	And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
2CH.10.14	And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
2CH.10.15	So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the 
2CH.10.16	And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.
2CH.10.17	But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
2CH.10.18	Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
2CH.10.19	And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
2CH.11.1	And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
2CH.11.2	But the word of the 
2CH.11.3	Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
2CH.11.4	Thus saith the 
2CH.11.5	And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.
2CH.11.6	He built even Beth–lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
2CH.11.7	And Beth–zur, and Soco, and Adullam,
2CH.11.8	And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
2CH.11.9	And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
2CH.11.10	And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.
2CH.11.11	And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.
2CH.11.12	And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
2CH.11.13	And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.
2CH.11.14	For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the 
2CH.11.15	And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
2CH.11.16	And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the 
2CH.11.17	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.
2CH.11.18	And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;
2CH.11.19	Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.
2CH.11.20	And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
2CH.11.21	And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)
2CH.11.22	And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.
2CH.11.23	And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.
2CH.12.1	And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the 
2CH.12.2	And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the 
2CH.12.3	With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Libyans, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
2CH.12.4	And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
2CH.12.5	Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the 
2CH.12.6	Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The 
2CH.12.7	And when the 
2CH.12.8	Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
2CH.12.9	So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.12.10	Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.
2CH.12.11	And when the king entered into the house of the 
2CH.12.12	And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the 
2CH.12.13	So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the 
2CH.12.14	And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the 
2CH.12.15	Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
2CH.12.16	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.13.1	Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
2CH.13.2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
2CH.13.3	And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.
2CH.13.4	And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;
2CH.13.5	Ought ye not to know that the 
2CH.13.6	Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.
2CH.13.7	And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.
2CH.13.8	And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the 
2CH.13.9	Have ye not cast out the priests of the 
2CH.13.10	But as for us, the 
2CH.13.11	And they burn unto the 
2CH.13.12	And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the 
2CH.13.13	But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.
2CH.13.14	And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the 
2CH.13.15	Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
2CH.13.16	And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.
2CH.13.17	And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
2CH.13.18	Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the 
2CH.13.19	And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth–el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.
2CH.13.20	Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the 
2CH.13.21	But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
2CH.13.22	And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
2CH.14.1	So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.
2CH.14.2	And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the 
2CH.14.3	For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:
2CH.14.4	And commanded Judah to seek the 
2CH.14.5	Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
2CH.14.6	And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the 
2CH.14.7	Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the 
2CH.14.8	And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.
2CH.14.9	And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.
2CH.14.10	Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
2CH.14.11	And Asa cried unto the 
2CH.14.12	So the 
2CH.14.13	And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the 
2CH.14.14	And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the 
2CH.14.15	They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:
2CH.15.2	And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The 
2CH.15.3	Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
2CH.15.4	But when they in their trouble did turn unto the 
2CH.15.5	And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.
2CH.15.6	And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.
2CH.15.7	Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.
2CH.15.8	And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the 
2CH.15.9	And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the 
2CH.15.10	So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
2CH.15.11	And they offered unto the 
2CH.15.12	And they entered into a covenant to seek the 
2CH.15.13	That whosoever would not seek the 
2CH.15.14	And they sware unto the 
2CH.15.15	And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the 
2CH.15.16	And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
2CH.15.17	But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
2CH.15.18	And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
2CH.15.19	And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.
2CH.16.1	In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
2CH.16.2	Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.16.3	There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
2CH.16.4	And Ben–hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel–maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
2CH.16.5	And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.
2CH.16.6	Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
2CH.16.7	And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the 
2CH.16.8	Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the 
2CH.16.9	For the eyes of the 
2CH.16.10	Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.
2CH.16.11	And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2CH.16.12	And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the 
2CH.16.13	And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.
2CH.16.14	And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.
2CH.17.1	And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.
2CH.17.2	And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
2CH.17.3	And the 
2CH.17.4	But sought to the 
2CH.17.5	Therefore the 
2CH.17.6	And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the 
2CH.17.7	Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Ben–hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.
2CH.17.8	And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob–adonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.
2CH.17.9	And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the 
2CH.17.10	And the fear of the 
2CH.17.11	Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.
2CH.17.12	And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store.
2CH.17.13	And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.
2CH.17.14	And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.
2CH.17.15	And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand.
2CH.17.16	And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the 
2CH.17.17	And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.
2CH.17.18	And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.
2CH.17.19	These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.
2CH.18.1	Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.
2CH.18.2	And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth–gilead.
2CH.18.3	And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth–gilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.
2CH.18.4	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the 
2CH.18.5	Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth–gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the 
2CH.18.7	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the 
2CH.18.8	And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.
2CH.18.9	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
2CH.18.10	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the 
2CH.18.11	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth–gilead, and prosper: for the 
2CH.18.12	And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
2CH.18.13	And Micaiah said, As the 
2CH.18.14	And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth–gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.
2CH.18.15	And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the 
2CH.18.16	Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the 
2CH.18.17	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?
2CH.18.18	Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the 
2CH.18.19	And the 
2CH.18.20	Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the 
2CH.18.21	And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the 
2CH.18.22	Now therefore, behold, the 
2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the 
2CH.18.24	And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
2CH.18.25	Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
2CH.18.26	And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
2CH.18.27	And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the 
2CH.18.28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth–gilead.
2CH.18.29	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.
2CH.18.30	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.
2CH.18.31	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the 
2CH.18.32	For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.
2CH.18.33	And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
2CH.18.34	And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.
2CH.19.1	And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
2CH.19.2	And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the 
2CH.19.3	Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.
2CH.19.4	And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beer–sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the 
2CH.19.5	And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,
2CH.19.6	And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the 
2CH.19.7	Wherefore now let the fear of the 
2CH.19.8	Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the 
2CH.19.9	And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the 
2CH.19.10	And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the 
2CH.19.11	And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the 
2CH.20.1	It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.
2CH.20.2	Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazon–tamar, which is En–gedi.
2CH.20.3	And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the 
2CH.20.4	And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the 
2CH.20.5	And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the 
2CH.20.6	And said, O 
2CH.20.7	Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?
2CH.20.8	And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,
2CH.20.9	If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.
2CH.20.10	And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;
2CH.20.11	Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.
2CH.20.12	O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.
2CH.20.13	And all Judah stood before the 
2CH.20.14	Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the 
2CH.20.15	And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the 
2CH.20.16	To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
2CH.20.17	Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the 
2CH.20.18	And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the 
2CH.20.19	And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the 
2CH.20.20	And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the 
2CH.20.21	And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the 
2CH.20.22	And when they began to sing and to praise, the 
2CH.20.23	For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.
2CH.20.24	And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.
2CH.20.25	And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.
2CH.20.26	And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the 
2CH.20.27	Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the 
2CH.20.28	And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the 
2CH.20.29	And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the 
2CH.20.30	So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.
2CH.20.31	And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
2CH.20.32	And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.20.33	Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.
2CH.20.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.
2CH.20.35	And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:
2CH.20.36	And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion–geber.
2CH.20.37	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the 
2CH.21.1	Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.21.2	And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
2CH.21.3	And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.
2CH.21.4	Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.
2CH.21.5	Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
2CH.21.6	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the 
2CH.21.7	Howbeit the 
2CH.21.8	In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.
2CH.21.9	Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.
2CH.21.10	So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the 
2CH.21.11	Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto.
2CH.21.12	And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the 
2CH.21.13	But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than thyself:
2CH.21.14	Behold, with a great plague will the 
2CH.21.15	And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.
2CH.21.16	Moreover the 
2CH.21.17	And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
2CH.21.18	And after all this the 
2CH.21.19	And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.
2CH.21.20	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.
2CH.22.1	And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
2CH.22.2	Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
2CH.22.3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.
2CH.22.4	Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the 
2CH.22.5	He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth–gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.
2CH.22.6	And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.
2CH.22.7	And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the 
2CH.22.8	And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.
2CH.22.9	And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the 
2CH.22.10	But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.
2CH.22.11	But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
2CH.22.12	And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.
2CH.23.1	And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.
2CH.23.2	And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
2CH.23.3	And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the 
2CH.23.4	This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors;
2CH.23.5	And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the 
2CH.23.6	But let none come into the house of the 
2CH.23.7	And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.
2CH.23.8	So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.
2CH.23.9	Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God.
2CH.23.10	And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.
2CH.23.11	Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.
2CH.23.12	Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the 
2CH.23.13	And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.
2CH.23.14	Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the 
2CH.23.15	So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.
2CH.23.16	And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the 
2CH.23.17	Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
2CH.23.18	Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the 
2CH.23.19	And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the 
2CH.23.20	And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the 
2CH.23.21	And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.
2CH.24.1	Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Zibiah of Beer–sheba.
2CH.24.2	And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.24.3	And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the 
2CH.24.5	And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.
2CH.24.6	And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the 
2CH.24.7	For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the 
2CH.24.8	And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the 
2CH.24.9	And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the 
2CH.24.10	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
2CH.24.11	Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
2CH.24.12	And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the 
2CH.24.13	So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.
2CH.24.14	And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the 
2CH.24.15	But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.
2CH.24.16	And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.
2CH.24.17	Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.
2CH.24.18	And they left the house of the 
2CH.24.19	Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the 
2CH.24.20	And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the 
2CH.24.21	And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the 
2CH.24.22	Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The 
2CH.24.23	And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.
2CH.24.24	For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the 
2CH.24.25	And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.
2CH.24.26	And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.
2CH.24.27	Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.25.1	Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
2CH.25.2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.25.3	Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.
2CH.25.4	But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the 
2CH.25.5	Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.
2CH.25.6	He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.
2CH.25.7	But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the 
2CH.25.8	But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.
2CH.25.9	And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The 
2CH.25.10	Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.
2CH.25.11	And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.
2CH.25.12	And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.
2CH.25.13	But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth–horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.
2CH.25.14	Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.
2CH.25.15	Wherefore the anger of the 
2CH.25.16	And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.
2CH.25.17	Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.
2CH.25.18	And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.
2CH.25.19	Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
2CH.25.20	But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.
2CH.25.21	So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth–shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
2CH.25.22	And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.
2CH.25.23	And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth–shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
2CH.25.24	And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed–edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
2CH.25.25	And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
2CH.25.26	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
2CH.25.27	Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the 
2CH.25.28	And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
2CH.26.1	Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.
2CH.26.2	He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
2CH.26.3	Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
2CH.26.4	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.26.5	And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the 
2CH.26.6	And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
2CH.26.7	And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur–baal, and the Mehunims.
2CH.26.8	And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.
2CH.26.9	Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.
2CH.26.10	Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.
2CH.26.11	Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.
2CH.26.12	The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred.
2CH.26.13	And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
2CH.26.14	And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.
2CH.26.15	And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.
2CH.26.16	But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the 
2CH.26.17	And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the 
2CH.26.18	And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the 
2CH.26.19	Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the 
2CH.26.20	And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the 
2CH.26.21	And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the 
2CH.26.22	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.
2CH.26.23	So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.27.1	Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
2CH.27.2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.27.3	He built the high gate of the house of the 
2CH.27.4	Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.
2CH.27.5	He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.
2CH.27.6	So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the 
2CH.27.7	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2CH.27.8	He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
2CH.27.9	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.28.2	For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.
2CH.28.3	Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the 
2CH.28.4	He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
2CH.28.5	Wherefore the 
2CH.28.6	For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the 
2CH.28.7	And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.
2CH.28.8	And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
2CH.28.9	But a prophet of the 
2CH.28.10	And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the 
2CH.28.11	Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the 
2CH.28.12	Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,
2CH.28.13	And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the 
2CH.28.14	So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.
2CH.28.15	And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.
2CH.28.16	At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.
2CH.28.17	For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
2CH.28.18	The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth–shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.
2CH.28.19	For the 
2CH.28.20	And Tilgath–pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
2CH.28.21	For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the 
2CH.28.22	And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the 
2CH.28.23	For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
2CH.28.24	And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the 
2CH.28.25	And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the 
2CH.28.26	Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2CH.28.27	And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
2CH.29.2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.29.3	He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the 
2CH.29.4	And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street,
2CH.29.5	And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the 
2CH.29.6	For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the 
2CH.29.7	Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.
2CH.29.8	Wherefore the wrath of the 
2CH.29.9	For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
2CH.29.10	Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the 
2CH.29.11	My sons, be not now negligent: for the 
2CH.29.12	Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:
2CH.29.13	And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:
2CH.29.14	And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.
2CH.29.15	And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the 
2CH.29.16	And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the 
2CH.29.17	Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the 
2CH.29.18	Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the 
2CH.29.19	Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the 
2CH.29.20	Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the 
2CH.29.21	And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the 
2CH.29.22	So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
2CH.29.23	And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:
2CH.29.24	And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.
2CH.29.25	And he set the Levites in the house of the 
2CH.29.26	And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
2CH.29.27	And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the 
2CH.29.28	And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.
2CH.29.29	And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.
2CH.29.30	Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the 
2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the 
2CH.29.32	And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the 
2CH.29.33	And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
2CH.29.34	But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
2CH.29.35	And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the 
2CH.29.36	And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.
2CH.30.1	And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the 
2CH.30.2	For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
2CH.30.3	For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
2CH.30.4	And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
2CH.30.5	So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer–sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the 
2CH.30.6	So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the 
2CH.30.7	And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the 
2CH.30.8	Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the 
2CH.30.9	For if ye turn again unto the 
2CH.30.10	So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
2CH.30.11	Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
2CH.30.12	Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the 
2CH.30.13	And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.
2CH.30.14	And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.
2CH.30.15	Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the 
2CH.30.16	And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.
2CH.30.17	For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the 
2CH.30.18	For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good 
2CH.30.19	That prepareth his heart to seek God, the 
2CH.30.20	And the 
2CH.30.21	And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the 
2CH.30.22	And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the 
2CH.30.23	And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.
2CH.30.24	For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
2CH.30.25	And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
2CH.30.26	So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.
2CH.30.27	Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.
2CH.31.1	Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
2CH.31.2	And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the 
2CH.31.3	He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the 
2CH.31.4	Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the 
2CH.31.5	And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.
2CH.31.6	And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the 
2CH.31.7	In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
2CH.31.8	And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the 
2CH.31.9	Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
2CH.31.10	And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the 
2CH.31.11	Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the 
2CH.31.12	And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.
2CH.31.13	And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
2CH.31.14	And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the 
2CH.31.15	And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:
2CH.31.16	Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of the 
2CH.31.17	Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;
2CH.31.18	And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:
2CH.31.19	Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.
2CH.31.20	And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the 
2CH.31.21	And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.
2CH.32.1	After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.
2CH.32.2	And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
2CH.32.3	He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him.
2CH.32.4	So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?
2CH.32.5	Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.
2CH.32.6	And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,
2CH.32.7	Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him:
2CH.32.8	With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the 
2CH.32.9	After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,
2CH.32.10	Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?
2CH.32.11	Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The 
2CH.32.12	Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?
2CH.32.13	Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?
2CH.32.14	Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?
2CH.32.15	Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?
2CH.32.16	And his servants spake yet more against the 
2CH.32.17	He wrote also letters to rail on the 
2CH.32.18	Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.
2CH.32.19	And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.
2CH.32.20	And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.
2CH.32.21	And the 
2CH.32.22	Thus the 
2CH.32.23	And many brought gifts unto the 
2CH.32.24	In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the 
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
2CH.32.26	Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the 
2CH.32.27	And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;
2CH.32.28	Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.
2CH.32.29	Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.
2CH.32.30	This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
2CH.32.31	Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.
2CH.32.32	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2CH.32.33	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:
2CH.33.2	But did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.3	For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
2CH.33.4	Also he built altars in the house of the 
2CH.33.5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the 
2CH.33.6	And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.7	And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
2CH.33.8	Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.
2CH.33.9	So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the 
2CH.33.10	And the 
2CH.33.11	Wherefore the 
2CH.33.12	And when he was in affliction, he besought the 
2CH.33.13	And prayed unto him: and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the 
2CH.33.14	Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.
2CH.33.15	And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the 
2CH.33.16	And he repaired the altar of the 
2CH.33.17	Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the 
2CH.33.18	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the 
2CH.33.19	His prayer also, and how God was entreated of him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.
2CH.33.20	So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.33.21	Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.
2CH.33.22	But he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.23	And humbled not himself before the 
2CH.33.24	And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.
2CH.33.25	But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
2CH.34.1	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.
2CH.34.2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.34.3	For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.
2CH.34.4	And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.
2CH.34.5	And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
2CH.34.6	And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.
2CH.34.7	And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.8	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the 
2CH.34.9	And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.10	And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the 
2CH.34.11	Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
2CH.34.12	And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.
2CH.34.13	Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
2CH.34.14	And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the 
2CH.34.15	And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the 
2CH.34.16	And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.
2CH.34.17	And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the 
2CH.34.18	Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
2CH.34.19	And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.
2CH.34.20	And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,
2CH.34.21	Go, enquire of the 
2CH.34.22	And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect.
2CH.34.23	And she answered them, Thus saith the 
2CH.34.24	Thus saith the 
2CH.34.25	Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.
2CH.34.26	And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the 
2CH.34.27	Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the 
2CH.34.28	Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.
2CH.34.29	Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2CH.34.30	And the king went up into the house of the 
2CH.34.31	And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the 
2CH.34.32	And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
2CH.34.33	And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the 
2CH.35.1	Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the 
2CH.35.2	And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the 
2CH.35.3	And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the 
2CH.35.4	And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.
2CH.35.5	And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.
2CH.35.6	So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the 
2CH.35.7	And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.
2CH.35.8	And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.
2CH.35.9	Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.
2CH.35.10	So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.
2CH.35.11	And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.
2CH.35.12	And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the 
2CH.35.13	And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.
2CH.35.14	And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
2CH.35.15	And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
2CH.35.16	So all the service of the 
2CH.35.17	And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
2CH.35.18	And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
2CH.35.19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.
2CH.35.20	After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.
2CH.35.21	But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.
2CH.35.22	Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
2CH.35.23	And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.
2CH.35.24	His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
2CH.35.25	And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.
2CH.35.26	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the 
2CH.35.27	And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2CH.36.1	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.
2CH.36.2	Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
2CH.36.3	And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
2CH.36.4	And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Neco took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
2CH.36.5	Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.6	Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the 
2CH.36.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.10	And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the 
2CH.36.11	Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
2CH.36.12	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.13	And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the 
2CH.36.14	Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the 
2CH.36.15	And the 
2CH.36.16	But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the 
2CH.36.17	Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand.
2CH.36.18	And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.36.19	And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.
2CH.36.20	And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:
2CH.36.21	To fulfil the word of the 
2CH.36.22	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the 
2CH.36.23	Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the 
EZR.1.1	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the 
EZR.1.2	Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The 
EZR.1.3	Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the 
EZR.1.4	And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.
EZR.1.5	Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the 
EZR.1.6	And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.
EZR.1.7	Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the 
EZR.1.8	Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
EZR.1.9	And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,
EZR.1.10	Thirty basins of gold, silver basins of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.
EZR.1.11	All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.
EZR.2.1	Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city;
EZR.2.2	Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

EZR.2.57	The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Ami.
EZR.2.58	All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two.
EZR.2.59	And these were they which went up from Tel–melah, Tel–harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:
EZR.2.60	The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.
EZR.2.61	And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name:
EZR.2.62	These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
EZR.2.63	And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
EZR.2.64	The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,
EZR.2.65	Beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women.
EZR.2.66	Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;
EZR.2.67	Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
EZR.2.68	And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the 
EZR.2.69	They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.
EZR.2.70	So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
EZR.3.1	And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.
EZR.3.2	Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
EZR.3.3	And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the 
EZR.3.4	They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;
EZR.3.5	And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the 
EZR.3.6	From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the 
EZR.3.7	They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
EZR.3.8	Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the 
EZR.3.9	Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.
EZR.3.10	And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the 
EZR.3.11	And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the 
EZR.3.12	But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:
EZR.3.13	So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
EZR.4.1	Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the 
EZR.4.2	Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar–haddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the 
EZR.4.4	Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
EZR.4.5	And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
EZR.4.6	And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.4.7	And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.
EZR.4.8	Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:
EZR.4.9	Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,
EZR.4.10	And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.
EZR.4.11	This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.
EZR.4.12	Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.
EZR.4.13	Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.
EZR.4.14	Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
EZR.4.15	That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.
EZR.4.16	We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.
EZR.4.17	Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.
EZR.4.18	The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.
EZR.4.19	And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.
EZR.4.20	There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.
EZR.4.21	Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me.
EZR.4.22	Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
EZR.4.23	Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.
EZR.4.24	Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
EZR.5.1	Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.
EZR.5.2	Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.
EZR.5.3	At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar–bozenai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?
EZR.5.4	Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?
EZR.5.5	But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.
EZR.5.6	The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar–bozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:
EZR.5.7	They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace.
EZR.5.8	Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.
EZR.5.9	Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?
EZR.5.10	We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.
EZR.5.11	And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.
EZR.5.12	But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.
EZR.5.13	But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.
EZR.5.14	And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
EZR.5.15	And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.
EZR.5.16	Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.
EZR.5.17	Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
EZR.6.1	Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.
EZR.6.2	And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:
EZR.6.3	In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;
EZR.6.4	With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:
EZR.6.5	And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God.
EZR.6.6	Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar–bozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:
EZR.6.7	Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.
EZR.6.8	Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.
EZR.6.9	And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:
EZR.6.10	That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
EZR.6.11	Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.
EZR.6.12	And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.
EZR.6.13	Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar–bozenai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily.
EZR.6.14	And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
EZR.6.15	And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
EZR.6.16	And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,
EZR.6.17	And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
EZR.6.18	And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.
EZR.6.19	And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month.
EZR.6.20	For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
EZR.6.21	And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the 
EZR.6.22	And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the 
EZR.7.1	Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
EZR.7.2	The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
EZR.7.3	The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
EZR.7.4	The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
EZR.7.5	The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest:
EZR.7.6	This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the 
EZR.7.7	And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.
EZR.7.8	And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
EZR.7.9	For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
EZR.7.10	For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the 
EZR.7.11	Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the 
EZR.7.12	Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time.
EZR.7.13	I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.
EZR.7.14	Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand;
EZR.7.15	And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,
EZR.7.16	And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem:
EZR.7.17	That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.
EZR.7.18	And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God.
EZR.7.19	The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.
EZR.7.20	And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house.
EZR.7.21	And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily,
EZR.7.22	Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.
EZR.7.23	Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
EZR.7.24	Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.
EZR.7.25	And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.
EZR.7.26	And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
EZR.7.27	Blessed be the 
EZR.7.28	And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the 
EZR.8.1	These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king.
EZR.8.2	Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush.
EZR.8.3	Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Parosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty.
EZR.8.4	Of the sons of Pahath–moab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.
EZR.8.5	Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males.
EZR.8.6	Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.
EZR.8.7	And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.
EZR.8.8	And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him fourscore males.
EZR.8.9	Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males.
EZR.8.10	And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an hundred and threescore males.
EZR.8.11	And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males.
EZR.8.12	And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an hundred and ten males.
EZR.8.13	And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males.
EZR.8.14	Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.
EZR.8.15	And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.
EZR.8.16	Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.
EZR.8.17	And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.
EZR.8.18	And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
EZR.8.19	And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;
EZR.8.20	Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.
EZR.8.21	Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
EZR.8.22	For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.
EZR.8.24	Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
EZR.8.25	And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:
EZR.8.26	I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents;
EZR.8.27	Also twenty basins of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.
EZR.8.28	And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the 
EZR.8.29	Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the 
EZR.8.30	So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
EZR.8.31	Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
EZR.8.32	And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
EZR.8.33	Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;
EZR.8.34	By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.
EZR.8.35	Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the 
EZR.8.36	And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.
EZR.9.1	Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
EZR.9.2	For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.
EZR.9.3	And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonished.
EZR.9.4	Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice.
EZR.9.5	And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the 
EZR.9.6	And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.
EZR.9.7	Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.
EZR.9.8	And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the 
EZR.9.9	For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
EZR.9.10	And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
EZR.9.11	Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.
EZR.9.12	Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.
EZR.9.13	And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;
EZR.9.14	Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?
EZR.9.15	O 
EZR.10.1	Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.
EZR.10.2	And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.
EZR.10.3	Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
EZR.10.4	Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it.
EZR.10.5	Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.
EZR.10.6	Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.
EZR.10.7	And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;
EZR.10.8	And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
EZR.10.9	Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.
EZR.10.10	And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.
EZR.10.11	Now therefore make confession unto the 
EZR.10.12	Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.
EZR.10.13	But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
EZR.10.14	Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.
EZR.10.15	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
EZR.10.16	And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
EZR.10.17	And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.
EZR.10.18	And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
EZR.10.19	And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.
EZR.10.20	And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.
EZR.10.21	And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah.
EZR.10.22	And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
EZR.10.23	Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
EZR.10.24	Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.
EZR.10.25	Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.
EZR.10.26	And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Elijah.
EZR.10.27	And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.
EZR.10.28	Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai.
EZR.10.29	And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.
EZR.10.30	And of the sons of Pahath–moab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.
EZR.10.31	And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
EZR.10.32	Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.
EZR.10.33	Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.
EZR.10.34	Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,
EZR.10.35	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,
EZR.10.36	Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
EZR.10.37	Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau,
EZR.10.38	And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,
EZR.10.39	And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,
EZR.10.40	Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
EZR.10.41	Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,
EZR.10.42	Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.
EZR.10.43	Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, and Joel, Benaiah.
EZR.10.44	All these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives by whom they had children.
NEH.1.1	The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
NEH.1.2	That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
NEH.1.3	And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.
NEH.1.4	And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,
NEH.1.5	And said, I beseech thee, O 
NEH.1.6	Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.
NEH.1.7	We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
NEH.1.8	Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
NEH.1.9	But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
NEH.1.10	Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
NEH.1.11	O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.
NEH.2.1	And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.
NEH.2.2	Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,
NEH.2.3	And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?
NEH.2.4	Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
NEH.2.5	And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.
NEH.2.6	And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
NEH.2.7	Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;
NEH.2.8	And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
NEH.2.9	Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
NEH.2.10	When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
NEH.2.11	So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
NEH.2.12	And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.
NEH.2.13	And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.
NEH.2.14	Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.
NEH.2.15	Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.
NEH.2.16	And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
NEH.2.17	Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.
NEH.2.18	Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.
NEH.2.19	But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?
NEH.2.20	Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.
NEH.3.1	Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.
NEH.3.2	And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.
NEH.3.3	But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.
NEH.3.4	And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baanah.
NEH.3.5	And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord.
NEH.3.6	Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.
NEH.3.7	And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the governor on this side the river.
NEH.3.8	Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall.
NEH.3.9	And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem.
NEH.3.10	And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah.
NEH.3.11	Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahath–moab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.
NEH.3.12	And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.
NEH.3.13	The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate.
NEH.3.14	But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Beth–haccerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.
NEH.3.15	But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Col–hozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city of David.
NEH.3.16	After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Beth–zur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty.
NEH.3.17	After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his part.
NEH.3.18	After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the half part of Keilah.
NEH.3.19	And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall.
NEH.3.20	After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
NEH.3.21	After him repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib.
NEH.3.22	And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.
NEH.3.23	After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their house. After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by his house.
NEH.3.24	After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even unto the corner.
NEH.3.25	Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall, and the tower which lieth out from the king's high house, that was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh.
NEH.3.26	Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out.
NEH.3.27	After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel.
NEH.3.28	From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house.
NEH.3.29	After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate.
NEH.3.30	After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber.
NEH.3.31	After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner.
NEH.3.32	And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.
NEH.4.1	But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.
NEH.4.2	And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?
NEH.4.3	Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.
NEH.4.4	Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:
NEH.4.5	And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.
NEH.4.6	So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
NEH.4.7	But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,
NEH.4.8	And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.
NEH.4.9	Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
NEH.4.10	And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.
NEH.4.11	And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
NEH.4.12	And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you.
NEH.4.13	Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
NEH.4.14	And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
NEH.4.15	And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.
NEH.4.16	And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.
NEH.4.17	They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.
NEH.4.18	For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.
NEH.4.19	And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.
NEH.4.20	In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.
NEH.4.21	So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
NEH.4.22	Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.
NEH.4.23	So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.
NEH.5.1	And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
NEH.5.2	For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.
NEH.5.3	Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.
NEH.5.4	There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.
NEH.5.5	Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.
NEH.5.6	And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
NEH.5.7	Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.
NEH.5.8	And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.
NEH.5.9	Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?
NEH.5.10	I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
NEH.5.11	Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.
NEH.5.12	Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.
NEH.5.13	Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the 
NEH.5.14	Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.
NEH.5.15	But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.
NEH.5.16	Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.
NEH.5.17	Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us.
NEH.5.18	Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
NEH.5.19	Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.
NEH.6.1	Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)
NEH.6.2	That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
NEH.6.3	And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?
NEH.6.4	Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
NEH.6.5	Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
NEH.6.6	Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.
NEH.6.7	And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
NEH.6.8	Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.
NEH.6.9	For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.
NEH.6.10	Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
NEH.6.11	And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
NEH.6.12	And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
NEH.6.13	Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
NEH.6.14	My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
NEH.6.15	So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.
NEH.6.16	And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.
NEH.6.17	Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.
NEH.6.18	For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
NEH.6.19	Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
NEH.7.1	Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
NEH.7.2	That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.
NEH.7.3	And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.
NEH.7.4	Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.
NEH.7.5	And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,
NEH.7.6	These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;

NEH.7.58	The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,
NEH.7.59	The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon.
NEH.7.60	All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two.
NEH.7.61	And these were they which went up also from Tel–melah, Tel–harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel.
NEH.7.62	The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.
NEH.7.63	And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai, which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name.
NEH.7.64	These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
NEH.7.65	And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.
NEH.7.66	The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,
NEH.7.67	Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.
NEH.7.68	Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two hundred forty and five:
NEH.7.69	Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses.
NEH.7.70	And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.
NEH.7.71	And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver.
NEH.7.72	And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and threescore and seven priests' garments.
NEH.7.73	So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities.
NEH.8.1	And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the 
NEH.8.2	And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.
NEH.8.3	And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.
NEH.8.4	And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
NEH.8.5	And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:
NEH.8.6	And Ezra blessed the 
NEH.8.7	Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.
NEH.8.8	So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.
NEH.8.9	And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the 
NEH.8.10	Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the 
NEH.8.11	So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.
NEH.8.12	And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.
NEH.8.13	And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.
NEH.8.14	And they found written in the law which the 
NEH.8.15	And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.
NEH.8.16	So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.
NEH.8.17	And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.
NEH.8.18	Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.
NEH.9.1	Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.
NEH.9.2	And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
NEH.9.3	And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the 
NEH.9.4	Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the 
NEH.9.5	Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the 
NEH.9.6	Thou, even thou, art 
NEH.9.7	Thou art the 
NEH.9.8	And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:
NEH.9.9	And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;
NEH.9.10	And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day.
NEH.9.11	And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.
NEH.9.12	Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.
NEH.9.13	Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:
NEH.9.14	And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:
NEH.9.15	And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.
NEH.9.16	But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,
NEH.9.17	And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.
NEH.9.18	Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;
NEH.9.19	Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.
NEH.9.20	Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.
NEH.9.21	Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.
NEH.9.22	Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.
NEH.9.23	Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.
NEH.9.24	So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
NEH.9.25	And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
NEH.9.26	Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.
NEH.9.27	Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.
NEH.9.28	But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;
NEH.9.29	And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
NEH.9.30	Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.
NEH.9.31	Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.
NEH.9.32	Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.
NEH.9.33	Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:
NEH.9.34	Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.
NEH.9.35	For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.
NEH.9.36	Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:
NEH.9.37	And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.
NEH.9.38	And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.
NEH.10.1	Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,
NEH.10.2	Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
NEH.10.3	Pashur, Amariah, Malchijah,

NEH.10.8	Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these were the priests.
NEH.10.9	And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;
NEH.10.10	And their brethren, Shebaniah, Hodijah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,

NEH.10.23	Hoshea, Hananiah, Hashub,
NEH.10.24	Hallohesh, Pileha, Shobek,
NEH.10.25	Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
NEH.10.26	And Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,
NEH.10.27	Malluch, Harim, Baanah.
NEH.10.28	And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one having knowledge, and having understanding;
NEH.10.29	They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the 
NEH.10.30	And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons:
NEH.10.31	And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.
NEH.10.32	Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;
NEH.10.33	For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.
NEH.10.34	And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon the altar of the 
NEH.10.35	And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the 
NEH.10.36	Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God:
NEH.10.37	And that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.
NEH.10.38	And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure house.
NEH.10.39	For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God.
NEH.11.1	And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other cities.
NEH.11.2	And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.
NEH.11.3	Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants.
NEH.11.4	And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah; Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalaleel, of the children of Perez;
NEH.11.5	And Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col–hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of Shiloni.

NEH.11.11	Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the ruler of the house of God.

NEH.11.16	And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites, had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God.

NEH.11.18	All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four.
NEH.11.19	Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that kept the gates, were an hundred seventy and two.
NEH.11.20	And the residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.
NEH.11.21	But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over the Nethinims.
NEH.11.22	The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica. Of the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the business of the house of God.
NEH.11.23	For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day.
NEH.11.24	And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people.
NEH.11.25	And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjath–arba, and in the villages thereof, and at Dibon, and in the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel, and in the villages thereof,
NEH.11.26	And at Jeshua, and at Moladah, and at Beth–pelet,

NEH.11.30	Zanoah, Adullam, and in their villages, at Lachish, and the fields thereof, at Azekah, and in the villages thereof. And they dwelt from Beer–sheba unto the valley of Hinnom.
NEH.11.31	The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash, and Aija, and Beth–el, and in their villages,

NEH.11.35	Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.
NEH.11.36	And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin.

NEH.12.7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chief of the priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.
NEH.12.8	Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, which was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren.
NEH.12.9	Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against them in the watches.
NEH.12.10	And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,
NEH.12.11	And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.
NEH.12.12	And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
NEH.12.13	Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
NEH.12.14	Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
NEH.12.15	Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
NEH.12.16	Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
NEH.12.17	Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;
NEH.12.18	Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jonathan;
NEH.12.19	And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
NEH.12.20	Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
NEH.12.21	Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.
NEH.12.22	The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the reign of Darius the Persian.
NEH.12.23	The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
NEH.12.24	And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.
NEH.12.25	Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.
NEH.12.26	These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
NEH.12.27	And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
NEH.12.28	And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;
NEH.12.29	Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.
NEH.12.30	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
NEH.12.31	Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:
NEH.12.32	And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
NEH.12.33	And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
NEH.12.34	Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
NEH.12.35	And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:
NEH.12.36	And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.
NEH.12.37	And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.
NEH.12.38	And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall;
NEH.12.39	And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.
NEH.12.40	So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:
NEH.12.41	And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
NEH.12.42	And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.
NEH.12.43	Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
NEH.12.44	And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
NEH.12.45	And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.
NEH.12.46	For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.
NEH.12.47	And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.
NEH.13.1	On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;
NEH.13.2	Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.
NEH.13.3	Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
NEH.13.4	And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:
NEH.13.5	And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.
NEH.13.6	But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:
NEH.13.7	And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
NEH.13.8	And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
NEH.13.9	Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.
NEH.13.10	And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.
NEH.13.11	Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
NEH.13.12	Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
NEH.13.13	And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.
NEH.13.14	Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.
NEH.13.15	In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.
NEH.13.16	There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
NEH.13.17	Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?
NEH.13.18	Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
NEH.13.19	And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
NEH.13.20	So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
NEH.13.21	Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.
NEH.13.22	And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.
NEH.13.23	In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:
NEH.13.24	And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.
NEH.13.25	And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.
NEH.13.26	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.
NEH.13.27	Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?
NEH.13.28	And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.
NEH.13.29	Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
NEH.13.30	Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;
NEH.13.31	And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
EST.1.1	Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)
EST.1.2	That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,
EST.1.3	In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:
EST.1.4	When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.
EST.1.5	And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;
EST.1.6	Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.
EST.1.7	And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.
EST.1.8	And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.
EST.1.9	Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
EST.1.10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
EST.1.11	To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.
EST.1.12	But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.
EST.1.13	Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:
EST.1.14	And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)
EST.1.15	What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
EST.1.16	And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
EST.1.17	For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.
EST.1.18	Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.
EST.1.19	If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.
EST.1.20	And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.
EST.1.21	And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
EST.1.22	For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.
EST.2.1	After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
EST.2.2	Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:
EST.2.3	And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:
EST.2.4	And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
EST.2.5	Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;
EST.2.6	Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
EST.2.7	And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.
EST.2.8	So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
EST.2.9	And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.
EST.2.10	Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.
EST.2.11	And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.
EST.2.12	Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)
EST.2.13	Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.
EST.2.14	In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.
EST.2.15	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
EST.2.16	So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
EST.2.17	And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
EST.2.18	Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.
EST.2.19	And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.
EST.2.20	Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.
EST.2.21	In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
EST.2.22	And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.
EST.2.23	And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
EST.3.1	After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.
EST.3.2	And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.
EST.3.3	Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?
EST.3.4	Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.
EST.3.5	And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
EST.3.6	And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.
EST.3.7	In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.
EST.3.8	And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.
EST.3.9	If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.
EST.3.10	And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.
EST.3.11	And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
EST.3.12	Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.
EST.3.13	And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.
EST.3.14	The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.
EST.3.15	The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.
EST.4.1	When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
EST.4.2	And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
EST.4.3	And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
EST.4.4	So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.
EST.4.5	Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.
EST.4.6	So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.
EST.4.7	And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
EST.4.8	Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.
EST.4.9	And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
EST.4.10	Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;
EST.4.11	All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.
EST.4.12	And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.
EST.4.13	Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.
EST.4.14	For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
EST.4.15	Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,
EST.4.16	Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.
EST.4.17	So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
EST.5.1	Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.
EST.5.2	And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.
EST.5.3	Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.
EST.5.4	And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.
EST.5.5	Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
EST.5.6	And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
EST.5.7	Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;
EST.5.8	If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.
EST.5.9	Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.
EST.5.10	Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.
EST.5.11	And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
EST.5.12	Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.
EST.5.13	Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.
EST.5.14	Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.
EST.6.1	On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.
EST.6.2	And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
EST.6.3	And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.
EST.6.4	And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
EST.6.5	And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
EST.6.6	So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?
EST.6.7	And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,
EST.6.8	Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:
EST.6.9	And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.
EST.6.10	Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.
EST.6.11	Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.
EST.6.12	And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.
EST.6.13	And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.
EST.6.14	And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.
EST.7.1	So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
EST.7.2	And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.
EST.7.3	Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:
EST.7.4	For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.
EST.7.5	Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?
EST.7.6	And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
EST.7.7	And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
EST.7.8	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
EST.7.9	And Harbona, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.
EST.7.10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.
EST.8.1	On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.
EST.8.2	And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
EST.8.3	And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.
EST.8.4	Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,
EST.8.5	And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces:
EST.8.6	For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
EST.8.7	Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.
EST.8.8	Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.
EST.8.9	Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
EST.8.10	And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:
EST.8.11	Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,
EST.8.12	Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
EST.8.13	The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
EST.8.14	So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.
EST.8.15	And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.
EST.8.16	The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.
EST.8.17	And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.
EST.9.1	Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)
EST.9.2	The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.
EST.9.3	And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.
EST.9.4	For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.
EST.9.5	Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.
EST.9.6	And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
EST.9.7	And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
EST.9.8	And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
EST.9.9	And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
EST.9.10	The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.
EST.9.11	On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
EST.9.12	And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.
EST.9.13	Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.
EST.9.14	And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.
EST.9.15	For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.
EST.9.16	But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,
EST.9.17	On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
EST.9.18	But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
EST.9.19	Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.
EST.9.20	And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,
EST.9.21	To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
EST.9.22	As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
EST.9.23	And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;
EST.9.24	Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;
EST.9.25	But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
EST.9.26	Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,
EST.9.27	The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;
EST.9.28	And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.
EST.9.29	Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.
EST.9.30	And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
EST.9.31	To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.
EST.9.32	And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
EST.10.1	And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea.
EST.10.2	And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
EST.10.3	For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.
JOB.1.1	There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.
JOB.1.2	And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
JOB.1.3	His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
JOB.1.4	And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
JOB.1.5	And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
JOB.1.6	Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the 
JOB.1.7	And the 
JOB.1.8	And the 
JOB.1.9	Then Satan answered the 
JOB.1.10	Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
JOB.1.11	But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
JOB.1.12	And the 
JOB.1.13	And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
JOB.1.14	And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
JOB.1.15	And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
JOB.1.16	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
JOB.1.17	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
JOB.1.18	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
JOB.1.19	And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
JOB.1.20	Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,
JOB.1.21	And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the 
JOB.1.22	In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
JOB.2.1	Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the 
JOB.2.2	And the 
JOB.2.3	And the 
JOB.2.4	And Satan answered the 
JOB.2.5	But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
JOB.2.6	And the 
JOB.2.7	So went Satan forth from the presence of the 
JOB.2.8	And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.
JOB.2.9	Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.
JOB.2.10	But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
JOB.2.11	Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.
JOB.2.12	And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
JOB.2.13	So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.
JOB.3.1	After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
JOB.3.2	And Job spake, and said,
JOB.3.3	Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.
JOB.3.4	Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.
JOB.3.5	Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
JOB.3.6	As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
JOB.3.7	Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
JOB.3.8	Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
JOB.3.9	Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:
JOB.3.10	Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
JOB.3.11	Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
JOB.3.12	Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
JOB.3.13	For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
JOB.3.14	With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;
JOB.3.15	Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:
JOB.3.16	Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.
JOB.3.17	There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
JOB.3.18	There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
JOB.3.19	The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
JOB.3.20	Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;
JOB.3.21	Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
JOB.3.22	Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?
JOB.3.23	Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
JOB.3.24	For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
JOB.3.25	For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
JOB.3.26	I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
JOB.4.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
JOB.4.2	If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?
JOB.4.3	Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
JOB.4.4	Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
JOB.4.5	But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
JOB.4.6	Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
JOB.4.7	Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
JOB.4.8	Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
JOB.4.9	By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
JOB.4.10	The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
JOB.4.11	The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
JOB.4.12	Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
JOB.4.13	In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,
JOB.4.14	Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
JOB.4.15	Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
JOB.4.16	It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
JOB.4.17	Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
JOB.4.18	Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
JOB.4.19	How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?
JOB.4.20	They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.
JOB.4.21	Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.
JOB.5.1	Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
JOB.5.2	For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
JOB.5.3	I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
JOB.5.4	His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.
JOB.5.5	Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
JOB.5.6	Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
JOB.5.7	Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
JOB.5.8	I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:
JOB.5.9	Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:
JOB.5.10	Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:
JOB.5.11	To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
JOB.5.12	He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
JOB.5.13	He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
JOB.5.14	They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.
JOB.5.15	But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
JOB.5.16	So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
JOB.5.17	Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
JOB.5.18	For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
JOB.5.19	He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
JOB.5.20	In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
JOB.5.21	Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
JOB.5.22	At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
JOB.5.23	For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
JOB.5.24	And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
JOB.5.25	Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
JOB.5.26	Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
JOB.5.27	Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
JOB.6.1	But Job answered and said,
JOB.6.2	Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
JOB.6.3	For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.
JOB.6.4	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
JOB.6.5	Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
JOB.6.6	Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
JOB.6.7	The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.
JOB.6.8	Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
JOB.6.9	Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
JOB.6.10	Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
JOB.6.11	What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?
JOB.6.12	Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
JOB.6.13	Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
JOB.6.14	To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
JOB.6.15	My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;
JOB.6.16	Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:
JOB.6.17	What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
JOB.6.18	The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
JOB.6.19	The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
JOB.6.20	They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
JOB.6.21	For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
JOB.6.22	Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?
JOB.6.23	Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
JOB.6.24	Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
JOB.6.25	How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
JOB.6.26	Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?
JOB.6.27	Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.
JOB.6.28	Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.
JOB.6.29	Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.
JOB.6.30	Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
JOB.7.1	Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?
JOB.7.2	As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:
JOB.7.3	So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
JOB.7.4	When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
JOB.7.5	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.
JOB.7.6	My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.
JOB.7.7	O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.
JOB.7.8	The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.
JOB.7.9	As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.
JOB.7.10	He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.
JOB.7.11	Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.7.12	Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
JOB.7.13	When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;
JOB.7.14	Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:
JOB.7.15	So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.
JOB.7.16	I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.
JOB.7.17	What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
JOB.7.18	And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?
JOB.7.19	How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
JOB.7.20	I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
JOB.7.21	And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.
JOB.8.1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
JOB.8.2	How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
JOB.8.3	Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
JOB.8.4	If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;
JOB.8.5	If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
JOB.8.6	If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
JOB.8.7	Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
JOB.8.8	For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:
JOB.8.9	(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)
JOB.8.10	Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?
JOB.8.11	Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?
JOB.8.12	Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.
JOB.8.13	So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:
JOB.8.14	Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.
JOB.8.15	He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
JOB.8.16	He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
JOB.8.17	His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.
JOB.8.18	If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
JOB.8.19	Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
JOB.8.20	Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:
JOB.8.21	Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.
JOB.8.22	They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
JOB.9.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.9.2	I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?
JOB.9.3	If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
JOB.9.4	He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?
JOB.9.5	Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.
JOB.9.6	Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.
JOB.9.7	Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.
JOB.9.8	Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
JOB.9.9	Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.
JOB.9.10	Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.
JOB.9.11	Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
JOB.9.12	Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?
JOB.9.13	If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.
JOB.9.14	How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?
JOB.9.15	Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.
JOB.9.16	If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.
JOB.9.17	For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
JOB.9.18	He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.
JOB.9.19	If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?
JOB.9.20	If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.
JOB.9.21	Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.
JOB.9.22	This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
JOB.9.23	If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.
JOB.9.24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?
JOB.9.25	Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.
JOB.9.26	They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.
JOB.9.27	If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:
JOB.9.28	I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
JOB.9.29	If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?
JOB.9.30	If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;
JOB.9.31	Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.
JOB.9.32	For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.
JOB.9.33	Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.
JOB.9.34	Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:
JOB.9.35	Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.
JOB.10.1	My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.10.2	I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.
JOB.10.3	Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
JOB.10.4	Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?
JOB.10.5	Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,
JOB.10.6	That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?
JOB.10.7	Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.
JOB.10.8	Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.
JOB.10.9	Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?
JOB.10.10	Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?
JOB.10.11	Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
JOB.10.12	Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
JOB.10.13	And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.
JOB.10.14	If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
JOB.10.15	If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;
JOB.10.16	For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.
JOB.10.17	Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.
JOB.10.18	Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!
JOB.10.19	I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
JOB.10.20	Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
JOB.10.21	Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;
JOB.10.22	A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.
JOB.11.1	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
JOB.11.2	Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
JOB.11.3	Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
JOB.11.4	For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.
JOB.11.5	But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;
JOB.11.6	And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.
JOB.11.7	Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
JOB.11.8	It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
JOB.11.9	The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
JOB.11.10	If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?
JOB.11.11	For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?
JOB.11.12	For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.
JOB.11.13	If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;
JOB.11.14	If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
JOB.11.15	For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
JOB.11.16	Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:
JOB.11.17	And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
JOB.11.18	And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.
JOB.11.19	Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
JOB.11.20	But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.
JOB.12.1	And Job answered and said,
JOB.12.2	No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
JOB.12.3	But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
JOB.12.4	I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.
JOB.12.5	He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
JOB.12.6	The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.
JOB.12.7	But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:
JOB.12.8	Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
JOB.12.9	Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the 
JOB.12.10	In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.
JOB.12.11	Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?
JOB.12.12	With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
JOB.12.13	With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.
JOB.12.14	Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
JOB.12.15	Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
JOB.12.16	With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.
JOB.12.17	He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.
JOB.12.18	He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.
JOB.12.19	He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.
JOB.12.20	He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.
JOB.12.21	He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.
JOB.12.22	He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
JOB.12.23	He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.
JOB.12.24	He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
JOB.12.25	They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
JOB.13.1	Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.
JOB.13.2	What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.
JOB.13.3	Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.
JOB.13.4	But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.
JOB.13.5	O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.
JOB.13.6	Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
JOB.13.7	Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
JOB.13.8	Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
JOB.13.9	Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?
JOB.13.10	He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.
JOB.13.11	Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
JOB.13.12	Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
JOB.13.13	Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.
JOB.13.14	Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?
JOB.13.15	Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.
JOB.13.16	He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
JOB.13.17	Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
JOB.13.18	Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.
JOB.13.19	Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.
JOB.13.20	Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
JOB.13.21	Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
JOB.13.22	Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.
JOB.13.23	How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
JOB.13.24	Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?
JOB.13.25	Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
JOB.13.26	For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
JOB.13.27	Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
JOB.13.28	And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
JOB.14.1	Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.
JOB.14.2	He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
JOB.14.3	And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?
JOB.14.4	Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
JOB.14.5	Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
JOB.14.6	Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.
JOB.14.7	For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
JOB.14.8	Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;
JOB.14.9	Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.
JOB.14.10	But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?
JOB.14.11	As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:
JOB.14.12	So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.
JOB.14.13	O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
JOB.14.14	If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.
JOB.14.15	Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.
JOB.14.16	For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?
JOB.14.17	My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.
JOB.14.18	And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.
JOB.14.19	The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.
JOB.14.20	Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
JOB.14.21	His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
JOB.14.22	But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.
JOB.15.1	Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
JOB.15.2	Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?
JOB.15.3	Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
JOB.15.4	Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.
JOB.15.5	For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
JOB.15.6	Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
JOB.15.7	Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?
JOB.15.8	Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
JOB.15.9	What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?
JOB.15.10	With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.
JOB.15.11	Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?
JOB.15.12	Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,
JOB.15.13	That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?
JOB.15.14	What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
JOB.15.15	Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
JOB.15.16	How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?
JOB.15.17	I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;
JOB.15.18	Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:
JOB.15.19	Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
JOB.15.20	The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
JOB.15.21	A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
JOB.15.22	He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.
JOB.15.23	He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
JOB.15.24	Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
JOB.15.25	For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.
JOB.15.26	He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:
JOB.15.27	Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.
JOB.15.28	And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.
JOB.15.29	He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.
JOB.15.30	He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
JOB.15.31	Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.
JOB.15.32	It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
JOB.15.33	He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
JOB.15.34	For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
JOB.15.35	They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
JOB.16.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.16.2	I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.
JOB.16.3	Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
JOB.16.4	I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.
JOB.16.5	But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief.
JOB.16.6	Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?
JOB.16.7	But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.
JOB.16.8	And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
JOB.16.9	He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
JOB.16.10	They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.
JOB.16.11	God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
JOB.16.12	I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.
JOB.16.13	His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.
JOB.16.14	He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.
JOB.16.15	I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.
JOB.16.16	My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
JOB.16.17	Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.
JOB.16.18	O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
JOB.16.19	Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.
JOB.16.20	My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.
JOB.16.21	O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!
JOB.16.22	When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
JOB.17.1	My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.
JOB.17.2	Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?
JOB.17.3	Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?
JOB.17.4	For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
JOB.17.5	He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
JOB.17.6	He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.
JOB.17.7	Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.
JOB.17.8	Upright men shall be astonished at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
JOB.17.9	The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
JOB.17.10	But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.
JOB.17.11	My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.
JOB.17.12	They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.
JOB.17.13	If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.
JOB.17.14	I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.
JOB.17.15	And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
JOB.17.16	They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.
JOB.18.1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
JOB.18.2	How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.
JOB.18.3	Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?
JOB.18.4	He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?
JOB.18.5	Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
JOB.18.6	The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.
JOB.18.7	The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
JOB.18.8	For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.
JOB.18.9	The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.
JOB.18.10	The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.
JOB.18.11	Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.
JOB.18.12	His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.
JOB.18.13	It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.
JOB.18.14	His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.
JOB.18.15	It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
JOB.18.16	His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.
JOB.18.17	His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.
JOB.18.18	He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.
JOB.18.19	He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.
JOB.18.20	They that come after him shall be astonished at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.
JOB.18.21	Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
JOB.19.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.19.2	How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?
JOB.19.3	These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.
JOB.19.4	And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.
JOB.19.5	If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:
JOB.19.6	Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.
JOB.19.7	Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.
JOB.19.8	He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.
JOB.19.9	He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.
JOB.19.10	He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.
JOB.19.11	He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.
JOB.19.12	His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.
JOB.19.13	He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
JOB.19.14	My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.
JOB.19.16	I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I entreated him with my mouth.
JOB.19.17	My breath is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the children's sake of mine own body.
JOB.19.18	Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.
JOB.19.19	All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.
JOB.19.20	My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
JOB.19.21	Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.
JOB.19.22	Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
JOB.19.23	Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!
JOB.19.24	That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!
JOB.19.25	For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:
JOB.19.26	And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:
JOB.19.27	Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.
JOB.19.28	But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
JOB.19.29	Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.
JOB.20.1	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
JOB.20.2	Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.
JOB.20.3	I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
JOB.20.4	Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
JOB.20.5	That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?
JOB.20.6	Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;
JOB.20.7	Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?
JOB.20.8	He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
JOB.20.9	The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
JOB.20.10	His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.
JOB.20.11	His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.
JOB.20.12	Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;
JOB.20.13	Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:
JOB.20.14	Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.
JOB.20.15	He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.
JOB.20.16	He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.
JOB.20.17	He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.
JOB.20.18	That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.
JOB.20.19	Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;
JOB.20.20	Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.
JOB.20.21	There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
JOB.20.22	In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
JOB.20.23	When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.
JOB.20.24	He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.
JOB.20.25	It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.
JOB.20.26	All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
JOB.20.27	The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
JOB.20.28	The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
JOB.20.29	This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
JOB.21.1	But Job answered and said,
JOB.21.2	Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.
JOB.21.3	Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.
JOB.21.4	As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?
JOB.21.5	Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.
JOB.21.6	Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
JOB.21.7	Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?
JOB.21.8	Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
JOB.21.9	Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.
JOB.21.10	Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
JOB.21.11	They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
JOB.21.12	They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
JOB.21.13	They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.
JOB.21.14	Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
JOB.21.15	What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
JOB.21.16	Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.21.17	How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.
JOB.21.18	They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.
JOB.21.19	God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.
JOB.21.20	His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
JOB.21.21	For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
JOB.21.22	Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
JOB.21.23	One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
JOB.21.24	His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
JOB.21.25	And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.
JOB.21.26	They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
JOB.21.27	Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.
JOB.21.28	For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?
JOB.21.29	Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,
JOB.21.30	That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
JOB.21.31	Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?
JOB.21.32	Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.
JOB.21.33	The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.
JOB.21.34	How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
JOB.22.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
JOB.22.2	Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?
JOB.22.3	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
JOB.22.4	Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?
JOB.22.5	Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?
JOB.22.6	For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
JOB.22.7	Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
JOB.22.8	But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.
JOB.22.9	Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
JOB.22.10	Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;
JOB.22.11	Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.
JOB.22.12	Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
JOB.22.13	And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?
JOB.22.14	Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.
JOB.22.15	Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
JOB.22.16	Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:
JOB.22.17	Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?
JOB.22.18	Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.22.19	The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.
JOB.22.20	Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
JOB.22.21	Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.
JOB.22.22	Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.
JOB.22.23	If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
JOB.22.24	Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.
JOB.22.25	Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.
JOB.22.26	For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.
JOB.22.27	Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.
JOB.22.28	Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
JOB.22.29	When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.
JOB.22.30	He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
JOB.23.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.23.2	Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
JOB.23.3	Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!
JOB.23.4	I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
JOB.23.5	I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.
JOB.23.6	Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.
JOB.23.7	There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
JOB.23.8	Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:
JOB.23.9	On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:
JOB.23.10	But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
JOB.23.11	My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
JOB.23.12	Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
JOB.23.13	But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
JOB.23.14	For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.
JOB.23.15	Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.
JOB.23.16	For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
JOB.23.17	Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.
JOB.24.1	Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?
JOB.24.2	Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.
JOB.24.3	They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
JOB.24.4	They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
JOB.24.5	Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.
JOB.24.6	They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
JOB.24.7	They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.
JOB.24.8	They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
JOB.24.9	They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.
JOB.24.10	They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;
JOB.24.11	Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.
JOB.24.12	Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.
JOB.24.13	They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.
JOB.24.14	The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.
JOB.24.15	The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.
JOB.24.16	In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.
JOB.24.17	For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.
JOB.24.18	He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
JOB.24.19	Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.
JOB.24.20	The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
JOB.24.21	He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.
JOB.24.22	He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.
JOB.24.23	Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.
JOB.24.24	They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
JOB.24.25	And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?
JOB.25.1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
JOB.25.2	Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.
JOB.25.3	Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?
JOB.25.4	How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
JOB.25.5	Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.
JOB.25.6	How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm?
JOB.26.1	But Job answered and said,
JOB.26.2	How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
JOB.26.3	How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
JOB.26.4	To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
JOB.26.5	Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
JOB.26.6	Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
JOB.26.7	He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.
JOB.26.8	He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
JOB.26.9	He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.
JOB.26.10	He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
JOB.26.11	The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
JOB.26.12	He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
JOB.26.13	By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
JOB.26.14	Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
JOB.27.1	Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
JOB.27.2	As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;
JOB.27.3	All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
JOB.27.4	My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
JOB.27.5	God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
JOB.27.6	My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
JOB.27.7	Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
JOB.27.8	For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?
JOB.27.9	Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
JOB.27.10	Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?
JOB.27.11	I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
JOB.27.12	Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?
JOB.27.13	This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.
JOB.27.14	If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
JOB.27.15	Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.
JOB.27.16	Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;
JOB.27.17	He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
JOB.27.18	He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.
JOB.27.19	The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.
JOB.27.20	Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
JOB.27.21	The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
JOB.27.22	For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.
JOB.27.23	Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
JOB.28.1	Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.
JOB.28.2	Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.
JOB.28.3	He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.
JOB.28.4	The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.
JOB.28.5	As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.
JOB.28.6	The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.
JOB.28.7	There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:
JOB.28.8	The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
JOB.28.9	He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
JOB.28.10	He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
JOB.28.11	He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
JOB.28.12	But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.13	Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.
JOB.28.14	The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.
JOB.28.15	It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
JOB.28.16	It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
JOB.28.17	The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.
JOB.28.18	No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.
JOB.28.19	The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
JOB.28.20	Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.21	Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.
JOB.28.22	Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
JOB.28.23	God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
JOB.28.24	For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;
JOB.28.25	To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
JOB.28.26	When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:
JOB.28.27	Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
JOB.28.28	And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
JOB.29.1	Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
JOB.29.2	Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;
JOB.29.3	When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;
JOB.29.4	As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;
JOB.29.5	When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;
JOB.29.6	When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
JOB.29.7	When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!
JOB.29.8	The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.
JOB.29.9	The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.
JOB.29.10	The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
JOB.29.11	When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:
JOB.29.12	Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.
JOB.29.13	The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
JOB.29.14	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.
JOB.29.15	I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
JOB.29.16	I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.
JOB.29.17	And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
JOB.29.18	Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.
JOB.29.19	My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.
JOB.29.20	My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
JOB.29.21	Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.
JOB.29.22	After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
JOB.29.23	And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
JOB.29.24	If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
JOB.29.25	I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.
JOB.30.1	But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.
JOB.30.2	Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?
JOB.30.3	For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
JOB.30.4	Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.
JOB.30.5	They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)
JOB.30.6	To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.
JOB.30.7	Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.
JOB.30.8	They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.
JOB.30.9	And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
JOB.30.10	They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
JOB.30.11	Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
JOB.30.12	Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
JOB.30.13	They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
JOB.30.14	They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.
JOB.30.15	Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
JOB.30.16	And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
JOB.30.17	My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
JOB.30.18	By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
JOB.30.19	He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.
JOB.30.21	Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
JOB.30.22	Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.
JOB.30.23	For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.
JOB.30.24	Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
JOB.30.25	Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?
JOB.30.26	When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
JOB.30.27	My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.
JOB.30.28	I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.
JOB.30.29	I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
JOB.30.30	My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
JOB.30.31	My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
JOB.31.1	I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
JOB.31.2	For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
JOB.31.3	Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?
JOB.31.4	Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
JOB.31.5	If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
JOB.31.6	Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.
JOB.31.7	If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
JOB.31.8	Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
JOB.31.9	If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;
JOB.31.10	Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.
JOB.31.11	For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.
JOB.31.12	For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.
JOB.31.13	If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;
JOB.31.14	What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
JOB.31.15	Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
JOB.31.16	If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
JOB.31.17	Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
JOB.31.18	(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
JOB.31.19	If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
JOB.31.20	If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
JOB.31.21	If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
JOB.31.22	Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.
JOB.31.23	For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
JOB.31.24	If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
JOB.31.25	If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;
JOB.31.26	If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;
JOB.31.27	And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
JOB.31.28	This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.
JOB.31.29	If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:
JOB.31.30	Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
JOB.31.31	If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
JOB.31.32	The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.
JOB.31.33	If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:
JOB.31.34	Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?
JOB.31.35	Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.
JOB.31.36	Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.
JOB.31.37	I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
JOB.31.38	If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
JOB.31.39	If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
JOB.31.40	Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
JOB.32.1	So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
JOB.32.2	Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
JOB.32.3	Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
JOB.32.4	Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
JOB.32.5	When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
JOB.32.6	And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.
JOB.32.7	I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
JOB.32.8	But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
JOB.32.9	Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
JOB.32.10	Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
JOB.32.11	Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.
JOB.32.12	Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:
JOB.32.13	Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.
JOB.32.14	Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
JOB.32.15	They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
JOB.32.16	When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)
JOB.32.17	I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.
JOB.32.18	For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
JOB.32.19	Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.
JOB.32.20	I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.
JOB.32.21	Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
JOB.32.22	For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.
JOB.33.1	Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
JOB.33.2	Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
JOB.33.3	My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
JOB.33.4	The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
JOB.33.5	If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.
JOB.33.6	Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.
JOB.33.7	Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
JOB.33.8	Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,
JOB.33.9	I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.
JOB.33.10	Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
JOB.33.11	He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
JOB.33.12	Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
JOB.33.13	Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
JOB.33.14	For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
JOB.33.15	In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
JOB.33.16	Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
JOB.33.17	That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
JOB.33.18	He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
JOB.33.19	He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:
JOB.33.20	So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.
JOB.33.21	His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
JOB.33.22	Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
JOB.33.23	If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:
JOB.33.24	Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
JOB.33.25	His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:
JOB.33.26	He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.
JOB.33.27	He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;
JOB.33.28	He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
JOB.33.29	Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,
JOB.33.30	To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
JOB.33.31	Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
JOB.33.32	If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.
JOB.33.33	If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
JOB.34.1	Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
JOB.34.2	Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
JOB.34.3	For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
JOB.34.4	Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
JOB.34.5	For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
JOB.34.6	Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
JOB.34.7	What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?
JOB.34.8	Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
JOB.34.9	For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
JOB.34.10	Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
JOB.34.11	For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.
JOB.34.12	Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
JOB.34.13	Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
JOB.34.14	If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
JOB.34.15	All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
JOB.34.16	If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
JOB.34.17	Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
JOB.34.18	Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?
JOB.34.19	How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.
JOB.34.20	In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
JOB.34.21	For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
JOB.34.22	There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
JOB.34.23	For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
JOB.34.24	He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
JOB.34.25	Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
JOB.34.26	He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
JOB.34.27	Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
JOB.34.28	So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
JOB.34.29	When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
JOB.34.30	That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
JOB.34.31	Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
JOB.34.32	That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
JOB.34.33	Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
JOB.34.34	Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
JOB.34.35	Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
JOB.34.36	My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.
JOB.34.37	For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
JOB.35.1	Elihu spake moreover, and said,
JOB.35.2	Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?
JOB.35.3	For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?
JOB.35.4	I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
JOB.35.5	Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.
JOB.35.6	If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
JOB.35.7	If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?
JOB.35.8	Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.
JOB.35.9	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
JOB.35.10	But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;
JOB.35.11	Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
JOB.35.12	There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
JOB.35.13	Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
JOB.35.14	Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.
JOB.35.15	But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:
JOB.35.16	Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
JOB.36.1	Elihu also proceeded, and said,
JOB.36.2	Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.
JOB.36.3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
JOB.36.4	For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
JOB.36.5	Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.
JOB.36.6	He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
JOB.36.7	He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
JOB.36.8	And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;
JOB.36.9	Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
JOB.36.10	He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
JOB.36.11	If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
JOB.36.12	But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
JOB.36.13	But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
JOB.36.14	They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
JOB.36.15	He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
JOB.36.16	Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.
JOB.36.17	But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
JOB.36.18	Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
JOB.36.19	Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
JOB.36.20	Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
JOB.36.21	Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
JOB.36.22	Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
JOB.36.23	Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
JOB.36.24	Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
JOB.36.25	Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
JOB.36.26	Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
JOB.36.27	For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
JOB.36.28	Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.
JOB.36.29	Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?
JOB.36.30	Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
JOB.36.31	For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
JOB.36.32	With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
JOB.36.33	The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
JOB.37.1	At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.
JOB.37.2	Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
JOB.37.3	He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
JOB.37.4	After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
JOB.37.5	God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
JOB.37.6	For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.
JOB.37.7	He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
JOB.37.8	Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
JOB.37.9	Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
JOB.37.10	By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
JOB.37.11	Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:
JOB.37.12	And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.
JOB.37.13	He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
JOB.37.14	Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
JOB.37.15	Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
JOB.37.16	Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?
JOB.37.17	How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?
JOB.37.18	Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?
JOB.37.19	Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
JOB.37.20	Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.
JOB.37.21	And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
JOB.37.22	Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.
JOB.37.23	Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
JOB.37.24	Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
JOB.38.1	Then the 
JOB.38.2	Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
JOB.38.3	Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
JOB.38.4	Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.
JOB.38.5	Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
JOB.38.6	Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
JOB.38.7	When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
JOB.38.8	Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?
JOB.38.9	When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
JOB.38.10	And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,
JOB.38.11	And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
JOB.38.12	Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;
JOB.38.13	That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
JOB.38.14	It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.
JOB.38.15	And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.
JOB.38.16	Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
JOB.38.17	Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
JOB.38.18	Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.
JOB.38.19	Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
JOB.38.20	That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?
JOB.38.21	Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?
JOB.38.22	Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
JOB.38.23	Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
JOB.38.24	By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
JOB.38.25	Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
JOB.38.26	To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
JOB.38.27	To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
JOB.38.28	Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
JOB.38.29	Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
JOB.38.30	The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
JOB.38.31	Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
JOB.38.32	Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
JOB.38.33	Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
JOB.38.34	Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
JOB.38.35	Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?
JOB.38.36	Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?
JOB.38.37	Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
JOB.38.38	When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?
JOB.38.39	Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,
JOB.38.40	When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?
JOB.38.41	Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
JOB.39.1	Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
JOB.39.2	Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
JOB.39.3	They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.
JOB.39.4	Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.
JOB.39.5	Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
JOB.39.6	Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.
JOB.39.7	He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
JOB.39.8	The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.
JOB.39.9	Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
JOB.39.10	Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
JOB.39.11	Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
JOB.39.12	Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?
JOB.39.13	Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?
JOB.39.14	Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,
JOB.39.15	And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.
JOB.39.16	She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;
JOB.39.17	Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
JOB.39.18	What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.
JOB.39.19	Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
JOB.39.20	Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.
JOB.39.21	He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.
JOB.39.22	He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.
JOB.39.23	The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
JOB.39.24	He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
JOB.39.25	He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
JOB.39.26	Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?
JOB.39.27	Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?
JOB.39.28	She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
JOB.39.29	From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.
JOB.39.30	Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.
JOB.40.1	Moreover the 
JOB.40.2	Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.
JOB.40.3	Then Job answered the 
JOB.40.4	Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.
JOB.40.5	Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.
JOB.40.6	Then answered the 
JOB.40.7	Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
JOB.40.8	Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
JOB.40.9	Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
JOB.40.10	Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.
JOB.40.11	Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.
JOB.40.12	Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
JOB.40.13	Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.
JOB.40.14	Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.
JOB.40.15	Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.
JOB.40.16	Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.
JOB.40.17	He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
JOB.40.18	His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.
JOB.40.19	He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.
JOB.40.20	Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
JOB.40.21	He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
JOB.40.22	The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.
JOB.40.23	Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
JOB.40.24	He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
JOB.41.1	Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
JOB.41.2	Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
JOB.41.3	Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?
JOB.41.4	Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
JOB.41.5	Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
JOB.41.6	Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?
JOB.41.7	Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?
JOB.41.8	Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
JOB.41.9	Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
JOB.41.10	None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?
JOB.41.11	Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.
JOB.41.12	I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
JOB.41.13	Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?
JOB.41.14	Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.
JOB.41.15	His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
JOB.41.16	One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
JOB.41.17	They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
JOB.41.18	By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
JOB.41.19	Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
JOB.41.20	Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
JOB.41.21	His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
JOB.41.22	In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
JOB.41.23	The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
JOB.41.24	His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.
JOB.41.25	When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
JOB.41.26	The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
JOB.41.27	He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
JOB.41.29	Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
JOB.41.30	Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
JOB.41.31	He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
JOB.41.32	He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
JOB.41.33	Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
JOB.41.34	He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.
JOB.42.1	Then Job answered the 
JOB.42.2	I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.
JOB.42.3	Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
JOB.42.4	Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
JOB.42.5	I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.
JOB.42.6	Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
JOB.42.7	And it was so, that after the 
JOB.42.8	Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.
JOB.42.9	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the 
JOB.42.10	And the 
JOB.42.11	Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the 
JOB.42.12	So the 
JOB.42.13	He had also seven sons and three daughters.
JOB.42.14	And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren–happuch.
JOB.42.15	And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
JOB.42.16	After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
JOB.42.17	So Job died, being old and full of days.
PSA.1.1	Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
PSA.1.2	But his delight is in the law of the 
PSA.1.3	And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
PSA.1.4	The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
PSA.1.5	Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
PSA.1.6	For the 
PSA.2.1	Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
PSA.2.2	The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the 
PSA.2.3	Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
PSA.2.4	He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.
PSA.2.5	Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.
PSA.2.6	Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
PSA.2.7	I will declare the decree: the 
PSA.2.8	Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
PSA.2.9	Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
PSA.2.10	Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
PSA.2.11	Serve the 
PSA.2.12	Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
PSA.3.2	Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.
PSA.3.3	But thou, O 
PSA.3.4	I cried unto the 
PSA.3.5	I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the 
PSA.3.6	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.
PSA.3.7	Arise, O 
PSA.3.8	Salvation belongeth unto the 
PSA.4.1	Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
PSA.4.2	O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.
PSA.4.3	But know that the 
PSA.4.4	Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
PSA.4.5	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the 
PSA.4.6	There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? 
PSA.4.7	Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.
PSA.4.8	I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, 
PSA.5.1	Give ear to my words, O 
PSA.5.2	Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.
PSA.5.3	My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O 
PSA.5.4	For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.
PSA.5.5	The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
PSA.5.6	Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the 
PSA.5.7	But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
PSA.5.8	Lead me, O 
PSA.5.9	For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
PSA.5.10	Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
PSA.5.11	But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
PSA.5.12	For thou, 
PSA.6.1	O 
PSA.6.2	Have mercy upon me, O 
PSA.6.3	My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O 
PSA.6.4	Return, O 
PSA.6.5	For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
PSA.6.6	I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
PSA.6.7	Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
PSA.6.8	Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the 
PSA.6.9	The 
PSA.6.10	Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.
PSA.7.1	O 
PSA.7.2	Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
PSA.7.3	O 
PSA.7.4	If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
PSA.7.5	Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.
PSA.7.6	Arise, O 
PSA.7.7	So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
PSA.7.8	The 
PSA.7.9	Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
PSA.7.10	My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
PSA.7.11	God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.
PSA.7.12	If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
PSA.7.13	He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
PSA.7.14	Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
PSA.7.15	He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.
PSA.7.16	His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
PSA.7.17	I will praise the 
PSA.8.1	O 
PSA.8.2	Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
PSA.8.3	When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
PSA.8.4	What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
PSA.8.5	For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
PSA.8.6	Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:
PSA.8.7	All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
PSA.8.8	The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
PSA.8.9	O 
PSA.9.1	I will praise thee, O 
PSA.9.2	I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.
PSA.9.3	When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
PSA.9.4	For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
PSA.9.5	Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
PSA.9.6	O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
PSA.9.7	But the 
PSA.9.8	And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
PSA.9.9	The 
PSA.9.10	And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, 
PSA.9.11	Sing praises to the 
PSA.9.12	When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
PSA.9.13	Have mercy upon me, O 
PSA.9.14	That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
PSA.9.15	The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
PSA.9.16	The 
PSA.9.17	The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.
PSA.9.18	For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.
PSA.9.19	Arise, O 
PSA.9.20	Put them in fear, O 
PSA.10.1	Why standest thou afar off, O 
PSA.10.2	The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
PSA.10.3	For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the 
PSA.10.4	The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
PSA.10.5	His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
PSA.10.6	He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.
PSA.10.7	His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.
PSA.10.8	He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.
PSA.10.9	He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.
PSA.10.10	He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.
PSA.10.11	He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.
PSA.10.12	Arise, O 
PSA.10.13	Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.
PSA.10.14	Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.
PSA.10.15	Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.
PSA.10.16	The 
PSA.10.18	To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
PSA.11.1	In the 
PSA.11.2	For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
PSA.11.3	If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
PSA.11.4	The 
PSA.11.5	The 
PSA.11.6	Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.
PSA.11.7	For the righteous 
PSA.12.1	Help, 
PSA.12.2	They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.
PSA.12.3	The 
PSA.12.4	Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?
PSA.12.5	For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the 
PSA.12.6	The words of the 
PSA.12.7	Thou shalt keep them, O 
PSA.12.8	The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
PSA.13.1	How long wilt thou forget me, O 
PSA.13.2	How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
PSA.13.3	Consider and hear me, O 
PSA.13.4	Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
PSA.13.5	But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
PSA.13.6	I will sing unto the 
PSA.14.1	The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.
PSA.14.2	The 
PSA.14.3	They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
PSA.14.4	Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the 
PSA.14.5	There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.
PSA.14.6	Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the 
PSA.14.7	Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the 
PSA.15.2	He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.
PSA.15.3	He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.
PSA.15.4	In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the 
PSA.15.5	He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
PSA.16.1	Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
PSA.16.2	O my soul, thou hast said unto the 
PSA.16.3	But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.
PSA.16.4	Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.
PSA.16.5	The 
PSA.16.6	The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
PSA.16.7	I will bless the 
PSA.16.8	I have set the 
PSA.16.9	Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
PSA.16.10	For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
PSA.16.11	Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
PSA.17.1	Hear the right, O 
PSA.17.2	Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.
PSA.17.3	Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
PSA.17.4	Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.
PSA.17.5	Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
PSA.17.6	I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.
PSA.17.7	Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.
PSA.17.8	Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
PSA.17.9	From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.
PSA.17.10	They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.
PSA.17.11	They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;
PSA.17.12	Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
PSA.17.13	Arise, O 
PSA.17.14	From men which are thy hand, O 
PSA.17.15	As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
PSA.18.1	I will love thee, O 
PSA.18.2	The 
PSA.18.3	I will call upon the 
PSA.18.4	The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
PSA.18.5	The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.
PSA.18.6	In my distress I called upon the 
PSA.18.7	Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
PSA.18.8	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
PSA.18.9	He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.
PSA.18.10	And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
PSA.18.11	He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
PSA.18.12	At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.
PSA.18.13	The 
PSA.18.14	Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
PSA.18.15	Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O 
PSA.18.16	He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
PSA.18.17	He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.
PSA.18.18	They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the 
PSA.18.19	He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
PSA.18.20	The 
PSA.18.21	For I have kept the ways of the 
PSA.18.22	For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
PSA.18.23	I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
PSA.18.24	Therefore hath the 
PSA.18.25	With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
PSA.18.26	With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.
PSA.18.27	For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.
PSA.18.28	For thou wilt light my candle: the 
PSA.18.29	For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
PSA.18.30	As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the 
PSA.18.31	For who is God save the 
PSA.18.32	It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.
PSA.18.33	He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.
PSA.18.34	He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
PSA.18.35	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
PSA.18.36	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
PSA.18.37	I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
PSA.18.38	I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.
PSA.18.39	For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
PSA.18.40	Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.
PSA.18.41	They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the 
PSA.18.42	Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
PSA.18.43	Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.
PSA.18.44	As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
PSA.18.45	The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.
PSA.18.46	The 
PSA.18.47	It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
PSA.18.48	He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
PSA.18.49	Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O 
PSA.18.50	Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
PSA.19.1	The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.
PSA.19.2	Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
PSA.19.3	There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
PSA.19.4	Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
PSA.19.5	Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.
PSA.19.6	His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
PSA.19.7	The law of the 
PSA.19.8	The statutes of the 
PSA.19.9	The fear of the 
PSA.19.10	More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
PSA.19.11	Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.
PSA.19.12	Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.
PSA.19.13	Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
PSA.19.14	Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O 
PSA.20.1	The 
PSA.20.2	Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;
PSA.20.3	Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.
PSA.20.4	Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.
PSA.20.5	We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the 
PSA.20.6	Now know I that the 
PSA.20.7	Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the 
PSA.20.8	They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
PSA.20.9	Save, 
PSA.21.1	The king shall joy in thy strength, O 
PSA.21.2	Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.
PSA.21.3	For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.
PSA.21.4	He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.
PSA.21.5	His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.
PSA.21.6	For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
PSA.21.7	For the king trusteth in the 
PSA.21.8	Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
PSA.21.9	Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the 
PSA.21.10	Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
PSA.21.11	For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.
PSA.21.12	Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.
PSA.21.13	Be thou exalted, 
PSA.22.1	My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?
PSA.22.2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.
PSA.22.3	But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
PSA.22.4	Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
PSA.22.5	They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
PSA.22.6	But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.
PSA.22.7	All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
PSA.22.8	He trusted on the 
PSA.22.9	But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.
PSA.22.10	I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly.
PSA.22.11	Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.
PSA.22.12	Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
PSA.22.13	They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.
PSA.22.14	I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
PSA.22.15	My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
PSA.22.16	For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
PSA.22.17	I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.
PSA.22.18	They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
PSA.22.19	But be not thou far from me, O 
PSA.22.20	Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.
PSA.22.21	Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.
PSA.22.22	I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
PSA.22.23	Ye that fear the 
PSA.22.24	For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.
PSA.22.25	My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
PSA.22.26	The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the 
PSA.22.27	All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the 
PSA.22.28	For the kingdom is the 
PSA.22.29	All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.
PSA.22.30	A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.
PSA.22.31	They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.
PSA.23.1	The 
PSA.23.2	He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
PSA.23.3	He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
PSA.23.4	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
PSA.23.5	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
PSA.23.6	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the 
PSA.24.1	The earth is the 
PSA.24.2	For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.
PSA.24.3	Who shall ascend into the hill of the 
PSA.24.4	He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
PSA.24.5	He shall receive the blessing from the 
PSA.24.6	This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.
PSA.24.7	Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
PSA.24.8	Who is this King of glory? The 
PSA.24.9	Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
PSA.24.10	Who is this King of glory? The 
PSA.25.1	Unto thee, O 
PSA.25.2	O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.
PSA.25.3	Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.
PSA.25.4	Shew me thy ways, O 
PSA.25.5	Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.
PSA.25.6	Remember, O 
PSA.25.7	Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O 
PSA.25.8	Good and upright is the 
PSA.25.9	The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.
PSA.25.10	All the paths of the 
PSA.25.11	For thy name's sake, O 
PSA.25.12	What man is he that feareth the 
PSA.25.13	His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.
PSA.25.14	The secret of the 
PSA.25.15	Mine eyes are ever toward the 
PSA.25.16	Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.
PSA.25.17	The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.
PSA.25.18	Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.
PSA.25.19	Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.
PSA.25.20	O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.
PSA.25.21	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
PSA.25.22	Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
PSA.26.1	Judge me, O 
PSA.26.2	Examine me, O 
PSA.26.3	For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.
PSA.26.4	I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.
PSA.26.5	I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.
PSA.26.6	I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O 
PSA.26.7	That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.
PSA.26.9	Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:
PSA.26.10	In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.
PSA.26.11	But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.
PSA.26.12	My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the 
PSA.27.1	The 
PSA.27.2	When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
PSA.27.3	Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.
PSA.27.4	One thing have I desired of the 
PSA.27.5	For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.
PSA.27.6	And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the 
PSA.27.7	Hear, O 
PSA.27.8	When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, 
PSA.27.9	Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
PSA.27.10	When my father and my mother forsake me, then the 
PSA.27.11	Teach me thy way, O 
PSA.27.12	Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.
PSA.27.13	I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the 
PSA.27.14	Wait on the 
PSA.28.1	Unto thee will I cry, O 
PSA.28.2	Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
PSA.28.3	Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.
PSA.28.4	Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.
PSA.28.5	Because they regard not the works of the 
PSA.28.6	Blessed be the 
PSA.28.7	The 
PSA.28.8	The 
PSA.28.9	Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.
PSA.29.1	Give unto the 
PSA.29.2	Give unto the 
PSA.29.3	The voice of the 
PSA.29.4	The voice of the 
PSA.29.5	The voice of the 
PSA.29.6	He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.
PSA.29.7	The voice of the 
PSA.29.8	The voice of the 
PSA.29.9	The voice of the 
PSA.29.10	The 
PSA.29.11	The 
PSA.30.1	I will extol thee, O 
PSA.30.2	O 
PSA.30.3	O 
PSA.30.4	Sing unto the 
PSA.30.5	For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
PSA.30.6	And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
PSA.30.8	I cried to thee, O 
PSA.30.9	What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
PSA.30.10	Hear, O 
PSA.30.11	Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
PSA.30.12	To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O 
PSA.31.1	In thee, O 
PSA.31.2	Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.
PSA.31.3	For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.
PSA.31.4	Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.
PSA.31.5	Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O 
PSA.31.6	I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the 
PSA.31.7	I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;
PSA.31.8	And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.
PSA.31.9	Have mercy upon me, O 
PSA.31.10	For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.
PSA.31.11	I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.
PSA.31.12	I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.
PSA.31.13	For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.
PSA.31.14	But I trusted in thee, O 
PSA.31.15	My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
PSA.31.16	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.
PSA.31.17	Let me not be ashamed, O 
PSA.31.18	Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
PSA.31.19	Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!
PSA.31.20	Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
PSA.31.21	Blessed be the 
PSA.31.22	For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.
PSA.31.23	O love the 
PSA.31.24	Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the 
PSA.32.1	Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
PSA.32.2	Blessed is the man unto whom the 
PSA.32.3	When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.
PSA.32.4	For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
PSA.32.5	I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the 
PSA.32.6	For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
PSA.32.7	Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.
PSA.32.8	I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.
PSA.32.9	Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.
PSA.32.10	Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the 
PSA.32.11	Be glad in the 
PSA.33.1	Rejoice in the 
PSA.33.2	Praise the 
PSA.33.3	Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
PSA.33.4	For the word of the 
PSA.33.5	He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the 
PSA.33.6	By the word of the 
PSA.33.7	He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.
PSA.33.8	Let all the earth fear the 
PSA.33.9	For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.
PSA.33.10	The 
PSA.33.11	The counsel of the 
PSA.33.12	Blessed is the nation whose God is the 
PSA.33.13	The 
PSA.33.14	From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
PSA.33.15	He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.
PSA.33.16	There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
PSA.33.17	An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.
PSA.33.18	Behold, the eye of the 
PSA.33.19	To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
PSA.33.20	Our soul waiteth for the 
PSA.33.21	For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.
PSA.33.22	Let thy mercy, O 
PSA.34.1	I will bless the 
PSA.34.2	My soul shall make her boast in the 
PSA.34.3	O magnify the 
PSA.34.4	I sought the 
PSA.34.5	They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.
PSA.34.6	This poor man cried, and the 
PSA.34.7	The angel of the 
PSA.34.8	O taste and see that the 
PSA.34.9	O fear the 
PSA.34.10	The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the 
PSA.34.11	Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the 
PSA.34.12	What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?
PSA.34.13	Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
PSA.34.14	Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
PSA.34.15	The eyes of the 
PSA.34.16	The face of the 
PSA.34.17	The righteous cry, and the 
PSA.34.18	The 
PSA.34.19	Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the 
PSA.34.20	He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.
PSA.34.21	Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.
PSA.34.22	The 
PSA.35.1	Plead my cause, O 
PSA.35.2	Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.
PSA.35.3	Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
PSA.35.4	Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.
PSA.35.5	Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the 
PSA.35.6	Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the 
PSA.35.7	For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul.
PSA.35.8	Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.
PSA.35.9	And my soul shall be joyful in the 
PSA.35.10	All my bones shall say, 
PSA.35.11	False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
PSA.35.12	They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.
PSA.35.13	But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.
PSA.35.14	I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.
PSA.35.15	But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:
PSA.35.16	With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
PSA.35.17	Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.
PSA.35.18	I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.
PSA.35.19	Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
PSA.35.20	For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.
PSA.35.21	Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.
PSA.35.22	This thou hast seen, O 
PSA.35.23	Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.
PSA.35.24	Judge me, O 
PSA.35.25	Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
PSA.35.26	Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.
PSA.35.27	Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the 
PSA.35.28	And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.
PSA.36.1	The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.
PSA.36.2	For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.
PSA.36.3	The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.
PSA.36.4	He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.
PSA.36.5	Thy mercy, O 
PSA.36.6	Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O 
PSA.36.7	How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
PSA.36.8	They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
PSA.36.9	For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.
PSA.36.10	O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
PSA.36.11	Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.
PSA.36.12	There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.
PSA.37.1	Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.
PSA.37.2	For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.
PSA.37.3	Trust in the 
PSA.37.4	Delight thyself also in the 
PSA.37.5	Commit thy way unto the 
PSA.37.6	And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.
PSA.37.7	Rest in the 
PSA.37.8	Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.
PSA.37.9	For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the 
PSA.37.10	For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.
PSA.37.11	But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
PSA.37.12	The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
PSA.37.13	The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.
PSA.37.14	The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.
PSA.37.15	Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
PSA.37.16	A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.
PSA.37.17	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the 
PSA.37.18	The 
PSA.37.19	They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
PSA.37.20	But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the 
PSA.37.21	The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.
PSA.37.22	For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.
PSA.37.23	The steps of a good man are ordered by the 
PSA.37.24	Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the 
PSA.37.25	I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
PSA.37.26	He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.
PSA.37.27	Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.
PSA.37.28	For the 
PSA.37.29	The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.
PSA.37.30	The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.
PSA.37.31	The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.
PSA.37.32	The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
PSA.37.33	The 
PSA.37.34	Wait on the 
PSA.37.35	I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.
PSA.37.36	Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
PSA.37.37	Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.
PSA.37.38	But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.
PSA.37.39	But the salvation of the righteous is of the 
PSA.37.40	And the 
PSA.38.1	O 
PSA.38.2	For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
PSA.38.3	There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.
PSA.38.4	For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
PSA.38.5	My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
PSA.38.6	I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
PSA.38.7	For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.
PSA.38.8	I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
PSA.38.9	Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.
PSA.38.10	My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
PSA.38.11	My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.
PSA.38.12	They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.
PSA.38.13	But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
PSA.38.14	Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
PSA.38.15	For in thee, O 
PSA.38.16	For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
PSA.38.17	For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
PSA.38.18	For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
PSA.38.19	But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
PSA.38.20	They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.
PSA.38.21	Forsake me not, O 
PSA.38.22	Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
PSA.39.1	I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.
PSA.39.2	I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.
PSA.39.3	My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,
PSA.39.5	Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.
PSA.39.6	Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
PSA.39.7	And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.
PSA.39.8	Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.
PSA.39.9	I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.
PSA.39.10	Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.
PSA.39.11	When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.
PSA.39.12	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.39.13	O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
PSA.40.1	I waited patiently for the 
PSA.40.2	He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
PSA.40.3	And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the 
PSA.40.4	Blessed is that man that maketh the 
PSA.40.5	Many, O 
PSA.40.6	Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
PSA.40.7	Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,
PSA.40.8	I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.
PSA.40.9	I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O 
PSA.40.10	I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.
PSA.40.11	Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O 
PSA.40.12	For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.
PSA.40.13	Be pleased, O 
PSA.40.14	Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
PSA.40.15	Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.
PSA.40.16	Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The 
PSA.40.17	But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
PSA.41.1	Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the 
PSA.41.2	The 
PSA.41.3	The 
PSA.41.4	I said, 
PSA.41.5	Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?
PSA.41.6	And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.
PSA.41.7	All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.
PSA.41.8	An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.
PSA.41.9	Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
PSA.41.10	But thou, O 
PSA.41.11	By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
PSA.41.12	And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.
PSA.41.13	Blessed be the 
PSA.42.1	As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.
PSA.42.2	My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?
PSA.42.3	My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?
PSA.42.4	When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.
PSA.42.5	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.
PSA.42.6	O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.
PSA.42.7	Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
PSA.42.8	Yet the 
PSA.42.9	I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
PSA.42.10	As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?
PSA.42.11	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.
PSA.43.1	Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
PSA.43.2	For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
PSA.43.3	O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.
PSA.43.4	Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.
PSA.43.5	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.
PSA.44.1	We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.
PSA.44.2	How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
PSA.44.3	For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.
PSA.44.4	Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.
PSA.44.5	Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
PSA.44.6	For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
PSA.44.7	But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.
PSA.44.8	In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.
PSA.44.9	But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.
PSA.44.10	Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.
PSA.44.11	Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.
PSA.44.12	Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.
PSA.44.13	Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
PSA.44.14	Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.
PSA.44.15	My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,
PSA.44.16	For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.
PSA.44.17	All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
PSA.44.18	Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;
PSA.44.19	Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.
PSA.44.20	If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;
PSA.44.21	Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
PSA.44.22	Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
PSA.44.23	Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.
PSA.44.24	Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
PSA.44.25	For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.
PSA.44.26	Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.
PSA.45.1	My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
PSA.45.2	Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
PSA.45.3	Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.
PSA.45.4	And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
PSA.45.5	Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.
PSA.45.6	Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
PSA.45.7	Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
PSA.45.8	All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.
PSA.45.9	Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
PSA.45.10	Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
PSA.45.11	So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.
PSA.45.12	And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favour.
PSA.45.13	The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
PSA.45.14	She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
PSA.45.15	With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.
PSA.45.16	Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.
PSA.45.17	I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
PSA.46.1	God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
PSA.46.2	Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
PSA.46.3	Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.
PSA.46.4	There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.
PSA.46.5	God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.
PSA.46.6	The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
PSA.46.7	The 
PSA.46.8	Come, behold the works of the 
PSA.46.9	He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.
PSA.46.10	Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
PSA.46.11	The 
PSA.47.1	O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
PSA.47.2	For the 
PSA.47.3	He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.
PSA.47.4	He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
PSA.47.5	God is gone up with a shout, the 
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
PSA.47.7	For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
PSA.47.8	God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.
PSA.47.9	The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.
PSA.48.1	Great is the 
PSA.48.2	Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.
PSA.48.3	God is known in her palaces for a refuge.
PSA.48.4	For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.
PSA.48.5	They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.
PSA.48.6	Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.
PSA.48.7	Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
PSA.48.8	As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the 
PSA.48.9	We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.
PSA.48.10	According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.
PSA.48.11	Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.
PSA.48.12	Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.
PSA.48.13	Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.
PSA.48.14	For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.
PSA.49.1	Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:
PSA.49.2	Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
PSA.49.3	My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
PSA.49.4	I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
PSA.49.5	Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
PSA.49.6	They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
PSA.49.7	None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:
PSA.49.8	(For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)
PSA.49.9	That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.
PSA.49.10	For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
PSA.49.11	Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.
PSA.49.12	Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.
PSA.49.13	This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
PSA.49.14	Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
PSA.49.15	But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.
PSA.49.16	Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
PSA.49.17	For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
PSA.49.18	Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.
PSA.49.19	He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.
PSA.49.20	Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.
PSA.50.1	The mighty God, even the 
PSA.50.2	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
PSA.50.3	Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
PSA.50.4	He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.
PSA.50.5	Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
PSA.50.6	And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah.
PSA.50.7	Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.
PSA.50.8	I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.
PSA.50.9	I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.
PSA.50.10	For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.
PSA.50.11	I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.
PSA.50.13	Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
PSA.50.14	Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:
PSA.50.15	And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
PSA.50.16	But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?
PSA.50.17	Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.
PSA.50.18	When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.
PSA.50.19	Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.
PSA.50.20	Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.
PSA.50.21	These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.
PSA.50.22	Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.
PSA.50.23	Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.
PSA.51.1	Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
PSA.51.2	Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
PSA.51.3	For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
PSA.51.4	Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.
PSA.51.5	Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
PSA.51.6	Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
PSA.51.7	Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
PSA.51.9	Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
PSA.51.10	Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
PSA.51.11	Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
PSA.51.12	Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.
PSA.51.13	Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
PSA.51.14	Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
PSA.51.15	O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.
PSA.51.16	For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.
PSA.51.17	The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
PSA.51.18	Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
PSA.52.1	Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God endureth continually.
PSA.52.2	Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
PSA.52.3	Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.
PSA.52.4	Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.
PSA.52.5	God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.
PSA.52.6	The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:
PSA.52.7	Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
PSA.52.8	But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
PSA.52.9	I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.
PSA.53.1	The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.
PSA.53.2	God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.
PSA.53.3	Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
PSA.53.4	Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.
PSA.53.5	There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.
PSA.53.6	Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
PSA.54.1	Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
PSA.54.2	Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
PSA.54.3	For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.
PSA.54.4	Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
PSA.54.5	He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.
PSA.54.6	I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O 
PSA.54.7	For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
PSA.55.1	Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.
PSA.55.2	Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
PSA.55.3	Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
PSA.55.4	My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
PSA.55.5	Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.
PSA.55.6	And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.
PSA.55.7	Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.
PSA.55.8	I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.
PSA.55.9	Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
PSA.55.10	Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.
PSA.55.11	Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.
PSA.55.12	For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:
PSA.55.13	But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.
PSA.55.14	We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.
PSA.55.15	Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
PSA.55.16	As for me, I will call upon God; and the 
PSA.55.17	Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.
PSA.55.18	He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.
PSA.55.19	God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
PSA.55.20	He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.
PSA.55.21	The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.
PSA.55.22	Cast thy burden upon the 
PSA.55.23	But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
PSA.56.1	Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.
PSA.56.2	Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High.
PSA.56.3	What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
PSA.56.4	In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
PSA.56.5	Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.
PSA.56.6	They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.
PSA.56.7	Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God.
PSA.56.8	Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?
PSA.56.9	When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me.
PSA.56.10	In God will I praise his word: in the 
PSA.56.11	In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
PSA.56.12	Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.
PSA.56.13	For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
PSA.57.1	Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.
PSA.57.2	I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.
PSA.57.3	He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.
PSA.57.4	My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
PSA.57.5	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.
PSA.57.6	They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.
PSA.57.7	My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.
PSA.57.8	Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
PSA.57.9	I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.
PSA.57.10	For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.
PSA.57.11	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.
PSA.58.1	Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
PSA.58.2	Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
PSA.58.3	The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.
PSA.58.4	Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;
PSA.58.5	Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
PSA.58.6	Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O 
PSA.58.7	Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
PSA.58.8	As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.
PSA.58.9	Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.
PSA.58.10	The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
PSA.58.11	So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
PSA.59.1	Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.
PSA.59.2	Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
PSA.59.3	For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O 
PSA.59.4	They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.
PSA.59.5	Thou therefore, O 
PSA.59.6	They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
PSA.59.7	Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?
PSA.59.8	But thou, O 
PSA.59.9	Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.
PSA.59.10	The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.
PSA.59.11	Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
PSA.59.12	For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.
PSA.59.13	Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.
PSA.59.14	And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
PSA.59.15	Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.
PSA.59.16	But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.
PSA.59.17	Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.
PSA.60.1	O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.
PSA.60.2	Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
PSA.60.3	Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.
PSA.60.4	Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
PSA.60.5	That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.
PSA.60.6	God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
PSA.60.7	Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
PSA.60.8	Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
PSA.60.10	Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?
PSA.60.11	Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
PSA.60.12	Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
PSA.61.1	Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
PSA.61.2	From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
PSA.61.3	For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.
PSA.61.4	I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.
PSA.61.5	For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.
PSA.61.6	Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.
PSA.61.7	He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.
PSA.61.8	So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
PSA.62.1	Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.
PSA.62.2	He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
PSA.62.3	How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.
PSA.62.4	They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.
PSA.62.5	My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.
PSA.62.6	He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.
PSA.62.7	In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
PSA.62.8	Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.
PSA.62.9	Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.
PSA.62.10	Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.
PSA.62.11	God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.
PSA.62.12	Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
PSA.63.1	O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;
PSA.63.2	To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
PSA.63.3	Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
PSA.63.4	Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.
PSA.63.5	My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:
PSA.63.6	When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.
PSA.63.7	Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
PSA.63.8	My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.
PSA.63.9	But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
PSA.63.10	They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.
PSA.63.11	But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
PSA.64.1	Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
PSA.64.2	Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:
PSA.64.3	Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:
PSA.64.4	That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
PSA.64.5	They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?
PSA.64.6	They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.
PSA.64.7	But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.
PSA.64.8	So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.
PSA.64.9	And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.
PSA.64.10	The righteous shall be glad in the 
PSA.65.1	Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.
PSA.65.2	O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
PSA.65.3	Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.
PSA.65.4	Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.
PSA.65.5	By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:
PSA.65.6	Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power:
PSA.65.7	Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.
PSA.65.8	They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
PSA.65.9	Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.
PSA.65.10	Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.
PSA.65.11	Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.
PSA.65.12	They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.
PSA.65.13	The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
PSA.66.1	Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:
PSA.66.2	Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.
PSA.66.3	Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
PSA.66.4	All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah.
PSA.66.5	Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
PSA.66.6	He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
PSA.66.7	He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
PSA.66.8	O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:
PSA.66.9	Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.
PSA.66.10	For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
PSA.66.11	Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.
PSA.66.12	Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
PSA.66.13	I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,
PSA.66.14	Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.
PSA.66.15	I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.
PSA.66.16	Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
PSA.66.17	I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
PSA.66.18	If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:
PSA.66.19	But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
PSA.66.20	Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
PSA.67.1	God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah.
PSA.67.2	That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.
PSA.67.3	Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
PSA.67.4	O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.
PSA.67.5	Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
PSA.67.6	Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.
PSA.67.7	God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
PSA.68.1	Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.
PSA.68.2	As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
PSA.68.3	But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.
PSA.68.4	Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name 
PSA.68.5	A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.
PSA.68.6	God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.
PSA.68.7	O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:
PSA.68.8	The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
PSA.68.9	Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.
PSA.68.10	Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.
PSA.68.11	The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.
PSA.68.12	Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.
PSA.68.13	Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.
PSA.68.14	When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Zalmon.
PSA.68.15	The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.
PSA.68.16	Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the 
PSA.68.17	The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.
PSA.68.18	Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the 
PSA.68.19	Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah.
PSA.68.20	He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto 
PSA.68.21	But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.
PSA.68.22	The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:
PSA.68.23	That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.
PSA.68.24	They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.
PSA.68.25	The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.
PSA.68.26	Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.
PSA.68.27	There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.
PSA.68.28	Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.
PSA.68.29	Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.
PSA.68.30	Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war.
PSA.68.31	Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.
PSA.68.32	Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:
PSA.68.33	To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.
PSA.68.34	Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.
PSA.68.35	O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.
PSA.69.1	Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.
PSA.69.2	I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
PSA.69.3	I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
PSA.69.4	They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.
PSA.69.5	O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.
PSA.69.6	Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord 
PSA.69.7	Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
PSA.69.8	I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.
PSA.69.9	For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
PSA.69.10	When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.
PSA.69.11	I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
PSA.69.12	They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.
PSA.69.13	But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O 
PSA.69.14	Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
PSA.69.15	Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
PSA.69.16	Hear me, O 
PSA.69.17	And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.
PSA.69.18	Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.
PSA.69.19	Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.
PSA.69.20	Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.
PSA.69.21	They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
PSA.69.22	Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.
PSA.69.23	Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.
PSA.69.24	Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
PSA.69.25	Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.
PSA.69.26	For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
PSA.69.27	Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.
PSA.69.28	Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.
PSA.69.29	But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
PSA.69.30	I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
PSA.69.31	This also shall please the 
PSA.69.32	The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.
PSA.69.33	For the 
PSA.69.34	Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.
PSA.69.35	For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.
PSA.69.36	The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
PSA.70.1	Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O 
PSA.70.2	Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
PSA.70.3	Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
PSA.70.4	Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
PSA.70.5	But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O 
PSA.71.1	In thee, O 
PSA.71.2	Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
PSA.71.3	Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.
PSA.71.4	Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
PSA.71.5	For thou art my hope, O Lord 
PSA.71.6	By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.
PSA.71.7	I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.
PSA.71.8	Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.
PSA.71.9	Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.
PSA.71.10	For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,
PSA.71.11	Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.
PSA.71.12	O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.
PSA.71.13	Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.
PSA.71.14	But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.
PSA.71.15	My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.
PSA.71.16	I will go in the strength of the Lord 
PSA.71.17	O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
PSA.71.18	Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.
PSA.71.19	Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!
PSA.71.20	Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
PSA.71.21	Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
PSA.71.22	I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.
PSA.71.23	My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
PSA.71.24	My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.
PSA.72.1	Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.
PSA.72.2	He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.
PSA.72.3	The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.
PSA.72.4	He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
PSA.72.5	They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.
PSA.72.6	He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.
PSA.72.7	In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.
PSA.72.8	He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
PSA.72.9	They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
PSA.72.10	The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
PSA.72.11	Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.
PSA.72.12	For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.
PSA.72.13	He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.
PSA.72.14	He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.
PSA.72.15	And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.
PSA.72.16	There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
PSA.72.17	His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.
PSA.72.18	Blessed be the 
PSA.72.19	And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.
PSA.72.20	The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
PSA.73.1	Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.
PSA.73.3	For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
PSA.73.4	For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.
PSA.73.5	They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.
PSA.73.6	Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.
PSA.73.7	Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.
PSA.73.8	They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.
PSA.73.9	They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.
PSA.73.10	Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.
PSA.73.11	And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?
PSA.73.12	Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.
PSA.73.13	Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.
PSA.73.14	For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.
PSA.73.15	If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.
PSA.73.16	When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
PSA.73.17	Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.
PSA.73.18	Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.
PSA.73.19	How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.
PSA.73.20	As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.
PSA.73.21	Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
PSA.73.22	So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.
PSA.73.23	Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.
PSA.73.24	Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.
PSA.73.25	Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.
PSA.73.26	My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
PSA.73.27	For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
PSA.73.28	But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord 
PSA.74.1	O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
PSA.74.2	Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
PSA.74.3	Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
PSA.74.4	Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.
PSA.74.5	A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.
PSA.74.6	But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.
PSA.74.7	They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.
PSA.74.8	They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
PSA.74.9	We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
PSA.74.10	O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
PSA.74.11	Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.
PSA.74.12	For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
PSA.74.13	Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.
PSA.74.14	Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
PSA.74.15	Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.
PSA.74.16	The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
PSA.74.17	Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O 
PSA.74.19	O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
PSA.74.20	Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
PSA.74.21	O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.
PSA.74.22	Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.
PSA.74.23	Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
PSA.75.1	Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.
PSA.75.2	When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
PSA.75.3	The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.
PSA.75.4	I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
PSA.75.5	Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.
PSA.75.6	For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
PSA.75.7	But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
PSA.75.8	For in the hand of the 
PSA.75.9	But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
PSA.75.10	All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
PSA.76.1	In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.
PSA.76.2	In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.
PSA.76.3	There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.
PSA.76.4	Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
PSA.76.5	The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.
PSA.76.6	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
PSA.76.7	Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
PSA.76.8	Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,
PSA.76.9	When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
PSA.76.10	Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
PSA.76.11	Vow, and pay unto the 
PSA.76.12	He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
PSA.77.1	I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.
PSA.77.2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
PSA.77.3	I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
PSA.77.4	Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
PSA.77.5	I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
PSA.77.6	I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
PSA.77.7	Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
PSA.77.8	Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?
PSA.77.9	Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
PSA.77.10	And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.
PSA.77.11	I will remember the works of the 
PSA.77.12	I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
PSA.77.13	Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?
PSA.77.14	Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
PSA.77.15	Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
PSA.77.16	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.
PSA.77.18	The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
PSA.77.19	Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
PSA.77.20	Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
PSA.78.1	Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
PSA.78.2	I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
PSA.78.3	Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
PSA.78.4	We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the 
PSA.78.5	For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
PSA.78.6	That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:
PSA.78.7	That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
PSA.78.8	And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
PSA.78.9	The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
PSA.78.10	They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
PSA.78.11	And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
PSA.78.12	Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
PSA.78.13	He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
PSA.78.14	In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
PSA.78.15	He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
PSA.78.16	He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
PSA.78.17	And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
PSA.78.18	And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
PSA.78.19	Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
PSA.78.20	Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
PSA.78.21	Therefore the 
PSA.78.22	Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
PSA.78.23	Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
PSA.78.24	And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
PSA.78.25	Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
PSA.78.26	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
PSA.78.27	He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
PSA.78.28	And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
PSA.78.29	So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
PSA.78.30	They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,
PSA.78.31	The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
PSA.78.32	For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
PSA.78.33	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
PSA.78.34	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
PSA.78.35	And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
PSA.78.36	Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
PSA.78.37	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
PSA.78.38	But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
PSA.78.39	For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
PSA.78.40	How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
PSA.78.41	Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
PSA.78.43	How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:
PSA.78.44	And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
PSA.78.45	He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
PSA.78.46	He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
PSA.78.47	He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
PSA.78.48	He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
PSA.78.49	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
PSA.78.50	He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
PSA.78.51	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
PSA.78.52	But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
PSA.78.53	And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
PSA.78.54	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
PSA.78.55	He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
PSA.78.56	Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
PSA.78.57	But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
PSA.78.58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
PSA.78.59	When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
PSA.78.60	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
PSA.78.61	And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
PSA.78.62	He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
PSA.78.63	The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
PSA.78.64	Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
PSA.78.66	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
PSA.78.67	Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
PSA.78.68	But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
PSA.78.69	And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
PSA.78.70	He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
PSA.78.71	From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
PSA.78.72	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
PSA.79.1	O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
PSA.79.2	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
PSA.79.3	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.
PSA.79.4	We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
PSA.79.5	How long, 
PSA.79.6	Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
PSA.79.7	For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
PSA.79.8	O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
PSA.79.9	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
PSA.79.10	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed.
PSA.79.11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
PSA.79.12	And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
PSA.79.13	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
PSA.80.1	Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.
PSA.80.2	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.
PSA.80.3	Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
PSA.80.4	O 
PSA.80.5	Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
PSA.80.6	Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
PSA.80.7	Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
PSA.80.8	Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
PSA.80.9	Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
PSA.80.10	The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.
PSA.80.11	She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.
PSA.80.12	Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
PSA.80.13	The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
PSA.80.14	Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
PSA.80.15	And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
PSA.80.16	It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
PSA.80.17	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
PSA.80.18	So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
PSA.80.19	Turn us again, O 
PSA.81.1	Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.2	Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
PSA.81.3	Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
PSA.81.4	For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.
PSA.81.6	I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.
PSA.81.7	Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
PSA.81.8	Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;
PSA.81.9	There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
PSA.81.10	I am the 
PSA.81.11	But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.
PSA.81.12	So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.
PSA.81.13	Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!
PSA.81.14	I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
PSA.81.15	The haters of the 
PSA.81.16	He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
PSA.82.1	God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
PSA.82.2	How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
PSA.82.3	Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
PSA.82.4	Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
PSA.82.5	They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
PSA.82.6	I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
PSA.82.7	But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
PSA.82.8	Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
PSA.83.1	Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
PSA.83.2	For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
PSA.83.3	They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
PSA.83.4	They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
PSA.83.5	For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:
PSA.83.6	The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarites;
PSA.83.7	Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
PSA.83.8	Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.
PSA.83.9	Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kishon:
PSA.83.10	Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.
PSA.83.11	Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
PSA.83.12	Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.
PSA.83.13	O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.
PSA.83.14	As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;
PSA.83.15	So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.
PSA.83.16	Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O 
PSA.83.17	Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
PSA.83.18	That men may know that thou, whose name alone is 
PSA.84.1	How amiable are thy tabernacles, O 
PSA.84.2	My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the 
PSA.84.3	Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O 
PSA.84.4	Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.
PSA.84.5	Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.
PSA.84.6	Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.
PSA.84.7	They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.
PSA.84.8	O 
PSA.84.9	Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
PSA.84.10	For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
PSA.84.11	For the 
PSA.84.12	O 
PSA.85.2	Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.
PSA.85.3	Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.
PSA.85.4	Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.
PSA.85.5	Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
PSA.85.6	Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
PSA.85.7	Shew us thy mercy, O 
PSA.85.8	I will hear what God the 
PSA.85.9	Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.
PSA.85.10	Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
PSA.85.11	Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
PSA.85.12	Yea, the 
PSA.85.13	Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.
PSA.86.1	Bow down thine ear, O 
PSA.86.2	Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
PSA.86.3	Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
PSA.86.4	Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
PSA.86.5	For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
PSA.86.6	Give ear, O 
PSA.86.7	In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.
PSA.86.8	Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.
PSA.86.9	All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
PSA.86.10	For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
PSA.86.11	Teach me thy way, O 
PSA.86.12	I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
PSA.86.13	For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
PSA.86.14	O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.
PSA.86.15	But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
PSA.86.16	O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
PSA.86.17	Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, 
PSA.87.1	His foundation is in the holy mountains.
PSA.87.2	The 
PSA.87.3	Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.
PSA.87.4	I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.
PSA.87.5	And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.
PSA.87.6	The 
PSA.87.7	As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.
PSA.88.1	O 
PSA.88.2	Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
PSA.88.3	For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
PSA.88.4	I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength:
PSA.88.5	Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
PSA.88.6	Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
PSA.88.7	Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.
PSA.88.8	Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
PSA.88.9	Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: 
PSA.88.10	Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah.
PSA.88.11	Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?
PSA.88.12	Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
PSA.88.13	But unto thee have I cried, O 
PSA.88.15	I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
PSA.88.16	Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
PSA.88.17	They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.
PSA.88.18	Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.
PSA.89.1	I will sing of the mercies of the 
PSA.89.2	For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.
PSA.89.3	I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,
PSA.89.4	Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.
PSA.89.5	And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O 
PSA.89.6	For who in the heaven can be compared unto the 
PSA.89.7	God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.
PSA.89.8	O 
PSA.89.9	Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
PSA.89.10	Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
PSA.89.11	The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
PSA.89.12	The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
PSA.89.13	Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
PSA.89.14	Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
PSA.89.15	Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O 
PSA.89.16	In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
PSA.89.17	For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
PSA.89.18	For the 
PSA.89.19	Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
PSA.89.20	I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:
PSA.89.21	With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.
PSA.89.22	The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
PSA.89.23	And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.
PSA.89.24	But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
PSA.89.25	I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
PSA.89.26	He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.
PSA.89.27	Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.
PSA.89.28	My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
PSA.89.29	His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.
PSA.89.30	If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
PSA.89.31	If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
PSA.89.32	Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.
PSA.89.33	Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
PSA.89.34	My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
PSA.89.35	Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
PSA.89.36	His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.
PSA.89.37	It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.
PSA.89.38	But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
PSA.89.39	Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
PSA.89.40	Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.
PSA.89.41	All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.
PSA.89.42	Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
PSA.89.43	Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.
PSA.89.44	Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.
PSA.89.45	The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.
PSA.89.46	How long, 
PSA.89.47	Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?
PSA.89.48	What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.
PSA.89.49	Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?
PSA.89.50	Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;
PSA.89.51	Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O 
PSA.89.52	Blessed be the 
PSA.90.1	Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
PSA.90.2	Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
PSA.90.3	Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.
PSA.90.4	For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.
PSA.90.5	Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
PSA.90.6	In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
PSA.90.7	For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.
PSA.90.8	Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
PSA.90.9	For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.
PSA.90.10	The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
PSA.90.11	Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.
PSA.90.12	So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
PSA.90.13	Return, O 
PSA.90.14	O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
PSA.90.15	Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.
PSA.90.16	Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.
PSA.90.17	And let the beauty of the 
PSA.91.1	He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
PSA.91.2	I will say of the 
PSA.91.3	Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.
PSA.91.4	He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
PSA.91.5	Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
PSA.91.6	Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
PSA.91.7	A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
PSA.91.8	Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
PSA.91.9	Because thou hast made the 
PSA.91.10	There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
PSA.91.11	For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
PSA.91.12	They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
PSA.91.13	Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
PSA.91.14	Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
PSA.91.15	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
PSA.91.16	With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
PSA.92.1	It is a good thing to give thanks unto the 
PSA.92.2	To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
PSA.92.3	Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.
PSA.92.4	For thou, 
PSA.92.5	O 
PSA.92.6	A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
PSA.92.7	When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:
PSA.92.8	But thou, 
PSA.92.9	For, lo, thine enemies, O 
PSA.92.10	But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
PSA.92.11	Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.
PSA.92.12	The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
PSA.92.13	Those that be planted in the house of the 
PSA.92.14	They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;
PSA.92.15	To shew that the 
PSA.93.1	The 
PSA.93.2	Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.
PSA.93.3	The floods have lifted up, O 
PSA.93.4	The 
PSA.93.5	Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O 
PSA.94.1	O 
PSA.94.2	Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.
PSA.94.4	How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
PSA.94.5	They break in pieces thy people, O 
PSA.94.6	They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.
PSA.94.7	Yet they say, The 
PSA.94.8	Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?
PSA.94.9	He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?
PSA.94.10	He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?
PSA.94.11	The 
PSA.94.12	Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O 
PSA.94.13	That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.
PSA.94.14	For the 
PSA.94.15	But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
PSA.94.16	Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
PSA.94.17	Unless the 
PSA.94.18	When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O 
PSA.94.19	In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.
PSA.94.20	Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?
PSA.94.21	They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
PSA.94.22	But the 
PSA.94.23	And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the 
PSA.95.1	O come, let us sing unto the 
PSA.95.2	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
PSA.95.3	For the 
PSA.95.4	In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.
PSA.95.5	The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.
PSA.95.6	O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the 
PSA.95.7	For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,
PSA.95.8	Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
PSA.95.9	When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
PSA.95.10	Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:
PSA.95.11	Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
PSA.96.1	O sing unto the 
PSA.96.2	Sing unto the 
PSA.96.3	Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
PSA.96.4	For the 
PSA.96.5	For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the 
PSA.96.6	Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
PSA.96.7	Give unto the 
PSA.96.8	Give unto the 
PSA.96.9	O worship the 
PSA.96.10	Say among the heathen that the 
PSA.96.11	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.
PSA.96.12	Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
PSA.96.13	Before the 
PSA.97.1	The 
PSA.97.2	Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.
PSA.97.3	A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.
PSA.97.4	His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.
PSA.97.5	The hills melted like wax at the presence of the 
PSA.97.6	The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.
PSA.97.7	Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.
PSA.97.8	Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O 
PSA.97.9	For thou, 
PSA.97.10	Ye that love the 
PSA.97.11	Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
PSA.97.12	Rejoice in the 
PSA.98.1	O sing unto the 
PSA.98.2	The 
PSA.98.3	He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
PSA.98.4	Make a joyful noise unto the 
PSA.98.5	Sing unto the 
PSA.98.6	With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the 
PSA.98.7	Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
PSA.98.8	Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together
PSA.98.9	Before the 
PSA.99.1	The 
PSA.99.2	The 
PSA.99.3	Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.
PSA.99.4	The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
PSA.99.5	Exalt ye the 
PSA.99.6	Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the 
PSA.99.7	He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.
PSA.99.8	Thou answeredst them, O 
PSA.99.9	Exalt the 
PSA.100.1	Make a joyful noise unto the 
PSA.100.2	Serve the 
PSA.100.3	Know ye that the 
PSA.100.4	Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.
PSA.100.5	For the 
PSA.101.1	I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O 
PSA.101.2	I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
PSA.101.3	I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.
PSA.101.4	A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
PSA.101.5	Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.
PSA.101.6	Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
PSA.101.7	He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.
PSA.101.8	I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the 
PSA.102.1	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.102.2	Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.
PSA.102.3	For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.
PSA.102.4	My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.
PSA.102.5	By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.
PSA.102.6	I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.
PSA.102.7	I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
PSA.102.8	Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.
PSA.102.9	For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,
PSA.102.10	Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.
PSA.102.11	My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.
PSA.102.12	But thou, O 
PSA.102.13	Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.
PSA.102.14	For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.
PSA.102.15	So the heathen shall fear the name of the 
PSA.102.16	When the 
PSA.102.17	He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.
PSA.102.18	This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the 
PSA.102.19	For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the 
PSA.102.20	To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;
PSA.102.21	To declare the name of the 
PSA.102.22	When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the 
PSA.102.23	He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.
PSA.102.24	I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.
PSA.102.25	Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.
PSA.102.26	They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
PSA.102.27	But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.
PSA.102.28	The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
PSA.103.1	Bless the 
PSA.103.2	Bless the 
PSA.103.3	Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
PSA.103.4	Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
PSA.103.5	Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
PSA.103.6	The 
PSA.103.7	He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
PSA.103.8	The 
PSA.103.9	He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.
PSA.103.10	He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
PSA.103.11	For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
PSA.103.12	As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
PSA.103.13	Like as a father pitieth his children, so the 
PSA.103.14	For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
PSA.103.15	As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
PSA.103.16	For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.
PSA.103.17	But the mercy of the 
PSA.103.18	To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
PSA.103.19	The 
PSA.103.20	Bless the 
PSA.103.21	Bless ye the 
PSA.103.22	Bless the 
PSA.104.1	Bless the 
PSA.104.2	Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
PSA.104.3	Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
PSA.104.4	Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
PSA.104.5	Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.
PSA.104.6	Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.
PSA.104.7	At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
PSA.104.8	They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
PSA.104.9	Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.
PSA.104.10	He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.
PSA.104.11	They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.
PSA.104.12	By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.
PSA.104.13	He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
PSA.104.14	He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
PSA.104.15	And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.
PSA.104.16	The trees of the 
PSA.104.17	Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
PSA.104.18	The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.
PSA.104.19	He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.
PSA.104.20	Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.
PSA.104.21	The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.
PSA.104.22	The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.
PSA.104.23	Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.
PSA.104.24	O 
PSA.104.25	So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.
PSA.104.26	There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.
PSA.104.27	These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.
PSA.104.28	That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
PSA.104.29	Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
PSA.104.30	Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.
PSA.104.31	The glory of the 
PSA.104.32	He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
PSA.104.33	I will sing unto the 
PSA.104.34	My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the 
PSA.104.35	Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the 
PSA.105.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.105.2	Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.
PSA.105.3	Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the 
PSA.105.4	Seek the 
PSA.105.5	Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
PSA.105.6	O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.
PSA.105.7	He is the 
PSA.105.8	He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.
PSA.105.9	Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
PSA.105.10	And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:
PSA.105.11	Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:
PSA.105.12	When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.
PSA.105.13	When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;
PSA.105.14	He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
PSA.105.15	Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
PSA.105.16	Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.
PSA.105.17	He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:
PSA.105.18	Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
PSA.105.19	Until the time that his word came: the word of the 
PSA.105.20	The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
PSA.105.21	He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
PSA.105.22	To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
PSA.105.23	Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.24	And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
PSA.105.25	He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.
PSA.105.26	He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
PSA.105.27	They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.28	He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
PSA.105.29	He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
PSA.105.30	Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
PSA.105.31	He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.
PSA.105.32	He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
PSA.105.33	He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.
PSA.105.34	He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,
PSA.105.35	And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
PSA.105.36	He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
PSA.105.37	He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.
PSA.105.39	He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.
PSA.105.40	The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
PSA.105.41	He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.
PSA.105.42	For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.
PSA.105.43	And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:
PSA.105.44	And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;
PSA.105.45	That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the 
PSA.106.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.106.2	Who can utter the mighty acts of the 
PSA.106.3	Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.
PSA.106.4	Remember me, O 
PSA.106.5	That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
PSA.106.6	We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
PSA.106.7	Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.
PSA.106.8	Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
PSA.106.9	He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
PSA.106.10	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
PSA.106.11	And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
PSA.106.12	Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
PSA.106.13	They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
PSA.106.14	But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
PSA.106.15	And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
PSA.106.16	They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the 
PSA.106.17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
PSA.106.18	And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
PSA.106.19	They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
PSA.106.20	Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
PSA.106.21	They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;
PSA.106.22	Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.
PSA.106.23	Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
PSA.106.24	Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
PSA.106.25	But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the 
PSA.106.26	Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
PSA.106.27	To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
PSA.106.28	They joined themselves also unto Baal–peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
PSA.106.29	Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
PSA.106.30	Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.
PSA.106.31	And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
PSA.106.32	They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
PSA.106.33	Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
PSA.106.34	They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the 
PSA.106.35	But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
PSA.106.36	And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
PSA.106.37	Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
PSA.106.38	And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
PSA.106.39	Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
PSA.106.40	Therefore was the wrath of the 
PSA.106.41	And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
PSA.106.42	Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
PSA.106.43	Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
PSA.106.44	Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
PSA.106.45	And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
PSA.106.46	He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
PSA.106.47	Save us, O 
PSA.106.48	Blessed be the 
PSA.107.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.107.2	Let the redeemed of the 
PSA.107.3	And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
PSA.107.4	They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
PSA.107.5	Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
PSA.107.6	Then they cried unto the 
PSA.107.7	And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
PSA.107.8	Oh that men would praise the 
PSA.107.9	For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
PSA.107.10	Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;
PSA.107.11	Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:
PSA.107.12	Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.
PSA.107.13	Then they cried unto the 
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.
PSA.107.15	Oh that men would praise the 
PSA.107.16	For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.
PSA.107.17	Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
PSA.107.18	Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.
PSA.107.19	Then they cry unto the 
PSA.107.20	He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.
PSA.107.21	Oh that men would praise the 
PSA.107.22	And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.
PSA.107.23	They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;
PSA.107.24	These see the works of the 
PSA.107.25	For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.
PSA.107.26	They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
PSA.107.27	They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.
PSA.107.28	Then they cry unto the 
PSA.107.29	He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
PSA.107.30	Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
PSA.107.31	Oh that men would praise the 
PSA.107.32	Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
PSA.107.33	He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;
PSA.107.34	A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
PSA.107.35	He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.
PSA.107.36	And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;
PSA.107.37	And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
PSA.107.38	He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
PSA.107.39	Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
PSA.107.40	He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.
PSA.107.41	Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.
PSA.107.42	The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
PSA.107.43	Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the 
PSA.108.1	O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
PSA.108.2	Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
PSA.108.3	I will praise thee, O 
PSA.108.4	For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.
PSA.108.5	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;
PSA.108.6	That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.
PSA.108.7	God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
PSA.108.8	Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
PSA.108.9	Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
PSA.108.11	Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
PSA.108.12	Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
PSA.108.13	Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
PSA.109.1	Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
PSA.109.2	For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
PSA.109.3	They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
PSA.109.4	For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.
PSA.109.5	And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
PSA.109.6	Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.
PSA.109.7	When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
PSA.109.8	Let his days be few; and let another take his office.
PSA.109.9	Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
PSA.109.10	Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.
PSA.109.11	Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.
PSA.109.12	Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.
PSA.109.13	Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
PSA.109.14	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the 
PSA.109.15	Let them be before the 
PSA.109.16	Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
PSA.109.17	As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
PSA.109.18	As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
PSA.109.19	Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
PSA.109.20	Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the 
PSA.109.21	But do thou for me, O 
PSA.109.22	For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
PSA.109.23	I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
PSA.109.24	My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
PSA.109.25	I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.
PSA.109.26	Help me, O 
PSA.109.27	That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, 
PSA.109.28	Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
PSA.109.29	Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
PSA.109.30	I will greatly praise the 
PSA.109.31	For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.
PSA.110.1	The 
PSA.110.2	The 
PSA.110.3	Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.
PSA.110.4	The 
PSA.110.5	The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
PSA.110.6	He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.
PSA.110.7	He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
PSA.111.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.111.2	The works of the 
PSA.111.3	His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
PSA.111.4	He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the 
PSA.111.5	He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.
PSA.111.6	He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
PSA.111.7	The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.
PSA.111.8	They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.
PSA.111.9	He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.
PSA.111.10	The fear of the 
PSA.112.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.112.2	His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
PSA.112.3	Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
PSA.112.4	Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.
PSA.112.5	A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.
PSA.112.6	Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.
PSA.112.7	He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the 
PSA.112.8	His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.
PSA.112.9	He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
PSA.112.10	The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
PSA.113.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.113.2	Blessed be the name of the 
PSA.113.3	From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the 
PSA.113.4	The 
PSA.113.5	Who is like unto the 
PSA.113.6	Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!
PSA.113.7	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
PSA.113.8	That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
PSA.113.9	He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the 
PSA.114.1	When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
PSA.114.2	Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
PSA.114.3	The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
PSA.114.4	The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.
PSA.114.5	What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?
PSA.114.6	Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?
PSA.114.7	Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
PSA.114.8	Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
PSA.115.1	Not unto us, O 
PSA.115.2	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
PSA.115.3	But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.
PSA.115.4	Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
PSA.115.5	They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
PSA.115.6	They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
PSA.115.7	They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
PSA.115.8	They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.
PSA.115.9	O Israel, trust thou in the 
PSA.115.10	O house of Aaron, trust in the 
PSA.115.11	Ye that fear the 
PSA.115.12	The 
PSA.115.13	He will bless them that fear the 
PSA.115.14	The 
PSA.115.15	Ye are blessed of the 
PSA.115.16	The heaven, even the heavens, are the 
PSA.115.17	The dead praise not the 
PSA.115.18	But we will bless the 
PSA.116.1	I love the 
PSA.116.2	Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
PSA.116.3	The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
PSA.116.4	Then called I upon the name of the 
PSA.116.5	Gracious is the 
PSA.116.6	The 
PSA.116.7	Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the 
PSA.116.8	For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
PSA.116.9	I will walk before the 
PSA.116.10	I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
PSA.116.11	I said in my haste, All men are liars.
PSA.116.12	What shall I render unto the 
PSA.116.13	I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the 
PSA.116.14	I will pay my vows unto the 
PSA.116.15	Precious in the sight of the 
PSA.116.16	O 
PSA.116.17	I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the 
PSA.116.18	I will pay my vows unto the 
PSA.116.19	In the courts of the 
PSA.117.1	O praise the 
PSA.117.2	For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the 
PSA.118.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.118.2	Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.118.3	Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.118.4	Let them now that fear the 
PSA.118.5	I called upon the 
PSA.118.6	The 
PSA.118.7	The 
PSA.118.8	It is better to trust in the 
PSA.118.9	It is better to trust in the 
PSA.118.10	All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the 
PSA.118.11	They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the 
PSA.118.12	They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the 
PSA.118.13	Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the 
PSA.118.14	The 
PSA.118.15	The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the 
PSA.118.16	The right hand of the 
PSA.118.17	I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the 
PSA.118.18	The 
PSA.118.19	Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the 
PSA.118.20	This gate of the 
PSA.118.21	I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.
PSA.118.22	The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.
PSA.118.23	This is the 
PSA.118.24	This is the day which the 
PSA.118.25	Save now, I beseech thee, O 
PSA.118.26	Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the 
PSA.118.27	God is the 
PSA.118.28	Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.
PSA.118.29	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.119.1	Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the 
PSA.119.2	Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.
PSA.119.3	They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.
PSA.119.4	Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.
PSA.119.5	O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!
PSA.119.6	Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.
PSA.119.7	I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.
PSA.119.8	I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.
PSA.119.9	Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.
PSA.119.10	With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.
PSA.119.11	Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.
PSA.119.12	Blessed art thou, O 
PSA.119.13	With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.
PSA.119.14	I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.
PSA.119.15	I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.
PSA.119.16	I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.
PSA.119.17	Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.
PSA.119.18	Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.
PSA.119.19	I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.
PSA.119.20	My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.
PSA.119.21	Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.
PSA.119.22	Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.
PSA.119.23	Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.
PSA.119.24	Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.
PSA.119.25	My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.
PSA.119.26	I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.27	Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.
PSA.119.28	My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.
PSA.119.29	Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.
PSA.119.30	I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.
PSA.119.31	I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O 
PSA.119.32	I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.
PSA.119.33	Teach me, O 
PSA.119.34	Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.
PSA.119.35	Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.
PSA.119.36	Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.
PSA.119.37	Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.
PSA.119.38	Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.
PSA.119.39	Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.
PSA.119.40	Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.
PSA.119.41	Let thy mercies come also unto me, O 
PSA.119.42	So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.
PSA.119.43	And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.
PSA.119.44	So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.
PSA.119.45	And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.
PSA.119.46	I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.
PSA.119.47	And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.
PSA.119.48	My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.
PSA.119.49	Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.
PSA.119.50	This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.
PSA.119.51	The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.
PSA.119.52	I remembered thy judgments of old, O 
PSA.119.53	Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
PSA.119.54	Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
PSA.119.55	I have remembered thy name, O 
PSA.119.56	This I had, because I kept thy precepts.
PSA.119.57	Thou art my portion, O 
PSA.119.58	I entreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.
PSA.119.59	I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
PSA.119.60	I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.
PSA.119.61	The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.
PSA.119.62	At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.
PSA.119.63	I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.
PSA.119.64	The earth, O 
PSA.119.65	Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O 
PSA.119.66	Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.
PSA.119.67	Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.
PSA.119.68	Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.69	The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.
PSA.119.70	Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.
PSA.119.71	It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.
PSA.119.72	The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.
PSA.119.73	Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.
PSA.119.74	They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.
PSA.119.75	I know, O 
PSA.119.76	Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.
PSA.119.77	Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.
PSA.119.78	Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.
PSA.119.79	Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.
PSA.119.80	Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.
PSA.119.81	My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.
PSA.119.82	Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?
PSA.119.83	For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.
PSA.119.84	How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
PSA.119.85	The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.
PSA.119.86	All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.
PSA.119.87	They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.
PSA.119.88	Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.
PSA.119.89	For ever, O 
PSA.119.90	Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.
PSA.119.91	They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.
PSA.119.92	Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.
PSA.119.93	I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.
PSA.119.94	I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.
PSA.119.95	The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.
PSA.119.96	I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.
PSA.119.97	O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.
PSA.119.98	Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.
PSA.119.99	I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.
PSA.119.100	I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.
PSA.119.101	I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.
PSA.119.102	I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.
PSA.119.103	How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
PSA.119.104	Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.
PSA.119.105	Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
PSA.119.106	I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.
PSA.119.107	I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O 
PSA.119.108	Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O 
PSA.119.109	My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.
PSA.119.110	The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.
PSA.119.111	Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.
PSA.119.112	I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.
PSA.119.113	I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.
PSA.119.114	Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.
PSA.119.115	Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.
PSA.119.116	Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.
PSA.119.117	Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.
PSA.119.118	Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.
PSA.119.119	Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.
PSA.119.120	My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.
PSA.119.121	I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.
PSA.119.122	Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.
PSA.119.123	Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.
PSA.119.124	Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.125	I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.
PSA.119.126	It is time for thee, 
PSA.119.127	Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.
PSA.119.128	Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.
PSA.119.129	Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.
PSA.119.130	The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.
PSA.119.131	I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.
PSA.119.132	Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.
PSA.119.133	Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
PSA.119.134	Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.
PSA.119.135	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.136	Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.
PSA.119.137	Righteous art thou, O 
PSA.119.138	Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.
PSA.119.139	My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.
PSA.119.140	Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.
PSA.119.141	I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.
PSA.119.142	Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.
PSA.119.143	Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.
PSA.119.144	The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.
PSA.119.145	I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O 
PSA.119.146	I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.
PSA.119.147	I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.
PSA.119.148	Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.
PSA.119.149	Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O 
PSA.119.150	They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.
PSA.119.151	Thou art near, O 
PSA.119.152	Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.
PSA.119.153	Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.
PSA.119.154	Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.
PSA.119.155	Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.
PSA.119.156	Great are thy tender mercies, O 
PSA.119.157	Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.
PSA.119.158	I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.
PSA.119.159	Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O 
PSA.119.160	Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.
PSA.119.161	Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.
PSA.119.162	I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.
PSA.119.163	I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.
PSA.119.164	Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.
PSA.119.165	Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.
PSA.119.167	My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.
PSA.119.168	I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.
PSA.119.169	Let my cry come near before thee, O 
PSA.119.170	Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.
PSA.119.171	My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.
PSA.119.172	My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.
PSA.119.173	Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.
PSA.119.174	I have longed for thy salvation, O 
PSA.119.175	Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.
PSA.119.176	I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.
PSA.120.1	In my distress I cried unto the 
PSA.120.2	Deliver my soul, O 
PSA.120.3	What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?
PSA.120.4	Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
PSA.120.5	Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
PSA.120.6	My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
PSA.120.7	I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.
PSA.121.1	I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
PSA.121.2	My help cometh from the 
PSA.121.3	He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.
PSA.121.4	Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.6	The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
PSA.121.7	The 
PSA.121.8	The 
PSA.122.1	I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the 
PSA.122.2	Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:
PSA.122.4	Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the 
PSA.122.5	For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
PSA.122.6	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
PSA.122.7	Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.
PSA.122.8	For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.
PSA.122.9	Because of the house of the 
PSA.123.1	Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
PSA.123.2	Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the 
PSA.123.3	Have mercy upon us, O 
PSA.123.4	Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
PSA.124.1	If it had not been the 
PSA.124.2	If it had not been the 
PSA.124.3	Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:
PSA.124.4	Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:
PSA.124.5	Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
PSA.124.6	Blessed be the 
PSA.124.7	Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
PSA.124.8	Our help is in the name of the 
PSA.125.1	They that trust in the 
PSA.125.2	As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the 
PSA.125.3	For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
PSA.125.4	Do good, O 
PSA.125.5	As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the 
PSA.126.1	When the 
PSA.126.2	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The 
PSA.126.3	The 
PSA.126.4	Turn again our captivity, O 
PSA.126.5	They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
PSA.126.6	He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
PSA.127.1	Except the 
PSA.127.2	It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
PSA.127.3	Lo, children are an heritage of the 
PSA.127.4	As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.
PSA.127.5	Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
PSA.128.1	Blessed is every one that feareth the 
PSA.128.2	For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
PSA.128.3	Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
PSA.128.4	Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the 
PSA.128.5	The 
PSA.128.6	Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.
PSA.129.1	Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:
PSA.129.2	Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.
PSA.129.3	The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.
PSA.129.4	The 
PSA.129.5	Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
PSA.129.6	Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:
PSA.129.7	Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
PSA.129.8	Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the 
PSA.130.1	Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O 
PSA.130.2	Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
PSA.130.3	If thou, 
PSA.130.4	But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
PSA.130.5	I wait for the 
PSA.130.6	My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.
PSA.130.7	Let Israel hope in the 
PSA.130.8	And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
PSA.131.2	Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
PSA.131.3	Let Israel hope in the 
PSA.132.2	How he sware unto the 
PSA.132.3	Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;
PSA.132.4	I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,
PSA.132.5	Until I find out a place for the 
PSA.132.6	Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.
PSA.132.7	We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.
PSA.132.8	Arise, O 
PSA.132.9	Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.
PSA.132.10	For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.
PSA.132.11	The 
PSA.132.12	If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.
PSA.132.13	For the 
PSA.132.14	This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
PSA.132.15	I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.
PSA.132.16	I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
PSA.132.17	There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
PSA.132.18	His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
PSA.133.1	Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
PSA.133.2	It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;
PSA.133.3	As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the 
PSA.134.1	Behold, bless ye the 
PSA.134.2	Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the 
PSA.134.3	The 
PSA.135.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.135.2	Ye that stand in the house of the 
PSA.135.3	Praise the 
PSA.135.4	For the 
PSA.135.5	For I know that the 
PSA.135.6	Whatsoever the 
PSA.135.7	He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.
PSA.135.8	Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
PSA.135.9	Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
PSA.135.10	Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
PSA.135.11	Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:
PSA.135.12	And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.
PSA.135.13	Thy name, O 
PSA.135.14	For the 
PSA.135.15	The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
PSA.135.16	They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
PSA.135.17	They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.
PSA.135.18	They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.
PSA.135.19	Bless the 
PSA.135.20	Bless the 
PSA.135.21	Blessed be the 
PSA.136.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.136.2	O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.136.3	O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.136.4	To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.136.5	To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.136.6	To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.136.7	To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever:
PSA.136.8	The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:
PSA.136.9	The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.136.10	To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever:
PSA.136.11	And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever:
PSA.136.12	With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.136.13	To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever:
PSA.136.14	And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever:
PSA.136.15	But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.136.16	To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.136.17	To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:
PSA.136.18	And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:
PSA.136.19	Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:
PSA.136.20	And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:
PSA.136.21	And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever:
PSA.136.22	Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.136.23	Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for ever:
PSA.136.24	And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.136.25	Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.136.26	O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.
PSA.137.1	By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
PSA.137.2	We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
PSA.137.3	For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
PSA.137.4	How shall we sing the 
PSA.137.5	If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.
PSA.137.6	If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.
PSA.137.7	Remember, O 
PSA.137.8	O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
PSA.137.9	Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
PSA.138.1	I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.
PSA.138.2	I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
PSA.138.3	In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.
PSA.138.4	All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O 
PSA.138.5	Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the 
PSA.138.6	Though the 
PSA.138.7	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.
PSA.138.8	The 
PSA.139.1	O 
PSA.139.2	Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
PSA.139.3	Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.
PSA.139.4	For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O 
PSA.139.5	Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.
PSA.139.6	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.
PSA.139.7	Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
PSA.139.8	If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
PSA.139.9	If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
PSA.139.10	Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
PSA.139.11	If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.
PSA.139.12	Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
PSA.139.13	For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
PSA.139.14	I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.
PSA.139.15	My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
PSA.139.16	Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
PSA.139.17	How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!
PSA.139.18	If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.
PSA.139.19	Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
PSA.139.20	For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.
PSA.139.21	Do not I hate them, O 
PSA.139.22	I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
PSA.139.23	Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
PSA.139.24	And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
PSA.140.1	Deliver me, O 
PSA.140.2	Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war.
PSA.140.3	They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.
PSA.140.4	Keep me, O 
PSA.140.5	The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.
PSA.140.6	I said unto the 
PSA.140.7	O 
PSA.140.8	Grant not, O 
PSA.140.9	As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
PSA.140.10	Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
PSA.140.11	Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
PSA.140.12	I know that the 
PSA.140.13	Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
PSA.141.2	Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
PSA.141.3	Set a watch, O 
PSA.141.4	Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.
PSA.141.5	Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.
PSA.141.6	When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
PSA.141.7	Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.
PSA.141.8	But mine eyes are unto thee, O 
PSA.141.9	Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.
PSA.141.10	Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
PSA.142.1	I cried unto the 
PSA.142.2	I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.
PSA.142.3	When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
PSA.142.4	I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.
PSA.142.5	I cried unto thee, O 
PSA.142.6	Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
PSA.142.7	Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
PSA.143.1	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.143.2	And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
PSA.143.3	For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
PSA.143.4	Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.
PSA.143.5	I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.
PSA.143.6	I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.
PSA.143.7	Hear me speedily, O 
PSA.143.8	Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.
PSA.143.9	Deliver me, O 
PSA.143.10	Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.
PSA.143.11	Quicken me, O 
PSA.143.12	And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.
PSA.144.1	Blessed be the 
PSA.144.2	My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.
PSA.144.4	Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.
PSA.144.5	Bow thy heavens, O 
PSA.144.6	Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.
PSA.144.7	Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;
PSA.144.8	Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
PSA.144.9	I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
PSA.144.10	It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
PSA.144.11	Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:
PSA.144.12	That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:
PSA.144.13	That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:
PSA.144.14	That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.
PSA.144.15	Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the 
PSA.145.1	I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
PSA.145.2	Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
PSA.145.3	Great is the 
PSA.145.4	One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.
PSA.145.5	I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.
PSA.145.6	And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness.
PSA.145.7	They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.
PSA.145.8	The 
PSA.145.9	The 
PSA.145.10	All thy works shall praise thee, O 
PSA.145.11	They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;
PSA.145.12	To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.
PSA.145.13	Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
PSA.145.14	The 
PSA.145.15	The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.
PSA.145.16	Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
PSA.145.17	The 
PSA.145.18	The 
PSA.145.19	He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
PSA.145.20	The 
PSA.145.21	My mouth shall speak the praise of the 
PSA.146.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.146.2	While I live will I praise the 
PSA.146.3	Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
PSA.146.4	His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
PSA.146.5	Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the 
PSA.146.6	Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:
PSA.146.7	Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The 
PSA.146.8	The 
PSA.146.9	The 
PSA.146.10	The 
PSA.147.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.147.2	The 
PSA.147.3	He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.
PSA.147.4	He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.
PSA.147.5	Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.
PSA.147.6	The 
PSA.147.7	Sing unto the 
PSA.147.8	Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.
PSA.147.9	He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.
PSA.147.10	He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.
PSA.147.11	The 
PSA.147.12	Praise the 
PSA.147.13	For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.
PSA.147.14	He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.
PSA.147.15	He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.
PSA.147.16	He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.
PSA.147.17	He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?
PSA.147.18	He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
PSA.147.19	He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.
PSA.147.20	He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the 
PSA.148.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.148.2	Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.
PSA.148.3	Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.
PSA.148.4	Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens.
PSA.148.5	Let them praise the name of the 
PSA.148.6	He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.
PSA.148.7	Praise the 
PSA.148.8	Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word:
PSA.148.9	Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:
PSA.148.10	Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:
PSA.148.11	Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:
PSA.148.12	Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:
PSA.148.13	Let them praise the name of the 
PSA.148.14	He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the 
PSA.149.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.149.2	Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
PSA.149.3	Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.
PSA.149.4	For the 
PSA.149.5	Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.
PSA.149.6	Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand;
PSA.149.7	To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people;
PSA.149.8	To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;
PSA.149.9	To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the 
PSA.150.1	Praise ye the 
PSA.150.2	Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.
PSA.150.3	Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp.
PSA.150.4	Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.
PSA.150.5	Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.
PSA.150.6	Let every thing that hath breath praise the 
PRO.1.1	The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
PRO.1.2	To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
PRO.1.3	To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
PRO.1.4	To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
PRO.1.5	A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
PRO.1.6	To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
PRO.1.7	The fear of the 
PRO.1.8	My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
PRO.1.9	For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.
PRO.1.10	My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
PRO.1.11	If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:
PRO.1.12	Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
PRO.1.13	We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
PRO.1.14	Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:
PRO.1.15	My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:
PRO.1.16	For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
PRO.1.17	Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
PRO.1.18	And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.
PRO.1.19	So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
PRO.1.20	Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:
PRO.1.21	She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,
PRO.1.22	How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
PRO.1.23	Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
PRO.1.24	Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
PRO.1.25	But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
PRO.1.26	I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
PRO.1.27	When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
PRO.1.28	Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
PRO.1.29	For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the 
PRO.1.30	They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
PRO.1.31	Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
PRO.1.32	For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
PRO.1.33	But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
PRO.2.1	My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;
PRO.2.2	So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;
PRO.2.3	Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;
PRO.2.4	If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;
PRO.2.5	Then shalt thou understand the fear of the 
PRO.2.6	For the 
PRO.2.7	He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
PRO.2.8	He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.
PRO.2.9	Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.
PRO.2.10	When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;
PRO.2.11	Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:
PRO.2.12	To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;
PRO.2.13	Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
PRO.2.14	Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
PRO.2.15	Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:
PRO.2.16	To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;
PRO.2.17	Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.
PRO.2.18	For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.
PRO.2.19	None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.
PRO.2.20	That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.
PRO.2.21	For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
PRO.2.22	But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
PRO.3.1	My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:
PRO.3.2	For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
PRO.3.3	Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:
PRO.3.4	So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
PRO.3.5	Trust in the 
PRO.3.6	In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
PRO.3.7	Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the 
PRO.3.8	It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.
PRO.3.9	Honour the 
PRO.3.10	So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
PRO.3.11	My son, despise not the chastening of the 
PRO.3.12	For whom the 
PRO.3.13	Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.
PRO.3.14	For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
PRO.3.15	She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
PRO.3.16	Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.
PRO.3.17	Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
PRO.3.18	She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.
PRO.3.19	The 
PRO.3.20	By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.
PRO.3.21	My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:
PRO.3.22	So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.
PRO.3.23	Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
PRO.3.24	When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
PRO.3.25	Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
PRO.3.26	For the 
PRO.3.27	Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.
PRO.3.28	Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.
PRO.3.29	Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
PRO.3.30	Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
PRO.3.31	Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
PRO.3.32	For the froward is abomination to the 
PRO.3.33	The curse of the 
PRO.3.34	Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.
PRO.3.35	The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
PRO.4.1	Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
PRO.4.2	For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.
PRO.4.3	For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
PRO.4.4	He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.
PRO.4.5	Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.
PRO.4.6	Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.
PRO.4.7	Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.
PRO.4.8	Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.
PRO.4.9	She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
PRO.4.10	Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.
PRO.4.11	I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.
PRO.4.12	When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
PRO.4.13	Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.
PRO.4.14	Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.
PRO.4.15	Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
PRO.4.16	For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
PRO.4.17	For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
PRO.4.18	But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
PRO.4.19	The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.
PRO.4.20	My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.
PRO.4.21	Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.
PRO.4.22	For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.
PRO.4.23	Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.
PRO.4.24	Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.
PRO.4.25	Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
PRO.4.26	Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
PRO.4.27	Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.
PRO.5.1	My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:
PRO.5.2	That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.
PRO.5.3	For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
PRO.5.4	But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
PRO.5.6	Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.
PRO.5.7	Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
PRO.5.8	Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:
PRO.5.9	Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:
PRO.5.10	Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;
PRO.5.11	And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
PRO.5.12	And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
PRO.5.13	And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
PRO.5.14	I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
PRO.5.15	Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.
PRO.5.16	Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.
PRO.5.17	Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.
PRO.5.18	Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
PRO.5.19	Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
PRO.5.20	And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
PRO.5.21	For the ways of man are before the eyes of the 
PRO.5.22	His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
PRO.5.23	He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
PRO.6.1	My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
PRO.6.2	Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
PRO.6.3	Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
PRO.6.4	Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
PRO.6.5	Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
PRO.6.6	Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
PRO.6.7	Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
PRO.6.8	Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.
PRO.6.9	How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
PRO.6.10	Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
PRO.6.11	So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.
PRO.6.12	A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.
PRO.6.13	He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
PRO.6.14	Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.
PRO.6.15	Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
PRO.6.16	These six things doth the 
PRO.6.17	A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
PRO.6.18	An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
PRO.6.19	A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.
PRO.6.20	My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
PRO.6.21	Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.
PRO.6.22	When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
PRO.6.23	For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
PRO.6.24	To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
PRO.6.25	Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
PRO.6.26	For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.
PRO.6.27	Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
PRO.6.28	Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
PRO.6.29	So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
PRO.6.30	Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
PRO.6.31	But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
PRO.6.32	But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
PRO.6.33	A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
PRO.6.34	For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
PRO.6.35	He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
PRO.7.1	My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
PRO.7.2	Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.
PRO.7.3	Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.
PRO.7.4	Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:
PRO.7.5	That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.
PRO.7.6	For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
PRO.7.7	And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
PRO.7.8	Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
PRO.7.9	In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
PRO.7.10	And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.
PRO.7.11	(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
PRO.7.12	Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)
PRO.7.13	So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,
PRO.7.14	I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.
PRO.7.15	Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
PRO.7.16	I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.
PRO.7.17	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.
PRO.7.19	For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:
PRO.7.20	He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.
PRO.7.21	With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
PRO.7.22	He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
PRO.7.23	Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.
PRO.7.24	Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
PRO.7.25	Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
PRO.7.26	For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.
PRO.7.27	Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
PRO.8.1	Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?
PRO.8.2	She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.
PRO.8.3	She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.
PRO.8.4	Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.
PRO.8.5	O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.
PRO.8.6	Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.
PRO.8.7	For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
PRO.8.8	All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.
PRO.8.9	They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.
PRO.8.10	Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.
PRO.8.11	For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
PRO.8.12	I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.
PRO.8.13	The fear of the 
PRO.8.14	Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.
PRO.8.15	By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
PRO.8.16	By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.
PRO.8.17	I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.
PRO.8.18	Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.
PRO.8.19	My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
PRO.8.20	I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:
PRO.8.21	That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
PRO.8.22	The 
PRO.8.23	I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
PRO.8.24	When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.
PRO.8.25	Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:
PRO.8.26	While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
PRO.8.27	When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:
PRO.8.28	When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
PRO.8.29	When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
PRO.8.30	Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;
PRO.8.31	Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.
PRO.8.32	Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.
PRO.8.33	Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
PRO.8.34	Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
PRO.8.35	For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the 
PRO.8.36	But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
PRO.9.1	Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:
PRO.9.2	She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.
PRO.9.3	She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,
PRO.9.4	Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
PRO.9.5	Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.
PRO.9.6	Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
PRO.9.7	He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.
PRO.9.8	Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
PRO.9.9	Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.
PRO.9.10	The fear of the 
PRO.9.11	For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
PRO.9.12	If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.
PRO.9.13	A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.
PRO.9.14	For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
PRO.9.15	To call passengers who go right on their ways:
PRO.9.16	Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
PRO.9.17	Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
PRO.9.18	But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.

PRO.10.14	Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.
PRO.10.15	The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.
PRO.10.16	The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.
PRO.10.17	He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.
PRO.10.18	He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.
PRO.10.19	In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.

PRO.15.26	The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the 
PRO.15.27	He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.
PRO.15.28	The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.
PRO.15.29	The 
PRO.15.30	The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh the bones fat.
PRO.15.31	The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.
PRO.15.32	He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.
PRO.15.33	The fear of the 
PRO.16.1	The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the 
PRO.16.2	All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the 
PRO.16.3	Commit thy works unto the 
PRO.16.4	The

PRO.16.8	Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.
PRO.16.9	A man's heart deviseth his way: but the 
PRO.16.10	A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.
PRO.16.11	A just weight and balance are the 
PRO.16.12	It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.
PRO.16.13	Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.
PRO.16.14	The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.
PRO.16.15	In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.
PRO.16.16	How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!
PRO.16.17	The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.
PRO.16.18	Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.
PRO.16.19	Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.
PRO.16.20	He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the 
PRO.16.21	The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.
PRO.16.22	Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.
PRO.16.23	The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.
PRO.16.24	Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
PRO.16.25	There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.
PRO.16.26	He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.
PRO.16.27	An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.
PRO.16.28	A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.
PRO.16.29	A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.
PRO.16.30	He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.
PRO.16.31	The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.
PRO.16.32	He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
PRO.16.33	The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the 
PRO.17.1	Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.
PRO.17.2	A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.
PRO.17.3	The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the 
PRO.17.4	A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.
PRO.17.5	Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.
PRO.17.6	Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.
PRO.17.7	Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.
PRO.17.8	A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
PRO.17.9	He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.
PRO.17.10	A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.
PRO.17.11	An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
PRO.17.12	Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.
PRO.17.13	Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.
PRO.17.14	The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.
PRO.17.15	He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the 
PRO.17.16	Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?
PRO.17.17	A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.
PRO.17.18	A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend.
PRO.17.19	He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.
PRO.17.20	He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.
PRO.17.21	He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.
PRO.17.22	A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.
PRO.17.23	A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.
PRO.17.24	Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.
PRO.17.25	A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.
PRO.17.26	Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.
PRO.17.27	He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.
PRO.17.28	Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.
PRO.18.1	Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.
PRO.18.2	A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.
PRO.18.3	When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.
PRO.18.4	The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.
PRO.18.5	It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.
PRO.18.6	A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.
PRO.18.7	A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.
PRO.18.8	The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
PRO.18.9	He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.
PRO.18.10	The name of the 
PRO.18.11	The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.
PRO.18.12	Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.
PRO.18.13	He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.
PRO.18.14	The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?

PRO.18.16	A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.
PRO.18.17	He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.
PRO.18.18	The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.
PRO.18.19	A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.
PRO.18.20	A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.
PRO.18.21	Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
PRO.18.22	Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the 
PRO.18.23	The poor useth entreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.
PRO.18.24	A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
PRO.19.1	Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.
PRO.19.2	Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.
PRO.19.3	The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the 
PRO.19.4	Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.
PRO.19.5	A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.
PRO.19.6	Many will entreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.
PRO.19.7	All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.
PRO.19.8	He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.
PRO.19.9	A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.
PRO.19.10	Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.

PRO.19.12	The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.
PRO.19.13	A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.
PRO.19.14	House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the 
PRO.19.15	Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.
PRO.19.16	He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.
PRO.19.17	He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the 
PRO.19.18	Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.
PRO.19.19	A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.
PRO.19.20	Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.
PRO.19.21	There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the

PRO.19.24	A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
PRO.19.25	Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.
PRO.19.26	He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.
PRO.19.27	Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.
PRO.19.28	An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.
PRO.19.29	Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
PRO.20.1	Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.
PRO.20.2	The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.
PRO.20.3	It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.
PRO.20.4	The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.
PRO.20.5	Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.
PRO.20.6	Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?
PRO.20.7	The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him.
PRO.20.8	A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.
PRO.20.9	Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?
PRO.20.10	Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the 
PRO.20.11	Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.
PRO.20.12	The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the 
PRO.20.13	Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.
PRO.20.14	It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.
PRO.20.15	There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
PRO.20.16	Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
PRO.20.17	Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
PRO.20.18	Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.
PRO.20.19	He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.
PRO.20.20	Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.
PRO.20.21	An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.
PRO.20.22	Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the 
PRO.20.23	Divers weights are an abomination unto the 
PRO.20.24	Man's goings are of the 
PRO.20.25	It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry.
PRO.20.26	A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.
PRO.20.27	The spirit of man is the candle of the 
PRO.20.28	Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.
PRO.20.29	The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the gray head.
PRO.20.30	The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.
PRO.21.1	The king's heart is in the hand of the 
PRO.21.2	Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the 
PRO.21.3	To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the 
PRO.21.4	An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin.
PRO.21.5	The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.
PRO.21.6	The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.
PRO.21.7	The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.
PRO.21.8	The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.
PRO.21.9	It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.
PRO.21.10	The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.
PRO.21.11	When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.
PRO.21.12	The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.
PRO.21.13	Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.
PRO.21.14	A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.
PRO.21.15	It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.
PRO.21.16	The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.
PRO.21.17	He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.
PRO.21.18	The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.
PRO.21.19	It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.
PRO.21.20	There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.
PRO.21.21	He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.
PRO.21.22	A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.
PRO.21.23	Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.
PRO.21.24	Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.
PRO.21.25	The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.
PRO.21.26	He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.
PRO.21.27	The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?
PRO.21.28	A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.
PRO.21.29	A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way.
PRO.21.30	There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the 
PRO.21.31	The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the 
PRO.22.1	A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold.
PRO.22.2	The rich and poor meet together: the 
PRO.22.3	A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.
PRO.22.4	By humility and the fear of the 
PRO.22.5	Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.
PRO.22.6	Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.
PRO.22.7	The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.
PRO.22.8	He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.
PRO.22.9	He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor.
PRO.22.10	Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.
PRO.22.11	He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend.
PRO.22.12	The eyes of the 
PRO.22.13	The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.
PRO.22.14	The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the 
PRO.22.15	Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.
PRO.22.16	He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.
PRO.22.17	Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.
PRO.22.18	For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.
PRO.22.19	That thy trust may be in the 
PRO.22.20	Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,
PRO.22.21	That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?
PRO.22.22	Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:
PRO.22.23	For the 
PRO.22.24	Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:
PRO.22.25	Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.
PRO.22.26	Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts.
PRO.22.27	If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?
PRO.22.28	Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.
PRO.22.29	Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.
PRO.23.1	When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee:
PRO.23.2	And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.
PRO.23.3	Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.
PRO.23.4	Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.
PRO.23.5	Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.
PRO.23.6	Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:
PRO.23.7	For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.
PRO.23.8	The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.
PRO.23.9	Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.
PRO.23.10	Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:
PRO.23.11	For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.
PRO.23.12	Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.
PRO.23.13	Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.
PRO.23.14	Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.
PRO.23.15	My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.
PRO.23.16	Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.
PRO.23.17	Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the 
PRO.23.18	For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.
PRO.23.19	Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.
PRO.23.20	Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:
PRO.23.21	For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.
PRO.23.22	Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.
PRO.23.23	Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.
PRO.23.24	The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.
PRO.23.25	Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.
PRO.23.26	My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.
PRO.23.27	For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.
PRO.23.28	She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.
PRO.23.29	Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?
PRO.23.30	They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.
PRO.23.31	Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.
PRO.23.32	At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.
PRO.23.33	Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.
PRO.23.34	Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.
PRO.23.35	They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
PRO.24.1	Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.
PRO.24.2	For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.
PRO.24.3	Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:
PRO.24.4	And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.
PRO.24.5	A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.
PRO.24.6	For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety.
PRO.24.7	Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.
PRO.24.8	He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.
PRO.24.9	The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men.
PRO.24.10	If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.
PRO.24.11	If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain;
PRO.24.12	If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works?
PRO.24.13	My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:
PRO.24.14	So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.
PRO.24.15	Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:
PRO.24.16	For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.
PRO.24.17	Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:
PRO.24.18	Lest the 
PRO.24.19	Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked;
PRO.24.20	For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.
PRO.24.21	My son, fear thou the 
PRO.24.22	For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?
PRO.24.23	These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.
PRO.24.24	He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:
PRO.24.25	But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.
PRO.24.26	Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.
PRO.24.27	Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.
PRO.24.28	Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips.
PRO.24.29	Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.
PRO.24.30	I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
PRO.24.31	And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.
PRO.24.32	Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.
PRO.24.33	Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
PRO.24.34	So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.
PRO.25.1	These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
PRO.25.2	It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.
PRO.25.3	The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.
PRO.25.4	Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
PRO.25.5	Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
PRO.25.6	Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:
PRO.25.7	For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.
PRO.25.8	Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.
PRO.25.9	Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:
PRO.25.10	Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.
PRO.25.11	A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.
PRO.25.12	As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
PRO.25.13	As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.
PRO.25.14	Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.
PRO.25.15	By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
PRO.25.16	Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
PRO.25.17	Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.
PRO.25.18	A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
PRO.25.19	Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
PRO.25.20	As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.
PRO.25.21	If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
PRO.25.22	For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the 
PRO.25.23	The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
PRO.25.24	It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
PRO.25.25	As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.
PRO.25.26	A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.
PRO.25.27	It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.
PRO.25.28	He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.
PRO.26.1	As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.
PRO.26.2	As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.
PRO.26.3	A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.
PRO.26.4	Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.
PRO.26.5	Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.
PRO.26.6	He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage.
PRO.26.7	The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
PRO.26.8	As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool.
PRO.26.9	As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
PRO.26.10	The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.
PRO.26.11	As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly.
PRO.26.12	Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.
PRO.26.13	The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.
PRO.26.14	As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed.
PRO.26.15	The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.
PRO.26.16	The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.
PRO.26.17	He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.
PRO.26.18	As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,
PRO.26.19	So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?
PRO.26.20	Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.
PRO.26.21	As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.
PRO.26.22	The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
PRO.26.23	Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.
PRO.26.24	He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;
PRO.26.25	When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.
PRO.26.26	Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation.
PRO.26.27	Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.
PRO.26.28	A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
PRO.27.1	Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
PRO.27.2	Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.
PRO.27.3	A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.
PRO.27.4	Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?
PRO.27.5	Open rebuke is better than secret love.
PRO.27.6	Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.
PRO.27.7	The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
PRO.27.8	As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.
PRO.27.9	Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.
PRO.27.10	Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.
PRO.27.11	My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.
PRO.27.12	A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.
PRO.27.13	Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
PRO.27.14	He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
PRO.27.15	A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
PRO.27.16	Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.
PRO.27.17	Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
PRO.27.18	Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.
PRO.27.19	As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.
PRO.27.20	Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
PRO.27.21	As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.
PRO.27.22	Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
PRO.27.23	Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.
PRO.27.24	For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation?
PRO.27.25	The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.
PRO.27.26	The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.
PRO.27.27	And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.
PRO.28.1	The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.
PRO.28.2	For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.
PRO.28.3	A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.
PRO.28.4	They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.
PRO.28.5	Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the 
PRO.28.6	Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.
PRO.28.7	Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.
PRO.28.8	He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.
PRO.28.9	He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.
PRO.28.10	Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession.
PRO.28.11	The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.
PRO.28.12	When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.
PRO.28.13	He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.
PRO.28.14	Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.
PRO.28.15	As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.
PRO.28.16	The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.
PRO.28.17	A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.
PRO.28.18	Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.
PRO.28.19	He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.
PRO.28.20	A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.
PRO.28.21	To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress.
PRO.28.22	He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.
PRO.28.23	He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.
PRO.28.24	Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.
PRO.28.25	He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the 
PRO.28.26	He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
PRO.28.27	He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.
PRO.28.28	When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
PRO.29.1	He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.
PRO.29.2	When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.
PRO.29.3	Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance.
PRO.29.4	The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.
PRO.29.5	A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.
PRO.29.6	In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.
PRO.29.7	The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it.
PRO.29.8	Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath.
PRO.29.9	If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.
PRO.29.10	The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.
PRO.29.11	A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards.
PRO.29.12	If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.
PRO.29.13	The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the 
PRO.29.14	The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.
PRO.29.15	The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.
PRO.29.16	When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.
PRO.29.17	Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.
PRO.29.18	Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.
PRO.29.19	A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.
PRO.29.20	Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.
PRO.29.21	He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length.
PRO.29.22	An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.
PRO.29.23	A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.
PRO.29.24	Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.
PRO.29.25	The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the 
PRO.29.26	Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from the 
PRO.29.27	An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.
PRO.30.1	The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,
PRO.30.2	Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.
PRO.30.3	I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.
PRO.30.4	Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?
PRO.30.5	Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.
PRO.30.6	Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
PRO.30.7	Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:
PRO.30.8	Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:
PRO.30.9	Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the 
PRO.30.10	Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.
PRO.30.11	There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.
PRO.30.12	There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.
PRO.30.13	There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.
PRO.30.14	There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
PRO.30.15	The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:
PRO.30.16	The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.
PRO.30.17	The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.
PRO.30.18	There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:
PRO.30.19	The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
PRO.30.20	Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.
PRO.30.21	For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:
PRO.30.22	For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;
PRO.30.23	For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
PRO.30.24	There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:
PRO.30.25	The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;
PRO.30.26	The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;
PRO.30.27	The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;
PRO.30.28	The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.
PRO.30.29	There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:
PRO.30.30	A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;
PRO.30.31	A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.
PRO.30.32	If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.
PRO.30.33	Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
PRO.31.1	The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.
PRO.31.2	What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?
PRO.31.3	Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.
PRO.31.4	It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:
PRO.31.5	Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
PRO.31.6	Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
PRO.31.7	Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
PRO.31.8	Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.
PRO.31.9	Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
PRO.31.10	Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.
PRO.31.11	The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.
PRO.31.12	She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
PRO.31.13	She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.
PRO.31.14	She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.
PRO.31.15	She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
PRO.31.16	She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
PRO.31.17	She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.
PRO.31.18	She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.
PRO.31.19	She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.
PRO.31.20	She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
PRO.31.21	She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
PRO.31.22	She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.
PRO.31.23	Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.
PRO.31.24	She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.
PRO.31.25	Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.
PRO.31.26	She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.
PRO.31.27	She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
PRO.31.28	Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.
PRO.31.29	Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.
PRO.31.30	Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the 
PRO.31.31	Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
ECC.1.1	The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
ECC.1.2	Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.
ECC.1.3	What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?
ECC.1.4	One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.
ECC.1.5	The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.
ECC.1.6	The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.
ECC.1.7	All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
ECC.1.8	All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
ECC.1.9	The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.
ECC.1.10	Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.
ECC.1.11	There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.
ECC.1.12	I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
ECC.1.13	And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
ECC.1.14	I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
ECC.1.15	That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
ECC.1.16	I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
ECC.1.17	And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.
ECC.1.18	For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
ECC.2.1	I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.
ECC.2.2	I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?
ECC.2.3	I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.
ECC.2.4	I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:
ECC.2.5	I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:
ECC.2.6	I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:
ECC.2.7	I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:
ECC.2.8	I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
ECC.2.9	So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
ECC.2.10	And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.
ECC.2.11	Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.
ECC.2.12	And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done.
ECC.2.13	Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
ECC.2.14	The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.
ECC.2.15	Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.
ECC.2.16	For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.
ECC.2.17	Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
ECC.2.18	Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
ECC.2.19	And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.
ECC.2.20	Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.
ECC.2.21	For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
ECC.2.22	For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?
ECC.2.23	For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
ECC.2.24	There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.
ECC.2.25	For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?
ECC.2.26	For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.
ECC.3.1	To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
ECC.3.2	A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
ECC.3.3	A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
ECC.3.4	A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
ECC.3.5	A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
ECC.3.6	A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
ECC.3.7	A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
ECC.3.8	A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
ECC.3.9	What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
ECC.3.10	I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.
ECC.3.11	He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.
ECC.3.12	I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.
ECC.3.13	And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.
ECC.3.14	I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.
ECC.3.15	That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.
ECC.3.16	And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.
ECC.3.17	I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.
ECC.3.18	I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
ECC.3.19	For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.
ECC.3.20	All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
ECC.3.21	Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?
ECC.3.22	Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
ECC.4.1	So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.
ECC.4.2	Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.
ECC.4.3	Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
ECC.4.4	Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.
ECC.4.5	The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
ECC.4.6	Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.
ECC.4.7	Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.
ECC.4.8	There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.
ECC.4.9	Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.
ECC.4.10	For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.
ECC.4.11	Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?
ECC.4.12	And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
ECC.4.13	Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.
ECC.4.14	For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.
ECC.4.15	I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.
ECC.4.16	There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.
ECC.5.1	Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.
ECC.5.2	Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.
ECC.5.3	For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words.
ECC.5.4	When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.
ECC.5.5	Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.
ECC.5.6	Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?
ECC.5.7	For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God.
ECC.5.8	If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.
ECC.5.9	Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field.
ECC.5.10	He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.
ECC.5.11	When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?
ECC.5.12	The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
ECC.5.13	There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.
ECC.5.14	But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand.
ECC.5.15	As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.
ECC.5.16	And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?
ECC.5.17	All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.
ECC.5.18	Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion.
ECC.5.19	Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.
ECC.5.20	For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.
ECC.6.1	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:
ECC.6.2	A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.
ECC.6.3	If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.
ECC.6.4	For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.
ECC.6.5	Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other.
ECC.6.6	Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?
ECC.6.7	All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.
ECC.6.8	For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?
ECC.6.9	Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.
ECC.6.10	That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.
ECC.6.11	Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?
ECC.6.12	For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
ECC.7.1	A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.
ECC.7.2	It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.
ECC.7.3	Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
ECC.7.4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
ECC.7.5	It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.
ECC.7.6	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.
ECC.7.7	Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.
ECC.7.8	Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
ECC.7.9	Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.
ECC.7.10	Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.
ECC.7.11	Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.
ECC.7.12	For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
ECC.7.13	Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?
ECC.7.14	In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
ECC.7.15	All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.
ECC.7.16	Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?
ECC.7.17	Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?
ECC.7.18	It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.
ECC.7.19	Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.
ECC.7.20	For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
ECC.7.21	Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:
ECC.7.22	For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.
ECC.7.23	All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.
ECC.7.24	That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
ECC.7.25	I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness:
ECC.7.26	And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.
ECC.7.27	Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:
ECC.7.28	Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.
ECC.7.29	Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
ECC.8.1	Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.
ECC.8.2	I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.
ECC.8.3	Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.
ECC.8.4	Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?
ECC.8.5	Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.
ECC.8.6	Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.
ECC.8.7	For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?
ECC.8.8	There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
ECC.8.9	All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.
ECC.8.10	And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.
ECC.8.11	Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
ECC.8.12	Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:
ECC.8.13	But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.
ECC.8.14	There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.
ECC.8.15	Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.
ECC.8.16	When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)
ECC.8.17	Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.
ECC.9.1	For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.
ECC.9.2	All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.
ECC.9.3	This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
ECC.9.4	For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
ECC.9.5	For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
ECC.9.6	Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.
ECC.9.7	Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.
ECC.9.8	Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.
ECC.9.9	Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.
ECC.9.10	Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.
ECC.9.11	I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.
ECC.9.12	For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
ECC.9.13	This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:
ECC.9.14	There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:
ECC.9.15	Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
ECC.9.16	Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.
ECC.9.17	The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.
ECC.9.18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.
ECC.10.1	Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.
ECC.10.2	A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.
ECC.10.3	Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.
ECC.10.4	If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.
ECC.10.5	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:
ECC.10.6	Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.
ECC.10.7	I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.
ECC.10.8	He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.
ECC.10.9	Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.
ECC.10.10	If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.
ECC.10.11	Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.
ECC.10.12	The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
ECC.10.13	The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
ECC.10.14	A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?
ECC.10.15	The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.
ECC.10.16	Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!
ECC.10.17	Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
ECC.10.18	By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.
ECC.10.19	A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.
ECC.10.20	Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
ECC.11.1	Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.
ECC.11.2	Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.
ECC.11.3	If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.
ECC.11.4	He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.
ECC.11.5	As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.
ECC.11.6	In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.
ECC.11.7	Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun:
ECC.11.8	But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.
ECC.11.9	Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.
ECC.11.10	Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.
ECC.12.1	Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;
ECC.12.2	While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:
ECC.12.3	In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,
ECC.12.4	And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;
ECC.12.5	Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:
ECC.12.6	Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.
ECC.12.7	Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.
ECC.12.8	Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.
ECC.12.9	And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.
ECC.12.10	The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.
ECC.12.11	The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.
ECC.12.12	And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
ECC.12.13	Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.
ECC.12.14	For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.
SNG.1.1	The song of songs, which is Solomon's.
SNG.1.2	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.
SNG.1.3	Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.
SNG.1.4	Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.
SNG.1.5	I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
SNG.1.6	Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.
SNG.1.7	Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?
SNG.1.8	If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.
SNG.1.9	I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.
SNG.1.10	Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.
SNG.1.11	We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.
SNG.1.12	While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.
SNG.1.13	A bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.
SNG.1.14	My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En–gedi.
SNG.1.15	Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes.
SNG.1.16	Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green.
SNG.1.17	The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.
SNG.2.1	I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.
SNG.2.2	As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
SNG.2.3	As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.
SNG.2.4	He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.
SNG.2.5	Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.
SNG.2.6	His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.
SNG.2.7	I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.
SNG.2.8	The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
SNG.2.9	My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.
SNG.2.10	My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
SNG.2.11	For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;
SNG.2.12	The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;
SNG.2.13	The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
SNG.2.14	O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.
SNG.2.15	Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.
SNG.2.16	My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.
SNG.2.17	Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
SNG.3.1	By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
SNG.3.2	I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
SNG.3.3	The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?
SNG.3.4	It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.
SNG.3.5	I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.
SNG.3.6	Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?
SNG.3.7	Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel.
SNG.3.8	They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.
SNG.3.9	King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.
SNG.3.11	Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
SNG.4.1	Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
SNG.4.2	Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.
SNG.4.3	Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.
SNG.4.4	Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.
SNG.4.5	Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.
SNG.4.6	Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
SNG.4.7	Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.
SNG.4.8	Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
SNG.4.9	Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.
SNG.4.10	How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!
SNG.4.11	Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
SNG.4.13	Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,
SNG.4.14	Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:
SNG.4.15	A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.
SNG.4.16	Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.
SNG.5.1	I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
SNG.5.2	I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.
SNG.5.3	I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
SNG.5.4	My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.
SNG.5.5	I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
SNG.5.6	I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
SNG.5.7	The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
SNG.5.8	I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.
SNG.5.9	What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?
SNG.5.10	My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.
SNG.5.11	His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.
SNG.5.12	His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.
SNG.5.13	His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.
SNG.5.14	His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.
SNG.5.15	His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
SNG.5.16	His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
SNG.6.1	Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.
SNG.6.2	My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.
SNG.6.4	Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.
SNG.6.5	Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.
SNG.6.6	Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.
SNG.6.7	As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.
SNG.6.8	There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.
SNG.6.9	My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
SNG.6.10	Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?
SNG.6.11	I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.
SNG.6.12	Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.
SNG.6.13	Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.
SNG.7.1	How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.
SNG.7.2	Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.
SNG.7.3	Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.
SNG.7.4	Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath–rabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.
SNG.7.6	How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
SNG.7.7	This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.
SNG.7.8	I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;
SNG.7.9	And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
SNG.7.10	I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.
SNG.7.11	Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.
SNG.7.12	Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.
SNG.7.13	The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
SNG.8.1	O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.
SNG.8.2	I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
SNG.8.3	His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
SNG.8.4	I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.
SNG.8.5	Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.
SNG.8.6	Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.
SNG.8.7	Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.
SNG.8.8	We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
SNG.8.9	If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
SNG.8.10	I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.
SNG.8.11	Solomon had a vineyard at Baal–hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.
SNG.8.12	My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
SNG.8.13	Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.
SNG.8.14	Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
ISA.1.1	The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
ISA.1.2	Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the 
ISA.1.3	The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
ISA.1.4	Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the 
ISA.1.5	Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
ISA.1.6	From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
ISA.1.7	Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
ISA.1.8	And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
ISA.1.9	Except the 
ISA.1.10	Hear the word of the 
ISA.1.11	To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the 
ISA.1.12	When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
ISA.1.13	Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
ISA.1.14	Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.
ISA.1.15	And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
ISA.1.16	Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
ISA.1.17	Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
ISA.1.18	Come now, and let us reason together, saith the 
ISA.1.19	If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
ISA.1.20	But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the 
ISA.1.21	How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
ISA.1.22	Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:
ISA.1.23	Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.
ISA.1.24	Therefore saith the Lord, the 
ISA.1.25	And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:
ISA.1.26	And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
ISA.1.27	Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.
ISA.1.28	And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the 
ISA.1.29	For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
ISA.1.30	For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.
ISA.1.31	And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.
ISA.2.1	The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
ISA.2.2	And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the 
ISA.2.3	And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the 
ISA.2.4	And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
ISA.2.5	O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the 
ISA.2.6	Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.
ISA.2.7	Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:
ISA.2.8	Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:
ISA.2.9	And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.
ISA.2.10	Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the 
ISA.2.11	The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the 
ISA.2.12	For the day of the 
ISA.2.13	And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,
ISA.2.14	And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,
ISA.2.15	And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,
ISA.2.16	And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.
ISA.2.17	And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the 
ISA.2.18	And the idols he shall utterly abolish.
ISA.2.19	And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the 
ISA.2.20	In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
ISA.2.21	To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the 
ISA.2.22	Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?
ISA.3.1	For, behold, the Lord, the 
ISA.3.2	The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,
ISA.3.3	The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.
ISA.3.4	And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
ISA.3.5	And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.
ISA.3.6	When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand:
ISA.3.7	In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.
ISA.3.8	For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the 
ISA.3.9	The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.
ISA.3.10	Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
ISA.3.11	Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.
ISA.3.12	As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.
ISA.3.13	The 
ISA.3.14	The 
ISA.3.15	What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord 
ISA.3.16	Moreover the 
ISA.3.17	Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the 
ISA.3.18	In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,
ISA.3.19	The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,
ISA.3.20	The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,
ISA.3.21	The rings, and nose jewels,
ISA.3.22	The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,
ISA.3.23	The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the veils.
ISA.3.24	And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.
ISA.3.25	Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.
ISA.3.26	And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.
ISA.4.1	And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.
ISA.4.2	In that day shall the branch of the 
ISA.4.3	And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:
ISA.4.4	When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.
ISA.4.5	And the 
ISA.4.6	And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.
ISA.5.1	Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:
ISA.5.2	And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
ISA.5.3	And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
ISA.5.4	What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
ISA.5.5	And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:
ISA.5.6	And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
ISA.5.7	For the vineyard of the 
ISA.5.8	Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!
ISA.5.9	In mine ears said the 
ISA.5.10	Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.
ISA.5.11	Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!
ISA.5.12	And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the 
ISA.5.13	Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.
ISA.5.14	Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.
ISA.5.15	And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:
ISA.5.16	But the 
ISA.5.17	Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
ISA.5.18	Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:
ISA.5.19	That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!
ISA.5.20	Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
ISA.5.21	Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
ISA.5.22	Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:
ISA.5.23	Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
ISA.5.24	Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the 
ISA.5.25	Therefore is the anger of the 
ISA.5.26	And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:
ISA.5.27	None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
ISA.5.28	Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:
ISA.5.29	Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.
ISA.5.30	And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.
ISA.6.1	In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.
ISA.6.2	Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.
ISA.6.3	And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the 
ISA.6.4	And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
ISA.6.5	Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the 
ISA.6.6	Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
ISA.6.7	And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
ISA.6.8	Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.
ISA.6.9	And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
ISA.6.10	Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.
ISA.6.11	Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,
ISA.6.12	And the 
ISA.6.13	But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.
ISA.7.1	And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
ISA.7.2	And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
ISA.7.3	Then said the 
ISA.7.4	And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
ISA.7.5	Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,
ISA.7.6	Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:
ISA.7.7	Thus saith the Lord 
ISA.7.8	For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.
ISA.7.9	And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
ISA.7.10	Moreover the 
ISA.7.11	Ask thee a sign of the 
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the 
ISA.7.13	And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?
ISA.7.14	Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
ISA.7.15	Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
ISA.7.16	For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.
ISA.7.17	The 
ISA.7.18	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the 
ISA.7.19	And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.
ISA.7.20	In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.
ISA.7.21	And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;
ISA.7.22	And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.
ISA.7.23	And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.
ISA.7.24	With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.
ISA.7.25	And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.
ISA.8.1	Moreover the 
ISA.8.2	And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.
ISA.8.3	And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the 
ISA.8.4	For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.
ISA.8.5	The 
ISA.8.6	Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;
ISA.8.7	Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:
ISA.8.8	And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
ISA.8.9	Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.
ISA.8.10	Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.
ISA.8.11	For the 
ISA.8.12	Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.
ISA.8.13	Sanctify the 
ISA.8.14	And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
ISA.8.15	And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.
ISA.8.16	Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
ISA.8.17	And I will wait upon the 
ISA.8.18	Behold, I and the children whom the 
ISA.8.19	And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?
ISA.8.20	To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.
ISA.8.21	And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.
ISA.8.22	And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.
ISA.9.1	Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.
ISA.9.2	The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.
ISA.9.3	Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
ISA.9.4	For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.
ISA.9.5	For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.
ISA.9.6	For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
ISA.9.7	Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the 
ISA.9.8	The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.
ISA.9.9	And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,
ISA.9.10	The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.
ISA.9.11	Therefore the 
ISA.9.12	The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.9.13	For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the 
ISA.9.14	Therefore the 
ISA.9.15	The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.
ISA.9.16	For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.
ISA.9.17	Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.9.18	For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.
ISA.9.19	Through the wrath of the 
ISA.9.20	And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:
ISA.9.21	Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.10.1	Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed;
ISA.10.2	To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!
ISA.10.3	And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?
ISA.10.4	Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.10.5	O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.
ISA.10.6	I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
ISA.10.7	Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.
ISA.10.8	For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?
ISA.10.9	Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?
ISA.10.10	As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
ISA.10.11	Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
ISA.10.12	Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.
ISA.10.13	For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man:
ISA.10.14	And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.
ISA.10.15	Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.
ISA.10.16	Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.
ISA.10.17	And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;
ISA.10.18	And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth.
ISA.10.19	And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.
ISA.10.20	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the 
ISA.10.21	The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.
ISA.10.22	For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.
ISA.10.23	For the Lord 
ISA.10.24	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
ISA.10.25	For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.
ISA.10.26	And the 
ISA.10.27	And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.
ISA.10.28	He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:
ISA.10.29	They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.
ISA.10.30	Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.
ISA.10.31	Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.
ISA.10.32	As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
ISA.10.33	Behold, the Lord, the 
ISA.10.34	And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.
ISA.11.1	And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:
ISA.11.2	And the spirit of the 
ISA.11.3	And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the 
ISA.11.4	But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.
ISA.11.5	And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
ISA.11.6	The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.
ISA.11.7	And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
ISA.11.8	And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.
ISA.11.9	They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the 
ISA.11.10	And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.
ISA.11.11	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
ISA.11.12	And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
ISA.11.13	The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.
ISA.11.14	But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.
ISA.11.15	And the 
ISA.11.16	And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
ISA.12.1	And in that day thou shalt say, O 
ISA.12.2	Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the 
ISA.12.3	Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.
ISA.12.4	And in that day shall ye say, Praise the 
ISA.12.5	Sing unto the 
ISA.12.6	Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
ISA.13.1	The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.
ISA.13.2	Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.
ISA.13.3	I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.
ISA.13.4	The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the 
ISA.13.5	They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the 
ISA.13.6	Howl ye; for the day of the 
ISA.13.7	Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:
ISA.13.8	And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.
ISA.13.9	Behold, the day of the 
ISA.13.10	For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
ISA.13.11	And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.
ISA.13.12	I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.
ISA.13.13	Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the 
ISA.13.14	And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.
ISA.13.15	Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.
ISA.13.16	Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.
ISA.13.17	Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.
ISA.13.18	Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.
ISA.13.19	And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
ISA.13.20	It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.
ISA.13.21	But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.
ISA.13.22	And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.
ISA.14.1	For the 
ISA.14.2	And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the 
ISA.14.3	And it shall come to pass in the day that the 
ISA.14.4	That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!
ISA.14.5	The 
ISA.14.6	He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.
ISA.14.7	The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.
ISA.14.8	Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.
ISA.14.9	Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
ISA.14.10	All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?
ISA.14.11	Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.
ISA.14.12	How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
ISA.14.13	For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
ISA.14.14	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.
ISA.14.15	Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
ISA.14.16	They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;
ISA.14.17	That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?
ISA.14.18	All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.
ISA.14.19	But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.
ISA.14.20	Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.
ISA.14.21	Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.
ISA.14.22	For I will rise up against them, saith the 
ISA.14.23	I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the 
ISA.14.24	The 
ISA.14.25	That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.
ISA.14.26	This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.
ISA.14.27	For the 
ISA.14.28	In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.
ISA.14.29	Rejoice not thou, whole Philistia, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.
ISA.14.30	And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.
ISA.14.31	Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Philistia, art dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times.
ISA.14.32	What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the 
ISA.15.1	The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;
ISA.15.2	He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.
ISA.15.3	In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.
ISA.15.4	And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.
ISA.15.5	My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.
ISA.15.6	For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.
ISA.15.7	Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.
ISA.15.8	For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer–elim.
ISA.15.9	For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.
ISA.16.1	Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.
ISA.16.2	For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.
ISA.16.3	Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.
ISA.16.4	Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.
ISA.16.5	And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.
ISA.16.6	We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.
ISA.16.7	Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kir–hareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are stricken.
ISA.16.8	For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.
ISA.16.9	Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.
ISA.16.10	And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.
ISA.16.11	Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir–heres.
ISA.16.12	And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.
ISA.16.13	This is the word that the 
ISA.16.14	But now the 
ISA.17.1	The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.
ISA.17.2	The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
ISA.17.3	The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the 
ISA.17.4	And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.
ISA.17.5	And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.
ISA.17.6	Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the 
ISA.17.7	At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.17.8	And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images.
ISA.17.9	In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel: and there shall be desolation.
ISA.17.10	Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips:
ISA.17.11	In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.
ISA.17.12	Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!
ISA.17.13	The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.
ISA.17.14	And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that rob us.
ISA.18.1	Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia:
ISA.18.2	That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!
ISA.18.3	All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.
ISA.18.4	For so the 
ISA.18.5	For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.
ISA.18.6	They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
ISA.18.7	In that time shall the present be brought unto the 
ISA.19.1	The burden of Egypt. Behold, the 
ISA.19.2	And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.
ISA.19.3	And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.
ISA.19.4	And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the 
ISA.19.5	And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.
ISA.19.6	And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.
ISA.19.7	The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no more.
ISA.19.8	The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.
ISA.19.9	Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.
ISA.19.10	And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices and ponds for fish.
ISA.19.11	Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?
ISA.19.12	Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the 
ISA.19.13	The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Memphis are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.
ISA.19.14	The 
ISA.19.15	Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.
ISA.19.16	In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the 
ISA.19.17	And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the 
ISA.19.18	In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the 
ISA.19.19	In that day shall there be an altar to the 
ISA.19.20	And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the 
ISA.19.21	And the 
ISA.19.22	And the 
ISA.19.23	In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.
ISA.19.24	In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the land:
ISA.19.25	Whom the 
ISA.20.1	In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;
ISA.20.2	At the same time spake the 
ISA.20.3	And the 
ISA.20.4	So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
ISA.20.5	And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.
ISA.20.6	And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?
ISA.21.1	The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.
ISA.21.2	A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.
ISA.21.3	Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.
ISA.21.4	My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.
ISA.21.5	Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.
ISA.21.6	For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.
ISA.21.7	And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:
ISA.21.8	And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:
ISA.21.9	And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.
ISA.21.10	O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the 
ISA.21.11	The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?
ISA.21.12	The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.
ISA.21.13	The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.
ISA.21.14	The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.
ISA.21.15	For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.
ISA.21.16	For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:
ISA.21.17	And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the 
ISA.22.1	The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?
ISA.22.2	Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.
ISA.22.3	All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, which have fled from far.
ISA.22.4	Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.
ISA.22.5	For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord 
ISA.22.6	And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.
ISA.22.7	And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.
ISA.22.8	And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest.
ISA.22.9	Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.
ISA.22.10	And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall.
ISA.22.11	Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.
ISA.22.12	And in that day did the Lord 
ISA.22.13	And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.
ISA.22.14	And it was revealed in mine ears by the 
ISA.22.15	Thus saith the Lord 
ISA.22.16	What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high, and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock?
ISA.22.17	Behold, the 
ISA.22.18	He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house.
ISA.22.19	And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull thee down.
ISA.22.20	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:
ISA.22.21	And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.
ISA.22.22	And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.
ISA.22.23	And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.
ISA.22.24	And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.
ISA.22.25	In that day, saith the 
ISA.23.1	The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.
ISA.23.2	Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.
ISA.23.3	And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.
ISA.23.4	Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.
ISA.23.5	As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.
ISA.23.6	Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.
ISA.23.7	Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.
ISA.23.8	Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth?
ISA.23.9	The 
ISA.23.10	Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is no more strength.
ISA.23.11	He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the 
ISA.23.12	And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Kittim; there also shalt thou have no rest.
ISA.23.13	Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought it to ruin.
ISA.23.14	Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.
ISA.23.15	And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.
ISA.23.16	Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.
ISA.23.17	And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the 
ISA.23.18	And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the 
ISA.24.1	Behold, the 
ISA.24.2	And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.
ISA.24.3	The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the 
ISA.24.4	The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.
ISA.24.5	The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.
ISA.24.6	Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.
ISA.24.7	The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh.
ISA.24.8	The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.
ISA.24.9	They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.
ISA.24.10	The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.
ISA.24.11	There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.
ISA.24.12	In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.
ISA.24.13	When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.
ISA.24.14	They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the 
ISA.24.15	Wherefore glorify ye the 
ISA.24.16	From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.
ISA.24.17	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.
ISA.24.18	And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.
ISA.24.19	The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.
ISA.24.20	The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.
ISA.24.21	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the 
ISA.24.22	And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.
ISA.24.23	Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the 
ISA.25.1	O 
ISA.25.2	For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.
ISA.25.3	Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.
ISA.25.4	For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.
ISA.25.5	Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.
ISA.25.6	And in this mountain shall the 
ISA.25.7	And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations.
ISA.25.8	He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord 
ISA.25.9	And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the 
ISA.25.10	For in this mountain shall the hand of the 
ISA.25.11	And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.
ISA.25.12	And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.
ISA.26.1	In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.
ISA.26.2	Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.
ISA.26.3	Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.
ISA.26.4	Trust ye in the 
ISA.26.5	For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust.
ISA.26.6	The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.
ISA.26.7	The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.
ISA.26.8	Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O 
ISA.26.9	With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.
ISA.26.10	Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the 
ISA.26.13	O 
ISA.26.14	They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.
ISA.26.15	Thou hast increased the nation, O 
ISA.26.17	Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O 
ISA.26.18	We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
ISA.26.19	Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.
ISA.26.20	Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.
ISA.26.21	For, behold, the 
ISA.27.1	In that day the 
ISA.27.2	In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.
ISA.27.3	I the 
ISA.27.4	Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.
ISA.27.5	Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.
ISA.27.6	He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.
ISA.27.7	Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?
ISA.27.8	In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.
ISA.27.9	By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.
ISA.27.10	Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.
ISA.27.11	When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour.
ISA.27.12	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the 
ISA.27.13	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the 
ISA.28.1	Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!
ISA.28.2	Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.
ISA.28.3	The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:
ISA.28.4	And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.
ISA.28.5	In that day shall the 
ISA.28.6	And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.
ISA.28.7	But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.
ISA.28.8	For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.
ISA.28.9	Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.
ISA.28.10	For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:
ISA.28.11	For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.
ISA.28.12	To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.
ISA.28.13	But the word of the 
ISA.28.14	Wherefore hear the word of the 
ISA.28.15	Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:
ISA.28.16	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
ISA.28.17	Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.
ISA.28.18	And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.
ISA.28.19	From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.
ISA.28.20	For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.
ISA.28.21	For the 
ISA.28.22	Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord 
ISA.28.23	Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.
ISA.28.24	Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?
ISA.28.25	When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place?
ISA.28.26	For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.
ISA.28.27	For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.
ISA.28.28	Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.
ISA.28.29	This also cometh forth from the 
ISA.29.1	Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices.
ISA.29.2	Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.
ISA.29.3	And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.
ISA.29.4	And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.
ISA.29.5	Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.
ISA.29.6	Thou shalt be visited of the 
ISA.29.7	And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.
ISA.29.8	It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.
ISA.29.9	Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
ISA.29.10	For the 
ISA.29.11	And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:
ISA.29.12	And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.
ISA.29.13	Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:
ISA.29.14	Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.
ISA.29.15	Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the 
ISA.29.16	Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?
ISA.29.17	Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
ISA.29.18	And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.
ISA.29.19	The meek also shall increase their joy in the 
ISA.29.20	For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:
ISA.29.21	That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.
ISA.29.22	Therefore thus saith the 
ISA.29.23	But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.
ISA.29.24	They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.
ISA.30.1	Woe to the rebellious children, saith the 
ISA.30.2	That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!
ISA.30.3	Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.
ISA.30.4	For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.
ISA.30.5	They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.
ISA.30.6	The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.
ISA.30.7	For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.
ISA.30.8	Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:
ISA.30.9	That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the 
ISA.30.10	Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:
ISA.30.11	Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
ISA.30.12	Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:
ISA.30.13	Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.
ISA.30.14	And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.
ISA.30.15	For thus saith the Lord 
ISA.30.16	But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
ISA.30.17	One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.
ISA.30.18	And therefore will the 
ISA.30.19	For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.
ISA.30.20	And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:
ISA.30.21	And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
ISA.30.22	Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.
ISA.30.23	Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.
ISA.30.24	The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.
ISA.30.25	And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
ISA.30.26	Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the 
ISA.30.27	Behold, the name of the 
ISA.30.28	And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.
ISA.30.29	Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the 
ISA.30.30	And the 
ISA.30.31	For through the voice of the 
ISA.30.32	And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the 
ISA.30.33	For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the 
ISA.31.1	Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the 
ISA.31.2	Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.
ISA.31.3	Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the 
ISA.31.4	For thus hath the 
ISA.31.5	As birds flying, so will the 
ISA.31.6	Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.
ISA.31.7	For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.
ISA.31.8	Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.
ISA.31.9	And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the 
ISA.32.1	Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.
ISA.32.2	And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.
ISA.32.3	And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.
ISA.32.4	The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
ISA.32.5	The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful.
ISA.32.6	For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the 
ISA.32.7	The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.
ISA.32.8	But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.
ISA.32.9	Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech.
ISA.32.10	Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.
ISA.32.11	Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins.
ISA.32.12	They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
ISA.32.13	Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:
ISA.32.14	Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
ISA.32.15	Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.
ISA.32.16	Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.
ISA.32.17	And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.
ISA.32.18	And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;
ISA.32.19	When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.
ISA.32.20	Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass.
ISA.33.1	Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.
ISA.33.2	O 
ISA.33.3	At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.
ISA.33.4	And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.
ISA.33.5	The 
ISA.33.6	And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the 
ISA.33.7	Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.
ISA.33.8	The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.
ISA.33.9	The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.
ISA.33.10	Now will I rise, saith the 
ISA.33.11	Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.
ISA.33.12	And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.
ISA.33.13	Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.
ISA.33.14	The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?
ISA.33.15	He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;
ISA.33.16	He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.
ISA.33.17	Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.
ISA.33.18	Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?
ISA.33.19	Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand.
ISA.33.20	Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.
ISA.33.21	But there the glorious 
ISA.33.22	For the 
ISA.33.23	Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.
ISA.33.24	And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.
ISA.34.1	Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it.
ISA.34.2	For the indignation of the 
ISA.34.3	Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
ISA.34.4	And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.
ISA.34.5	For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.
ISA.34.6	The sword of the 
ISA.34.7	And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
ISA.34.8	For it is the day of the 
ISA.34.9	And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
ISA.34.10	It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
ISA.34.11	But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.
ISA.34.12	They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.
ISA.34.13	And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls.
ISA.34.14	The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.
ISA.34.15	There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.
ISA.34.16	Seek ye out of the book of the 
ISA.34.17	And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
ISA.35.1	The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.
ISA.35.2	It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the 
ISA.35.3	Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
ISA.35.4	Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.
ISA.35.5	Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
ISA.35.6	Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.
ISA.35.7	And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.
ISA.35.8	And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.
ISA.35.9	No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:
ISA.35.10	And the ransomed of the 
ISA.36.1	Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.
ISA.36.2	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.
ISA.36.3	Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.
ISA.36.4	And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
ISA.36.5	I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
ISA.36.6	Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.
ISA.36.7	But if thou say to me, We trust in the 
ISA.36.8	Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
ISA.36.9	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
ISA.36.10	And am I now come up without the 
ISA.36.11	Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
ISA.36.12	But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?
ISA.36.13	Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
ISA.36.14	Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.
ISA.36.15	Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the 
ISA.36.16	Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
ISA.36.17	Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
ISA.36.18	Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The 
ISA.36.19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
ISA.36.20	Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the 
ISA.36.21	But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
ISA.36.22	Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
ISA.37.1	And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the 
ISA.37.2	And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
ISA.37.3	And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
ISA.37.4	It may be the 
ISA.37.5	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
ISA.37.6	And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the 
ISA.37.7	Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
ISA.37.8	So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
ISA.37.9	And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
ISA.37.10	Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
ISA.37.11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
ISA.37.12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?
ISA.37.13	Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
ISA.37.14	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the 
ISA.37.15	And Hezekiah prayed unto the 
ISA.37.16	O 
ISA.37.17	Incline thine ear, O 
ISA.37.18	Of a truth, 
ISA.37.19	And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
ISA.37.20	Now therefore, O 
ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the 
ISA.37.22	This is the word which the 
ISA.37.23	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.37.24	By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.
ISA.37.25	I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
ISA.37.26	Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.
ISA.37.27	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.
ISA.37.28	But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
ISA.37.29	Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
ISA.37.30	And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
ISA.37.31	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:
ISA.37.32	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the 
ISA.37.33	Therefore thus saith the 
ISA.37.34	By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the 
ISA.37.35	For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
ISA.37.36	Then the angel of the 
ISA.37.37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
ISA.37.38	And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esar–haddon his son reigned in his stead.
ISA.38.1	In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
ISA.38.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the 
ISA.38.3	And said, Remember now, O 
ISA.38.4	Then came the word of the 
ISA.38.5	Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the 
ISA.38.6	And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.
ISA.38.7	And this shall be a sign unto thee from the 
ISA.38.8	Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.
ISA.38.9	The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:
ISA.38.10	I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.
ISA.38.11	I said, I shall not see the 
ISA.38.12	Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.
ISA.38.13	I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.
ISA.38.14	Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O 
ISA.38.15	What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
ISA.38.16	O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.
ISA.38.17	Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
ISA.38.18	For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
ISA.38.19	The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.
ISA.38.20	The 
ISA.38.21	For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.
ISA.38.22	Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the 
ISA.39.1	At that time Merodach–baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.
ISA.39.2	And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.
ISA.39.3	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.
ISA.39.4	Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.
ISA.39.5	Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the 
ISA.39.6	Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the 
ISA.39.7	And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
ISA.39.8	Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the 
ISA.40.1	Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
ISA.40.2	Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the 
ISA.40.3	The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the 
ISA.40.4	Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:
ISA.40.5	And the glory of the 
ISA.40.6	The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:
ISA.40.7	The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the 
ISA.40.8	The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.
ISA.40.9	O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!
ISA.40.10	Behold, the Lord 
ISA.40.11	He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.
ISA.40.12	Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
ISA.40.13	Who hath directed the Spirit of the 
ISA.40.14	With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?
ISA.40.15	Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.
ISA.40.16	And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.
ISA.40.17	All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.
ISA.40.18	To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?
ISA.40.19	The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.
ISA.40.20	He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.
ISA.40.21	Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?
ISA.40.22	It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:
ISA.40.23	That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.
ISA.40.24	Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.
ISA.40.25	To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.
ISA.40.26	Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.
ISA.40.27	Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the 
ISA.40.28	Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the 
ISA.40.29	He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.
ISA.40.30	Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:
ISA.40.31	But they that wait upon the 
ISA.41.1	Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment.
ISA.41.2	Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.
ISA.41.3	He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet.
ISA.41.4	Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the 
ISA.41.5	The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.
ISA.41.6	They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his brother, Be of good courage.
ISA.41.7	So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.
ISA.41.8	But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.
ISA.41.9	Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.
ISA.41.10	Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.
ISA.41.11	Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish.
ISA.41.12	Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.
ISA.41.13	For I the 
ISA.41.14	Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the 
ISA.41.15	Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.
ISA.41.16	Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the 
ISA.41.17	When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the 
ISA.41.18	I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
ISA.41.19	I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:
ISA.41.20	That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the 
ISA.41.21	Produce your cause, saith the 
ISA.41.22	Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.
ISA.41.23	Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.
ISA.41.24	Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination is he that chooseth you.
ISA.41.25	I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as upon mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay.
ISA.41.26	Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that heareth your words.
ISA.41.27	The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.
ISA.41.28	For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.
ISA.41.29	Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.
ISA.42.1	Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.
ISA.42.2	He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.
ISA.42.3	A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.
ISA.42.4	He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.
ISA.42.5	Thus saith God the 
ISA.42.6	I the 
ISA.42.7	To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.
ISA.42.8	I am the 
ISA.42.9	Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.
ISA.42.10	Sing unto the 
ISA.42.11	Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.
ISA.42.12	Let them give glory unto the 
ISA.42.13	The 
ISA.42.14	I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.
ISA.42.15	I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.
ISA.42.16	And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.
ISA.42.17	They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.
ISA.42.18	Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.
ISA.42.19	Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the 
ISA.42.20	Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.
ISA.42.21	The 
ISA.42.22	But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.
ISA.42.23	Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?
ISA.42.24	Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the 
ISA.42.25	Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.
ISA.43.1	But now thus saith the 
ISA.43.2	When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
ISA.43.3	For I am the 
ISA.43.4	Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.
ISA.43.5	Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;
ISA.43.6	I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;
ISA.43.7	Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.
ISA.43.8	Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.
ISA.43.9	Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.
ISA.43.10	Ye are my witnesses, saith the 
ISA.43.11	I, even I, am the 
ISA.43.12	I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the 
ISA.43.13	Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?
ISA.43.14	Thus saith the 
ISA.43.15	I am the 
ISA.43.16	Thus saith the 
ISA.43.17	Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.
ISA.43.18	Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
ISA.43.19	Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.
ISA.43.20	The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.
ISA.43.21	This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.
ISA.43.22	But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.
ISA.43.23	Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.
ISA.43.24	Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.
ISA.43.25	I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.
ISA.43.26	Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.
ISA.43.27	Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.
ISA.43.28	Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.
ISA.44.1	Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:
ISA.44.2	Thus saith the 
ISA.44.3	For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:
ISA.44.4	And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.
ISA.44.5	One shall say, I am the 
ISA.44.6	Thus saith the 
ISA.44.7	And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.
ISA.44.8	Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.
ISA.44.9	They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.
ISA.44.10	Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?
ISA.44.11	Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together.
ISA.44.12	The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.
ISA.44.13	The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.
ISA.44.14	He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.
ISA.44.15	Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.
ISA.44.16	He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:
ISA.44.17	And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.
ISA.44.18	They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.
ISA.44.19	And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?
ISA.44.20	He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?
ISA.44.21	Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.
ISA.44.22	I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.
ISA.44.23	Sing, O ye heavens; for the 
ISA.44.24	Thus saith the 
ISA.44.25	That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;
ISA.44.26	That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:
ISA.44.27	That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:
ISA.44.28	That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.
ISA.45.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.45.2	I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:
ISA.45.3	And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the 
ISA.45.4	For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.
ISA.45.5	I am the 
ISA.45.6	That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the 
ISA.45.7	I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the 
ISA.45.8	Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the 
ISA.45.9	Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?
ISA.45.10	Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?
ISA.45.11	Thus saith the 
ISA.45.12	I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.
ISA.45.13	I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the 
ISA.45.14	Thus saith the 
ISA.45.15	Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.
ISA.45.16	They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.
ISA.45.17	But Israel shall be saved in the 
ISA.45.18	For thus saith the 
ISA.45.19	I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the 
ISA.45.20	Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.
ISA.45.21	Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the 
ISA.45.22	Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.
ISA.45.23	I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.
ISA.45.24	Surely, shall one say, in the 
ISA.45.25	In the 
ISA.46.1	Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden; they are a burden to the weary beast.
ISA.46.2	They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.
ISA.46.3	Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb:
ISA.46.4	And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.
ISA.46.5	To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?
ISA.46.6	They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship.
ISA.46.7	They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.
ISA.46.8	Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.
ISA.46.9	Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me,
ISA.46.10	Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:
ISA.46.11	Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.
ISA.46.12	Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousness:
ISA.46.13	I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.
ISA.47.1	Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.
ISA.47.2	Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.
ISA.47.3	Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man.
ISA.47.4	As for our redeemer, the 
ISA.47.5	Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.
ISA.47.6	I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.
ISA.47.7	And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.
ISA.47.8	Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:
ISA.47.9	But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.
ISA.47.10	For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.
ISA.47.11	Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.
ISA.47.12	Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.
ISA.47.13	Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.
ISA.47.14	Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.
ISA.47.15	Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.
ISA.48.1	Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the 
ISA.48.2	For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The 
ISA.48.3	I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.
ISA.48.4	Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;
ISA.48.5	I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.
ISA.48.6	Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.
ISA.48.7	They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.
ISA.48.8	Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.
ISA.48.9	For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.
ISA.48.10	Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.
ISA.48.11	For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.
ISA.48.12	Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.
ISA.48.13	Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.
ISA.48.14	All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The 
ISA.48.15	I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
ISA.48.16	Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord 
ISA.48.17	Thus saith the 
ISA.48.18	O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:
ISA.48.19	Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.
ISA.48.20	Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The 
ISA.48.21	And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.
ISA.48.22	There is no peace, saith the 
ISA.49.1	Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The 
ISA.49.2	And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;
ISA.49.3	And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.
ISA.49.4	Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the 
ISA.49.5	And now, saith the 
ISA.49.6	And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.
ISA.49.7	Thus saith the 
ISA.49.8	Thus saith the 
ISA.49.9	That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.
ISA.49.10	They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.
ISA.49.11	And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.
ISA.49.12	Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.
ISA.49.13	Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the 
ISA.49.14	But Zion said, The 
ISA.49.15	Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.
ISA.49.16	Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.
ISA.49.17	Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.
ISA.49.18	Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the 
ISA.49.19	For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.
ISA.49.20	The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.
ISA.49.21	Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?
ISA.49.22	Thus saith the Lord 
ISA.49.23	And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the 
ISA.49.24	Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?
ISA.49.25	But thus saith the 
ISA.49.26	And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the 
ISA.50.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.50.2	Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.
ISA.50.3	I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.
ISA.50.4	The Lord 
ISA.50.5	The Lord 
ISA.50.6	I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
ISA.50.7	For the Lord 
ISA.50.8	He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.
ISA.50.9	Behold, the Lord 
ISA.50.10	Who is among you that feareth the 
ISA.50.11	Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.
ISA.51.1	Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the 
ISA.51.2	Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.
ISA.51.3	For the 
ISA.51.4	Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.
ISA.51.5	My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.
ISA.51.6	Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
ISA.51.7	Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.
ISA.51.8	For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.
ISA.51.9	Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the 
ISA.51.10	Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?
ISA.51.11	Therefore the redeemed of the 
ISA.51.12	I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;
ISA.51.13	And forgettest the 
ISA.51.14	The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.
ISA.51.15	But I am the 
ISA.51.16	And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.
ISA.51.17	Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the 
ISA.51.18	There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.
ISA.51.19	These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?
ISA.51.20	Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the 
ISA.51.21	Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:
ISA.51.22	Thus saith thy Lord the 
ISA.51.23	But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.
ISA.52.1	Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.
ISA.52.2	Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
ISA.52.3	For thus saith the 
ISA.52.4	For thus saith the Lord 
ISA.52.5	Now therefore, what have I here, saith the 
ISA.52.6	Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.
ISA.52.7	How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!
ISA.52.8	Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the 
ISA.52.9	Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the 
ISA.52.10	The 
ISA.52.11	Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the 
ISA.52.12	For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the 
ISA.52.13	Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.
ISA.52.14	As many were astonished at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:
ISA.52.15	So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.
ISA.53.1	Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the 
ISA.53.2	For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
ISA.53.3	He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
ISA.53.4	Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
ISA.53.5	But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
ISA.53.6	All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the 
ISA.53.7	He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.
ISA.53.8	He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.
ISA.53.9	And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.
ISA.53.10	Yet it pleased the 
ISA.53.11	He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
ISA.53.12	Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
ISA.54.1	Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the 
ISA.54.2	Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;
ISA.54.3	For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
ISA.54.4	Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.
ISA.54.5	For thy Maker is thine husband; the 
ISA.54.6	For the 
ISA.54.7	For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.
ISA.54.8	In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the 
ISA.54.9	For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.
ISA.54.10	For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the 
ISA.54.11	O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.
ISA.54.12	And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.
ISA.54.13	And all thy children shall be taught of the 
ISA.54.14	In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.
ISA.54.15	Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.
ISA.54.16	Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.
ISA.54.17	No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the 
ISA.55.1	Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
ISA.55.2	Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
ISA.55.3	Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.
ISA.55.4	Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.
ISA.55.5	Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the 
ISA.55.6	Seek ye the 
ISA.55.7	Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the 
ISA.55.8	For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the 
ISA.55.9	For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
ISA.55.10	For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:
ISA.55.11	So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
ISA.55.12	For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
ISA.55.13	Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the 
ISA.56.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.56.2	Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.
ISA.56.3	Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the 
ISA.56.4	For thus saith the 
ISA.56.5	Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
ISA.56.6	Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the 
ISA.56.7	Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.
ISA.56.8	The Lord 
ISA.56.9	All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the forest.
ISA.56.10	His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.
ISA.56.11	Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.
ISA.56.12	Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.
ISA.57.1	The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.
ISA.57.2	He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.
ISA.57.3	But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.
ISA.57.4	Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,
ISA.57.5	Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?
ISA.57.6	Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?
ISA.57.7	Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.
ISA.57.8	Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.
ISA.57.9	And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even unto hell.
ISA.57.10	Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.
ISA.57.11	And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?
ISA.57.12	I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.
ISA.57.13	When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;
ISA.57.14	And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.
ISA.57.15	For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
ISA.57.16	For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.
ISA.57.17	For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.
ISA.57.18	I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.
ISA.57.19	I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the 
ISA.57.20	But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.
ISA.57.21	There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
ISA.58.1	Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.
ISA.58.2	Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.
ISA.58.3	Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.
ISA.58.4	Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.
ISA.58.5	Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the 
ISA.58.6	Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?
ISA.58.7	Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?
ISA.58.8	Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the 
ISA.58.9	Then shalt thou call, and the 
ISA.58.10	And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday:
ISA.58.11	And the 
ISA.58.12	And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.
ISA.58.13	If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the 
ISA.58.14	Then shalt thou delight thyself in the 
ISA.59.1	Behold, the 
ISA.59.2	But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.
ISA.59.3	For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.
ISA.59.4	None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
ISA.59.5	They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.
ISA.59.6	Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.
ISA.59.7	Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.
ISA.59.8	The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.
ISA.59.9	Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.
ISA.59.10	We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.
ISA.59.11	We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.
ISA.59.12	For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;
ISA.59.13	In transgressing and lying against the 
ISA.59.14	And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.
ISA.59.15	Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the 
ISA.59.16	And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.
ISA.59.17	For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.
ISA.59.18	According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.
ISA.59.19	So shall they fear the name of the 
ISA.59.20	And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the 
ISA.59.21	As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the 
ISA.60.1	Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the 
ISA.60.2	For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the 
ISA.60.3	And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.
ISA.60.4	Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.
ISA.60.5	Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee.
ISA.60.6	The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall shew forth the praises of the 
ISA.60.7	All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.
ISA.60.8	Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?
ISA.60.9	Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the 
ISA.60.10	And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.
ISA.60.11	Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.
ISA.60.12	For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
ISA.60.13	The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
ISA.60.14	The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the 
ISA.60.15	Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.
ISA.60.16	Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the 
ISA.60.17	For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness.
ISA.60.18	Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.
ISA.60.19	The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the 
ISA.60.20	Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the 
ISA.60.21	Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.
ISA.60.22	A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the 
ISA.61.1	The Spirit of the Lord 
ISA.61.2	To proclaim the acceptable year of the 
ISA.61.3	To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the 
ISA.61.4	And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
ISA.61.5	And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
ISA.61.6	But ye shall be named the Priests of the 
ISA.61.7	For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.
ISA.61.8	For I the 
ISA.61.9	And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the 
ISA.61.10	I will greatly rejoice in the 
ISA.61.11	For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord 
ISA.62.1	For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.
ISA.62.2	And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the 
ISA.62.3	Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the 
ISA.62.4	Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi–bah, and thy land Beulah: for the 
ISA.62.5	For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.
ISA.62.6	I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the 
ISA.62.7	And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
ISA.62.8	The 
ISA.62.9	But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the 
ISA.62.10	Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.
ISA.62.11	Behold, the 
ISA.62.12	And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the 
ISA.63.1	Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.
ISA.63.2	Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?
ISA.63.3	I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.
ISA.63.4	For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.
ISA.63.5	And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.
ISA.63.6	And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.
ISA.63.7	I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the 
ISA.63.8	For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour.
ISA.63.9	In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.
ISA.63.10	But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.
ISA.63.11	Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?
ISA.63.12	That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?
ISA.63.13	That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble?
ISA.63.14	As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the 
ISA.63.15	Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?
ISA.63.16	Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O 
ISA.63.17	O 
ISA.63.18	The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.
ISA.63.19	We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.
ISA.64.1	Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,
ISA.64.2	As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!
ISA.64.3	When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.
ISA.64.4	For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.
ISA.64.5	Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.
ISA.64.6	But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
ISA.64.7	And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.
ISA.64.8	But now, O 
ISA.64.9	Be not wroth very sore, O 
ISA.64.10	Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
ISA.64.11	Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.
ISA.64.12	Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O 
ISA.65.1	I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.
ISA.65.2	I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;
ISA.65.3	A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;
ISA.65.4	Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;
ISA.65.5	Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.
ISA.65.6	Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,
ISA.65.7	Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the 
ISA.65.8	Thus saith the 
ISA.65.9	And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
ISA.65.10	And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
ISA.65.11	But ye are they that forsake the 
ISA.65.12	Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.
ISA.65.13	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
ISA.65.14	Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.
ISA.65.15	And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord 
ISA.65.16	That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
ISA.65.17	For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
ISA.65.18	But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
ISA.65.19	And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
ISA.65.20	There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.
ISA.65.21	And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
ISA.65.22	They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
ISA.65.23	They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the 
ISA.65.24	And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
ISA.65.25	The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the 
ISA.66.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.66.2	For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the 
ISA.66.3	He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.
ISA.66.4	I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.
ISA.66.5	Hear the word of the 
ISA.66.6	A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the 
ISA.66.7	Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.
ISA.66.8	Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
ISA.66.9	Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the 
ISA.66.10	Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:
ISA.66.11	That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
ISA.66.12	For thus saith the 
ISA.66.13	As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
ISA.66.14	And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the 
ISA.66.15	For, behold, the 
ISA.66.16	For by fire and by his sword will the 
ISA.66.17	They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the 
ISA.66.18	For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
ISA.66.19	And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
ISA.66.20	And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the 
ISA.66.21	And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the 
ISA.66.22	For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the 
ISA.66.23	And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the 
ISA.66.24	And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.
JER.1.1	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
JER.1.2	To whom the word of the 
JER.1.3	It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
JER.1.4	Then the word of the 
JER.1.5	Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.
JER.1.6	Then said I, Ah, Lord 
JER.1.7	But the 
JER.1.8	Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the 
JER.1.9	Then the 
JER.1.10	See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.
JER.1.11	Moreover the word of the 
JER.1.12	Then said the 
JER.1.13	And the word of the 
JER.1.14	Then the 
JER.1.15	For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the 
JER.1.16	And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.
JER.1.17	Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.
JER.1.18	For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
JER.1.19	And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the 
JER.2.1	Moreover the word of the 
JER.2.2	Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.2.3	Israel was holiness unto the 
JER.2.4	Hear ye the word of the 
JER.2.5	Thus saith the 
JER.2.6	Neither said they, Where is the 
JER.2.7	And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.
JER.2.8	The priests said not, Where is the 
JER.2.9	Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the 
JER.2.10	For pass over the isles of Kittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.
JER.2.11	Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.
JER.2.12	Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the 
JER.2.13	For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
JER.2.14	Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?
JER.2.15	The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.
JER.2.16	Also the children of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of thy head.
JER.2.17	Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the 
JER.2.18	And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?
JER.2.19	Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the 
JER.2.20	For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.
JER.2.21	Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?
JER.2.22	For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord 
JER.2.23	How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
JER.2.24	A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.
JER.2.25	Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.
JER.2.26	As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,
JER.2.27	Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.
JER.2.28	But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.
JER.2.29	Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the 
JER.2.30	In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
JER.2.31	O generation, see ye the word of the 
JER.2.32	Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
JER.2.33	Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.
JER.2.34	Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.
JER.2.35	Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.
JER.2.36	Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.
JER.2.37	Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the 
JER.3.1	They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the 
JER.3.2	Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.
JER.3.3	Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.
JER.3.4	Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth?
JER.3.5	Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.
JER.3.6	The 
JER.3.7	And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
JER.3.8	And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.
JER.3.9	And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
JER.3.10	And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the 
JER.3.11	And the 
JER.3.12	Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the 
JER.3.13	Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the 
JER.3.14	Turn, O backsliding children, saith the 
JER.3.15	And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
JER.3.16	And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the 
JER.3.17	At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the 
JER.3.18	In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.
JER.3.19	But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.
JER.3.20	Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the 
JER.3.21	A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the 
JER.3.22	Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the 
JER.3.23	Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the 
JER.3.24	For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
JER.3.25	We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned against the 
JER.4.1	If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the 
JER.4.2	And thou shalt swear, The 
JER.4.3	For thus saith the 
JER.4.4	Circumcise yourselves to the 
JER.4.5	Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.
JER.4.6	Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
JER.4.7	The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.
JER.4.8	For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the 
JER.4.9	And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the 
JER.4.10	Then said I, Ah, Lord 
JER.4.11	At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,
JER.4.12	Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.
JER.4.13	Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.
JER.4.14	O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?
JER.4.15	For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.
JER.4.16	Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.
JER.4.17	As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the 
JER.4.18	Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart.
JER.4.19	My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
JER.4.20	Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.
JER.4.21	How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?
JER.4.22	For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
JER.4.23	I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.
JER.4.24	I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.
JER.4.25	I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.
JER.4.26	I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the 
JER.4.27	For thus hath the 
JER.4.28	For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.
JER.4.29	The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.
JER.4.30	And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.
JER.4.31	For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.
JER.5.1	Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.
JER.5.2	And though they say, The 
JER.5.3	O 
JER.5.4	Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the 
JER.5.5	I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the 
JER.5.6	Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.
JER.5.7	How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.
JER.5.8	They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.
JER.5.9	Shall I not visit for these things? saith the 
JER.5.10	Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they are not the 
JER.5.11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the 
JER.5.12	They have belied the 
JER.5.13	And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.
JER.5.14	Wherefore thus saith the 
JER.5.15	Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the 
JER.5.16	Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.
JER.5.17	And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.
JER.5.18	Nevertheless in those days, saith the 
JER.5.19	And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the 
JER.5.20	Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
JER.5.21	Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:
JER.5.22	Fear ye not me? saith the 
JER.5.23	But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.
JER.5.24	Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the 
JER.5.25	Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good things from you.
JER.5.26	For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.
JER.5.27	As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.
JER.5.28	They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
JER.5.29	Shall I not visit for these things? saith the 
JER.5.30	A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;
JER.5.31	The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?
JER.6.1	O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Beth–haccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.
JER.6.2	I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.
JER.6.3	The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.
JER.6.4	Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.
JER.6.5	Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
JER.6.6	For thus hath the 
JER.6.7	As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.
JER.6.8	Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.
JER.6.9	Thus saith the 
JER.6.10	To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the 
JER.6.11	Therefore I am full of the fury of the 
JER.6.12	And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the 
JER.6.13	For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.
JER.6.14	They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
JER.6.15	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the 
JER.6.16	Thus saith the 
JER.6.17	Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.
JER.6.18	Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.
JER.6.19	Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.
JER.6.20	To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.
JER.6.21	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.6.22	Thus saith the 
JER.6.23	They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.
JER.6.24	We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.
JER.6.25	Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side.
JER.6.26	O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.
JER.6.27	I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.
JER.6.28	They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.
JER.6.29	The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.
JER.6.30	Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the 
JER.7.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.7.2	Stand in the gate of the 
JER.7.3	Thus saith the 
JER.7.4	Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the 
JER.7.5	For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;
JER.7.6	If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:
JER.7.7	Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.
JER.7.8	Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
JER.7.9	Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;
JER.7.10	And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?
JER.7.11	Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the 
JER.7.12	But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
JER.7.13	And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the 
JER.7.14	Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.
JER.7.15	And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
JER.7.16	Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.
JER.7.17	Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
JER.7.18	The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.
JER.7.19	Do they provoke me to anger? saith the 
JER.7.20	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
JER.7.21	Thus saith the 
JER.7.22	For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:
JER.7.23	But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.
JER.7.24	But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.
JER.7.25	Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:
JER.7.26	Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.
JER.7.27	Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.
JER.7.28	But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the 
JER.7.29	Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the 
JER.7.30	For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the 
JER.7.31	And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.
JER.7.32	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.7.33	And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.
JER.7.34	Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.
JER.8.1	At that time, saith the 
JER.8.2	And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.
JER.8.3	And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the 
JER.8.4	Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.8.5	Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.
JER.8.6	I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.
JER.8.7	Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the 
JER.8.8	How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the 
JER.8.9	The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the 
JER.8.10	Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.
JER.8.11	For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
JER.8.12	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the 
JER.8.13	I will surely consume them, saith the 
JER.8.14	Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the 
JER.8.15	We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble!
JER.8.16	The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.
JER.8.17	For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the 
JER.8.18	When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me.
JER.8.19	Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the 
JER.8.20	The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
JER.8.21	For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.
JER.8.22	Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?
JER.9.1	Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
JER.9.2	Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
JER.9.3	And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the 
JER.9.4	Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.
JER.9.5	And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity.
JER.9.6	Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the 
JER.9.7	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.9.8	Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.
JER.9.9	Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the 
JER.9.10	For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.
JER.9.11	And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.
JER.9.12	Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the 
JER.9.13	And the 
JER.9.14	But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:
JER.9.15	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.9.16	I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.
JER.9.17	Thus saith the 
JER.9.18	And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.
JER.9.19	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out.
JER.9.20	Yet hear the word of the 
JER.9.21	For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets.
JER.9.22	Speak, Thus saith the 
JER.9.23	Thus saith the 
JER.9.24	But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the 
JER.9.25	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.9.26	Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.
JER.10.1	Hear ye the word which the 
JER.10.2	Thus saith the 
JER.10.3	For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.
JER.10.4	They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
JER.10.5	They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.
JER.10.6	Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O 
JER.10.7	Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.
JER.10.8	But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.
JER.10.9	Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.
JER.10.10	But the 
JER.10.11	Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.
JER.10.12	He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.
JER.10.13	When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
JER.10.14	Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
JER.10.15	They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
JER.10.16	The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The 
JER.10.17	Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.
JER.10.18	For thus saith the 
JER.10.19	Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.
JER.10.20	My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
JER.10.21	For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the 
JER.10.22	Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.
JER.10.23	O 
JER.10.24	O 
JER.10.25	Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.
JER.11.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.11.2	Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
JER.11.3	And say thou unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.11.4	Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:
JER.11.5	That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O 
JER.11.6	Then the 
JER.11.7	For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.
JER.11.8	Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did them not.
JER.11.9	And the 
JER.11.10	They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
JER.11.11	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.11.12	Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
JER.11.13	For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.
JER.11.14	Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.
JER.11.15	What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.
JER.11.16	The 
JER.11.17	For the 
JER.11.18	And the 
JER.11.19	But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.
JER.11.20	But, O 
JER.11.21	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.11.22	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.11.23	And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.
JER.12.1	Righteous art thou, O 
JER.12.2	Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.
JER.12.3	But thou, O 
JER.12.4	How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.
JER.12.5	If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?
JER.12.6	For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.
JER.12.7	I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
JER.12.8	Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.
JER.12.9	Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.
JER.12.10	Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
JER.12.11	They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.
JER.12.12	The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the 
JER.12.13	They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the 
JER.12.14	Thus saith the 
JER.12.15	And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
JER.12.16	And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The 
JER.12.17	But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the 
JER.13.1	Thus saith the 
JER.13.2	So I got a girdle according to the word of the 
JER.13.3	And the word of the 
JER.13.4	Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.
JER.13.5	So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the 
JER.13.6	And it came to pass after many days, that the 
JER.13.7	Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
JER.13.8	Then the word of the 
JER.13.9	Thus saith the 
JER.13.10	This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.
JER.13.11	For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the 
JER.13.12	Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the 
JER.13.13	Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.13.14	And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the 
JER.13.15	Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the 
JER.13.16	Give glory to the 
JER.13.17	But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the 
JER.13.18	Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory.
JER.13.19	The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.
JER.13.20	Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?
JER.13.21	What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?
JER.13.22	And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare.
JER.13.23	Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.
JER.13.24	Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness.
JER.13.25	This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the 
JER.13.26	Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.
JER.13.27	I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be?
JER.14.1	The word of the 
JER.14.2	Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
JER.14.3	And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.
JER.14.4	Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.
JER.14.5	Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass.
JER.14.6	And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass.
JER.14.7	O 
JER.14.8	O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?
JER.14.9	Why shouldest thou be as a man astonished, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O 
JER.14.10	Thus saith the 
JER.14.11	Then said the 
JER.14.12	When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
JER.14.13	Then said I, Ah, Lord 
JER.14.14	Then the 
JER.14.15	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.14.16	And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
JER.14.17	Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.
JER.14.18	If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.
JER.14.19	Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!
JER.14.20	We acknowledge, O 
JER.14.21	Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.
JER.14.22	Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O 
JER.15.1	Then said the 
JER.15.2	And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the 
JER.15.3	And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the 
JER.15.4	And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
JER.15.5	For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?
JER.15.6	Thou hast forsaken me, saith the 
JER.15.7	And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people, since they return not from their ways.
JER.15.8	Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.
JER.15.9	She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the 
JER.15.10	Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me.
JER.15.11	The 
JER.15.12	Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?
JER.15.13	Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
JER.15.14	And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.
JER.15.15	O 
JER.15.16	Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O 
JER.15.17	I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.
JER.15.18	Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?
JER.15.19	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.15.20	And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the 
JER.15.21	And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.
JER.16.1	The word of the 
JER.16.2	Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place.
JER.16.3	For thus saith the 
JER.16.4	They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
JER.16.5	For thus saith the 
JER.16.6	Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:
JER.16.7	Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
JER.16.8	Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.
JER.16.9	For thus saith the 
JER.16.10	And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the 
JER.16.11	Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the 
JER.16.12	And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:
JER.16.13	Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you favour.
JER.16.14	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.16.15	But, The 
JER.16.16	Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the 
JER.16.17	For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.
JER.16.18	And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things.
JER.16.19	O 
JER.16.20	Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?
JER.16.21	Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is The 
JER.17.1	The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;
JER.17.2	Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.
JER.17.3	O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin, throughout all thy borders.
JER.17.4	And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for ever.
JER.17.5	Thus saith the 
JER.17.6	For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.
JER.17.7	Blessed is the man that trusteth in the 
JER.17.8	For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
JER.17.9	The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?
JER.17.10	I the 
JER.17.11	As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.
JER.17.12	A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.
JER.17.13	O 
JER.17.14	Heal me, O 
JER.17.15	Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the 
JER.17.16	As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was right before thee.
JER.17.17	Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.
JER.17.18	Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.
JER.17.19	Thus said the 
JER.17.20	And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the 
JER.17.21	Thus saith the 
JER.17.22	Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.
JER.17.23	But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.
JER.17.24	And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the 
JER.17.25	Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever.
JER.17.26	And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the 
JER.17.27	But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.
JER.18.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.18.2	Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.
JER.18.3	Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.
JER.18.4	And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.
JER.18.5	Then the word of the 
JER.18.6	O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the 
JER.18.7	At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;
JER.18.8	If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.
JER.18.9	And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;
JER.18.10	If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.
JER.18.11	Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.18.12	And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.
JER.18.13	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.18.14	Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?
JER.18.15	Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;
JER.18.16	To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.
JER.18.17	I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
JER.18.18	Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.
JER.18.19	Give heed to me, O 
JER.18.20	Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them.
JER.18.21	Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle.
JER.18.22	Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.
JER.18.23	Yet, 
JER.19.1	Thus saith the 
JER.19.2	And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,
JER.19.3	And say, Hear ye the word of the 
JER.19.4	Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;
JER.19.5	They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:
JER.19.6	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.19.7	And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
JER.19.8	And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.
JER.19.9	And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.
JER.19.10	Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,
JER.19.11	And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.19.12	Thus will I do unto this place, saith the 
JER.19.13	And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Topheth, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods.
JER.19.14	Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, whither the 
JER.19.15	Thus saith the 
JER.20.1	Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the 
JER.20.2	Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the 
JER.20.3	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The 
JER.20.4	For thus saith the 
JER.20.5	Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
JER.20.6	And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.
JER.20.7	O 
JER.20.8	For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the 
JER.20.9	Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.
JER.20.10	For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
JER.20.11	But the 
JER.20.12	But, O 
JER.20.13	Sing unto the 
JER.20.14	Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.
JER.20.15	Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.
JER.20.16	And let that man be as the cities which the 
JER.20.17	Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me.
JER.20.18	Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?
JER.21.1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.21.2	Enquire, I pray thee, of the 
JER.21.3	Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:
JER.21.4	Thus saith the 
JER.21.5	And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.
JER.21.6	And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.
JER.21.7	And afterward, saith the 
JER.21.8	And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the 
JER.21.9	He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.
JER.21.10	For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the 
JER.21.11	And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of the 
JER.21.12	O house of David, thus saith the 
JER.21.13	Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, saith the 
JER.21.14	But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the 
JER.22.1	Thus saith the 
JER.22.2	And say, Hear the word of the 
JER.22.3	Thus saith the 
JER.22.4	For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.
JER.22.5	But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the 
JER.22.6	For thus saith the 
JER.22.7	And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.
JER.22.8	And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the 
JER.22.9	Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the 
JER.22.10	Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.
JER.22.11	For thus saith the 
JER.22.12	But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.
JER.22.13	Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;
JER.22.14	That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
JER.22.15	Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him?
JER.22.16	He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? saith the 
JER.22.17	But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.
JER.22.18	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.22.19	He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
JER.22.20	Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.
JER.22.21	I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.
JER.22.22	The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.
JER.22.23	O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!
JER.22.24	As I live, saith the 
JER.22.25	And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
JER.22.26	And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.
JER.22.27	But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return.
JER.22.28	Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?
JER.22.29	O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the 
JER.22.30	Thus saith the 
JER.23.1	Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the 
JER.23.2	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.23.3	And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.
JER.23.4	And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the 
JER.23.5	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.23.6	In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE 
JER.23.7	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.23.8	But, The 
JER.23.9	Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the 
JER.23.10	For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right.
JER.23.11	For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the 
JER.23.12	Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the 
JER.23.13	And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
JER.23.14	I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
JER.23.15	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.23.16	Thus saith the 
JER.23.17	They say still unto them that despise me, The 
JER.23.18	For who hath stood in the counsel of the 
JER.23.19	Behold, a whirlwind of the 
JER.23.20	The anger of the 
JER.23.21	I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
JER.23.22	But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
JER.23.23	Am I a God at hand, saith the 
JER.23.24	Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the 
JER.23.25	I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
JER.23.26	How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart;
JER.23.27	Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.
JER.23.28	The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the 
JER.23.29	Is not my word like as a fire? saith the 
JER.23.30	Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the 
JER.23.31	Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the 
JER.23.32	Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the 
JER.23.33	And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the 
JER.23.34	And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the 
JER.23.35	Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the 
JER.23.36	And the burden of the 
JER.23.37	Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the 
JER.23.38	But since ye say, The burden of the 
JER.23.39	Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence:
JER.23.40	And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.
JER.24.1	The 
JER.24.2	One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
JER.24.3	Then said the 
JER.24.4	Again the word of the 
JER.24.5	Thus saith the 
JER.24.6	For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
JER.24.7	And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the 
JER.24.8	And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the 
JER.24.9	And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.
JER.24.10	And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.
JER.25.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;
JER.25.2	The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
JER.25.3	From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the 
JER.25.4	And the 
JER.25.5	They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the 
JER.25.6	And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
JER.25.7	Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the 
JER.25.8	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.25.9	Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the 
JER.25.10	Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.
JER.25.11	And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
JER.25.12	And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the 
JER.25.13	And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.
JER.25.14	For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.
JER.25.15	For thus saith the 
JER.25.16	And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
JER.25.17	Then took I the cup at the 
JER.25.18	To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day;
JER.25.19	Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;
JER.25.20	And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,
JER.25.21	Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,
JER.25.22	And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea,
JER.25.23	Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,
JER.25.24	And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert,
JER.25.25	And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,
JER.25.26	And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
JER.25.27	Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.25.28	And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.25.29	For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the 
JER.25.30	Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The 
JER.25.31	A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the 
JER.25.32	Thus saith the 
JER.25.33	And the slain of the 
JER.25.34	Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.
JER.25.35	And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.
JER.25.36	A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the 
JER.25.37	And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the 
JER.25.38	He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.
JER.26.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the 
JER.26.2	Thus saith the 
JER.26.3	If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.
JER.26.4	And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.26.5	To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;
JER.26.6	Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
JER.26.7	So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the 
JER.26.8	Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the 
JER.26.9	Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the 
JER.26.10	When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the 
JER.26.11	Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.
JER.26.12	Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The 
JER.26.13	Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the 
JER.26.14	As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.
JER.26.15	But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the 
JER.26.16	Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the 
JER.26.17	Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,
JER.26.18	Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.26.19	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the 
JER.26.20	And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the 
JER.26.21	And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;
JER.26.22	And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.
JER.26.23	And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
JER.26.24	Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
JER.27.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.27.2	Thus saith the 
JER.27.3	And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;
JER.27.4	And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the 
JER.27.5	I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.
JER.27.6	And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.
JER.27.7	And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.
JER.27.8	And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the 
JER.27.9	Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:
JER.27.10	For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.
JER.27.11	But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the 
JER.27.12	I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
JER.27.13	Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the 
JER.27.14	Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.
JER.27.15	For I have not sent them, saith the 
JER.27.16	Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.27.17	Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?
JER.27.18	But if they be prophets, and if the word of the 
JER.27.19	For thus saith the 
JER.27.20	Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
JER.27.21	Yea, thus saith the 
JER.27.22	They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the 
JER.28.1	And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the 
JER.28.2	Thus speaketh the 
JER.28.3	Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the 
JER.28.4	And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the 
JER.28.5	Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the 
JER.28.6	Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the 
JER.28.7	Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;
JER.28.8	The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
JER.28.9	The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the 
JER.28.10	Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.
JER.28.11	And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.28.12	Then the word of the 
JER.28.13	Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.28.14	For thus saith the 
JER.28.15	Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The 
JER.28.16	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.28.17	So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
JER.29.1	Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;
JER.29.2	(After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)
JER.29.3	By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,
JER.29.4	Thus saith the 
JER.29.5	Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;
JER.29.6	Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.
JER.29.7	And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the 
JER.29.8	For thus saith the 
JER.29.9	For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the 
JER.29.10	For thus saith the 
JER.29.11	For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the 
JER.29.12	Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.
JER.29.13	And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
JER.29.14	And I will be found of you, saith the 
JER.29.15	Because ye have said, The 
JER.29.16	Know that thus saith the 
JER.29.17	Thus saith the 
JER.29.18	And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:
JER.29.19	Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the 
JER.29.20	Hear ye therefore the word of the 
JER.29.21	Thus saith the 
JER.29.22	And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The 
JER.29.23	Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the 
JER.29.24	Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
JER.29.25	Thus speaketh the 
JER.29.26	The 
JER.29.27	Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?
JER.29.28	For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
JER.29.29	And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
JER.29.30	Then came the word of the 
JER.29.31	Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.29.32	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.30.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.30.2	Thus speaketh the 
JER.30.3	For, lo, the days come, saith the 
JER.30.4	And these are the words that the 
JER.30.5	For thus saith the 
JER.30.6	Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
JER.30.7	Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.
JER.30.8	For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the 
JER.30.9	But they shall serve the 
JER.30.10	Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the 
JER.30.11	For I am with thee, saith the 
JER.30.12	For thus saith the 
JER.30.13	There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.
JER.30.14	All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.
JER.30.15	Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.
JER.30.16	Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
JER.30.17	For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the 
JER.30.18	Thus saith the 
JER.30.19	And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
JER.30.20	Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.
JER.30.21	And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the 
JER.30.22	And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
JER.30.23	Behold, the whirlwind of the 
JER.30.24	The fierce anger of the 
JER.31.1	At the same time, saith the 
JER.31.2	Thus saith the 
JER.31.3	The 
JER.31.4	Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
JER.31.5	Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.
JER.31.6	For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the 
JER.31.7	For thus saith the 
JER.31.8	Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.
JER.31.9	They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
JER.31.10	Hear the word of the 
JER.31.11	For the 
JER.31.12	Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the 
JER.31.13	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
JER.31.14	And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the 
JER.31.15	Thus saith the 
JER.31.16	Thus saith the 
JER.31.17	And there is hope in thine end, saith the 
JER.31.18	I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the 
JER.31.19	Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
JER.31.20	Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the 
JER.31.21	Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.
JER.31.22	How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the 
JER.31.23	Thus saith the 
JER.31.24	And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.
JER.31.25	For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.
JER.31.26	Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
JER.31.27	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.31.28	And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the 
JER.31.29	In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.
JER.31.30	But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
JER.31.31	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.31.32	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the 
JER.31.33	But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the 
JER.31.34	And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the 
JER.31.35	Thus saith the 
JER.31.36	If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the 
JER.31.37	Thus saith the 
JER.31.38	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.31.39	And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.
JER.31.40	And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the 
JER.32.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.32.2	For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house.
JER.32.3	For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the 
JER.32.4	And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
JER.32.5	And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the 
JER.32.6	And Jeremiah said, The word of the 
JER.32.7	Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.
JER.32.8	So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the 
JER.32.9	And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.
JER.32.10	And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.
JER.32.11	So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:
JER.32.12	And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.
JER.32.13	And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
JER.32.14	Thus saith the 
JER.32.15	For thus saith the 
JER.32.16	Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the 
JER.32.17	Ah Lord 
JER.32.18	Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the 
JER.32.19	Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:
JER.32.20	Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;
JER.32.21	And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;
JER.32.22	And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
JER.32.23	And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:
JER.32.24	Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.
JER.32.25	And thou hast said unto me, O Lord 
JER.32.26	Then came the word of the 
JER.32.27	Behold, I am the 
JER.32.28	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.32.29	And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.
JER.32.30	For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the 
JER.32.31	For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,
JER.32.32	Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
JER.32.33	And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.
JER.32.34	But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.
JER.32.35	And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
JER.32.36	And now therefore thus saith the 
JER.32.37	Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:
JER.32.38	And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:
JER.32.39	And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:
JER.32.40	And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.
JER.32.41	Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
JER.32.42	For thus saith the 
JER.32.43	And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
JER.32.44	Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the 
JER.33.1	Moreover the word of the 
JER.33.2	Thus saith the 
JER.33.3	Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.
JER.33.4	For thus saith the 
JER.33.5	They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.
JER.33.6	Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.
JER.33.7	And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.
JER.33.8	And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.
JER.33.9	And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.
JER.33.10	Thus saith the 
JER.33.11	The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the 
JER.33.12	Thus saith the 
JER.33.13	In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the 
JER.33.14	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.33.15	In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
JER.33.16	In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The 
JER.33.17	For thus saith the 
JER.33.18	Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.
JER.33.19	And the word of the 
JER.33.20	Thus saith the 
JER.33.21	Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
JER.33.22	As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.
JER.33.23	Moreover the word of the 
JER.33.24	Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the 
JER.33.25	Thus saith the 
JER.33.26	Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.
JER.34.1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.2	Thus saith the 
JER.34.3	And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.
JER.34.4	Yet hear the word of the 
JER.34.5	But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the 
JER.34.6	Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
JER.34.7	When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.
JER.34.8	This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.9	That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.
JER.34.10	Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.
JER.34.11	But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
JER.34.12	Therefore the word of the 
JER.34.13	Thus saith the 
JER.34.14	At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.
JER.34.15	And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:
JER.34.16	But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.
JER.34.17	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.34.18	And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,
JER.34.19	The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;
JER.34.20	I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.
JER.34.21	And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.
JER.34.22	Behold, I will command, saith the 
JER.35.1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.35.2	Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the 
JER.35.3	Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;
JER.35.4	And I brought them into the house of the 
JER.35.5	And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.
JER.35.6	But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever:
JER.35.7	Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers.
JER.35.8	Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jehonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;
JER.35.9	Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
JER.35.10	But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
JER.35.11	But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.
JER.35.12	Then came the word of the 
JER.35.13	Thus saith the 
JER.35.14	The words of Jehonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.
JER.35.15	I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.
JER.35.16	Because the sons of Jehonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:
JER.35.17	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.35.18	And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the 
JER.35.19	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.36.1	And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.36.2	Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.
JER.36.3	It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
JER.36.4	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the 
JER.36.5	And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the 
JER.36.6	Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the 
JER.36.7	It may be they will present their supplication before the 
JER.36.8	And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the 
JER.36.9	And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the 
JER.36.10	Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the 
JER.36.11	When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the 
JER.36.12	Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.
JER.36.13	Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
JER.36.14	Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.
JER.36.15	And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.
JER.36.16	Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.
JER.36.17	And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?
JER.36.18	Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.
JER.36.19	Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.
JER.36.20	And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.
JER.36.21	So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.
JER.36.22	Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.
JER.36.23	And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.
JER.36.24	Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.
JER.36.25	Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.
JER.36.26	But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the 
JER.36.27	Then the word of the 
JER.36.28	Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.
JER.36.29	And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the 
JER.36.30	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.36.31	And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.
JER.36.32	Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.
JER.37.1	And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.
JER.37.2	But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the 
JER.37.3	And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the 
JER.37.4	Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.
JER.37.5	Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.
JER.37.6	Then came the word of the 
JER.37.7	Thus saith the 
JER.37.8	And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.
JER.37.9	Thus saith the 
JER.37.10	For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
JER.37.11	And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,
JER.37.12	Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.
JER.37.13	And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.
JER.37.14	Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
JER.37.15	Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.
JER.37.16	When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;
JER.37.17	Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the 
JER.37.18	Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?
JER.37.19	Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
JER.37.20	Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
JER.37.21	Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
JER.38.1	Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,
JER.38.2	Thus saith the 
JER.38.3	Thus saith the 
JER.38.4	Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
JER.38.5	Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.
JER.38.6	Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.
JER.38.7	Now when Ebed–melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;
JER.38.8	Ebed–melech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king, saying,
JER.38.9	My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.
JER.38.10	Then the king commanded Ebed–melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.
JER.38.11	So Ebed–melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
JER.38.12	And Ebed–melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
JER.38.13	So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
JER.38.14	Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the 
JER.38.15	Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?
JER.38.16	So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the 
JER.38.17	Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the 
JER.38.18	But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.
JER.38.19	And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.
JER.38.20	But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the 
JER.38.21	But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the 
JER.38.22	And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.
JER.38.23	So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.
JER.38.24	Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.
JER.38.25	But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:
JER.38.26	Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.
JER.38.27	Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.
JER.38.28	So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.
JER.39.1	In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.
JER.39.2	And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.
JER.39.3	And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergal–sharezer, Samgar–nebo, Sarsechim, Rab–saris, Nergal–sharezer, Rab–mag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.
JER.39.4	And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.
JER.39.5	But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.
JER.39.6	Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
JER.39.7	Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.
JER.39.8	And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.
JER.39.9	Then Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.
JER.39.10	But Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
JER.39.11	Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard, saying,
JER.39.12	Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.
JER.39.13	So Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab–saris, and Nergal–sharezer, Rab–mag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;
JER.39.14	Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.
JER.39.15	Now the word of the 
JER.39.16	Go and speak to Ebed–melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.39.17	But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the 
JER.39.18	For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the 
JER.40.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.40.2	And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The 
JER.40.3	Now the 
JER.40.4	And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.
JER.40.5	Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.
JER.40.6	Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
JER.40.7	Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;
JER.40.8	Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
JER.40.9	And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
JER.40.10	As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.
JER.40.11	Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;
JER.40.12	Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.
JER.40.13	Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
JER.40.14	And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.
JER.40.15	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.
JER.41.1	Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.
JER.41.2	Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
JER.41.3	Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war.
JER.41.4	And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,
JER.41.5	That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the 
JER.41.6	And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
JER.41.7	And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.
JER.41.8	But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.
JER.41.9	Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.
JER.41.10	Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.
JER.41.11	But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
JER.41.12	Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.
JER.41.13	Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.
JER.41.14	So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.
JER.41.15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
JER.41.16	Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:
JER.41.17	And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Beth–lehem, to go to enter into Egypt,
JER.41.18	Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.
JER.42.1	Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,
JER.42.2	And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the 
JER.42.3	That the 
JER.42.4	Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the 
JER.42.5	Then they said to Jeremiah, The 
JER.42.6	Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the 
JER.42.7	And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the 
JER.42.8	Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,
JER.42.9	And said unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.42.10	If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.
JER.42.11	Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the 
JER.42.12	And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.
JER.42.13	But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the 
JER.42.14	Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:
JER.42.15	And now therefore hear the word of the 
JER.42.16	Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.
JER.42.17	So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.
JER.42.18	For thus saith the 
JER.42.19	The 
JER.42.20	For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the 
JER.42.21	And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the 
JER.42.22	Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn.
JER.43.1	And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the 
JER.43.2	Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the 
JER.43.3	But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.
JER.43.4	So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the 
JER.43.5	But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;
JER.43.6	Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.
JER.43.7	So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the 
JER.43.8	Then came the word of the 
JER.43.9	Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;
JER.43.10	And say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.43.11	And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.
JER.43.12	And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
JER.43.13	He shall break also the images of Beth–shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.
JER.44.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
JER.44.2	Thus saith the 
JER.44.3	Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.
JER.44.4	Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.
JER.44.5	But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.
JER.44.6	Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.
JER.44.7	Therefore now thus saith the 
JER.44.8	In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
JER.44.9	Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
JER.44.10	They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.
JER.44.11	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.44.12	And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
JER.44.13	For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:
JER.44.14	So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.
JER.44.15	Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
JER.44.16	As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the 
JER.44.17	But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.
JER.44.18	But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
JER.44.19	And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?
JER.44.20	Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,
JER.44.21	The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the 
JER.44.22	So that the 
JER.44.23	Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the 
JER.44.24	Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the 
JER.44.25	Thus saith the 
JER.44.26	Therefore hear ye the word of the 
JER.44.27	Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.
JER.44.28	Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.
JER.44.29	And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the 
JER.44.30	Thus saith the 
JER.45.1	The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
JER.45.2	Thus saith the 
JER.45.3	Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the 
JER.45.4	Thus shalt thou say unto him, The 
JER.45.5	And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the 
JER.46.1	The word of the 
JER.46.2	Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh–neco king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.
JER.46.3	Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
JER.46.4	Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.
JER.46.5	Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: for fear was round about, saith the 
JER.46.6	Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.
JER.46.7	Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?
JER.46.8	Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.
JER.46.9	Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Ludim, that handle and bend the bow.
JER.46.10	For this is the day of the Lord 
JER.46.11	Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured.
JER.46.12	The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and they are fallen both together.
JER.46.13	The word that the 
JER.46.14	Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee.
JER.46.15	Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the 
JER.46.16	He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.
JER.46.17	They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath passed the time appointed.
JER.46.18	As I live, saith the King, whose name is the 
JER.46.19	O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Memphis shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.
JER.46.20	Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north.
JER.46.21	Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation.
JER.46.22	The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.
JER.46.23	They shall cut down her forest, saith the 
JER.46.24	The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
JER.46.25	The 
JER.46.26	And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the 
JER.46.27	But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.
JER.46.28	Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the 
JER.47.1	The word of the 
JER.47.2	Thus saith the 
JER.47.3	At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands;
JER.47.4	Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, and to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the 
JER.47.5	Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?
JER.47.6	O thou sword of the 
JER.47.7	How can it be quiet, seeing the 
JER.48.1	Against Moab thus saith the 
JER.48.2	There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.
JER.48.3	A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.
JER.48.4	Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
JER.48.5	For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.
JER.48.6	Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
JER.48.7	For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together.
JER.48.8	And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the 
JER.48.9	Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.
JER.48.10	Cursed be he that doeth the work of the 
JER.48.11	Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
JER.48.12	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.48.13	And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth–el their confidence.
JER.48.14	How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war?
JER.48.15	Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is the 
JER.48.16	The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.
JER.48.17	All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the beautiful rod!
JER.48.18	Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, and he shall destroy thy strong holds.
JER.48.19	O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?
JER.48.20	Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,
JER.48.21	And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath,
JER.48.22	And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth–diblathaim,
JER.48.23	And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth–gamul, and upon Beth–meon,
JER.48.24	And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
JER.48.25	The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the 
JER.48.26	Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the 
JER.48.27	For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.
JER.48.28	O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.
JER.48.29	We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.
JER.48.30	I know his wrath, saith the 
JER.48.31	Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kir–heres.
JER.48.32	O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.
JER.48.33	And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.
JER.48.34	From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.
JER.48.35	Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the 
JER.48.36	Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir–heres: because the riches that he hath gotten are perished.
JER.48.37	For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.
JER.48.38	There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the 
JER.48.39	They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.
JER.48.40	For thus saith the 
JER.48.41	Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
JER.48.42	And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the 
JER.48.43	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the 
JER.48.44	He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the 
JER.48.45	They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
JER.48.46	Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.
JER.48.47	Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the 
JER.49.1	Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the 
JER.49.2	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.49.3	Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.
JER.49.4	Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?
JER.49.5	Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord 
JER.49.6	And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the 
JER.49.7	Concerning Edom, thus saith the 
JER.49.8	Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him.
JER.49.9	If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.
JER.49.10	But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.
JER.49.11	Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.
JER.49.12	For thus saith the 
JER.49.13	For I have sworn by myself, saith the 
JER.49.14	I have heard a rumour from the 
JER.49.15	For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised among men.
JER.49.16	Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the 
JER.49.17	Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.
JER.49.18	As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the 
JER.49.19	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
JER.49.20	Therefore hear the counsel of the 
JER.49.21	The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.
JER.49.22	Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
JER.49.23	Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.
JER.49.24	Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.
JER.49.25	How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!
JER.49.26	Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the 
JER.49.27	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben–hadad.
JER.49.28	Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the 
JER.49.29	Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side.
JER.49.30	Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the 
JER.49.31	Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the 
JER.49.32	And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the 
JER.49.33	And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.
JER.49.34	The word of the 
JER.49.35	Thus saith the 
JER.49.36	And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
JER.49.37	For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the 
JER.49.38	And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the 
JER.49.39	But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the 
JER.50.1	The word that the 
JER.50.2	Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.
JER.50.3	For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.
JER.50.4	In those days, and in that time, saith the 
JER.50.5	They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the 
JER.50.6	My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.
JER.50.7	All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the 
JER.50.8	Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.
JER.50.9	For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.
JER.50.10	And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the 
JER.50.11	Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;
JER.50.12	Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
JER.50.13	Because of the wrath of the 
JER.50.14	Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the 
JER.50.15	Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the 
JER.50.16	Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.
JER.50.17	Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.
JER.50.18	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.50.19	And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.
JER.50.20	In those days, and in that time, saith the 
JER.50.21	Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the 
JER.50.22	A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
JER.50.23	How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
JER.50.24	I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the 
JER.50.25	The 
JER.50.26	Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.
JER.50.27	Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
JER.50.28	The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the 
JER.50.29	Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the 
JER.50.30	Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the 
JER.50.31	Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord 
JER.50.32	And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.
JER.50.33	Thus saith the 
JER.50.34	Their Redeemer is strong; the 
JER.50.35	A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the 
JER.50.36	A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.
JER.50.37	A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.
JER.50.38	A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.
JER.50.39	Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
JER.50.40	As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the 
JER.50.41	Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
JER.50.42	They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
JER.50.43	The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.
JER.50.44	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
JER.50.45	Therefore hear ye the counsel of the 
JER.50.46	At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.
JER.51.1	Thus saith the 
JER.51.2	And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.
JER.51.3	Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.
JER.51.4	Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.
JER.51.5	For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the 
JER.51.6	Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the 
JER.51.7	Babylon hath been a golden cup in the 
JER.51.8	Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.
JER.51.9	We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.
JER.51.10	The 
JER.51.11	Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the 
JER.51.12	Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the 
JER.51.13	O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.
JER.51.14	The 
JER.51.15	He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.
JER.51.16	When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
JER.51.17	Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
JER.51.18	They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
JER.51.19	The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the 
JER.51.20	Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;
JER.51.21	And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;
JER.51.22	With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;
JER.51.23	I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.
JER.51.24	And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the 
JER.51.25	Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the 
JER.51.26	And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the 
JER.51.27	Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.
JER.51.28	Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.
JER.51.29	And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the 
JER.51.30	The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.
JER.51.31	One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,
JER.51.32	And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
JER.51.33	For thus saith the 
JER.51.34	Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.
JER.51.35	The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
JER.51.36	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.51.37	And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.
JER.51.38	They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions' whelps.
JER.51.39	In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the 
JER.51.40	I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.
JER.51.41	How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!
JER.51.42	The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.
JER.51.43	Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.
JER.51.44	And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
JER.51.45	My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the 
JER.51.46	And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.
JER.51.47	Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
JER.51.48	Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the 
JER.51.49	As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.
JER.51.50	Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the 
JER.51.51	We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the 
JER.51.52	Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.51.53	Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the 
JER.51.54	A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:
JER.51.55	Because the 
JER.51.56	Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the 
JER.51.57	And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the 
JER.51.58	Thus saith the 
JER.51.59	The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.
JER.51.60	So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.
JER.51.61	And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;
JER.51.62	Then shalt thou say, O 
JER.51.63	And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:
JER.51.64	And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
JER.52.2	And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the 
JER.52.3	For through the anger of the 
JER.52.4	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.
JER.52.5	So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
JER.52.6	And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
JER.52.7	Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.
JER.52.8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
JER.52.9	Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.
JER.52.10	And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
JER.52.11	Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
JER.52.12	Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar–adan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,
JER.52.13	And burned the house of the 
JER.52.14	And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
JER.52.15	Then Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
JER.52.16	But Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.
JER.52.17	Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the 
JER.52.18	The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.
JER.52.19	And the basins, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away.
JER.52.20	The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the 
JER.52.21	And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.
JER.52.22	And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these.
JER.52.23	And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.
JER.52.24	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
JER.52.25	He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.
JER.52.26	So Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
JER.52.27	And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.
JER.52.28	This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:
JER.52.29	In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:
JER.52.30	In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.
JER.52.31	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil–merodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison,
JER.52.32	And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,
JER.52.33	And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.
JER.52.34	And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.
LAM.1.1	How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!
LAM.1.2	She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.
LAM.1.3	Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.
LAM.1.4	The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.
LAM.1.5	Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the 
LAM.1.6	And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
LAM.1.7	Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.
LAM.1.9	Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O 
LAM.1.10	The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.
LAM.1.11	All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O 
LAM.1.12	Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the 
LAM.1.13	From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.
LAM.1.14	The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.
LAM.1.15	The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.
LAM.1.16	For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.
LAM.1.17	Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the 
LAM.1.18	The 
LAM.1.19	I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.
LAM.1.20	Behold, O 
LAM.1.21	They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.
LAM.1.22	Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.
LAM.2.1	How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!
LAM.2.2	The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.
LAM.2.3	He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.
LAM.2.4	He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.
LAM.2.5	The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
LAM.2.6	And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the 
LAM.2.7	The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the 
LAM.2.8	The 
LAM.2.9	Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the 
LAM.2.10	The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
LAM.2.11	Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
LAM.2.12	They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.
LAM.2.13	What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?
LAM.2.14	Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.
LAM.2.15	All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
LAM.2.16	All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.
LAM.2.17	The 
LAM.2.18	Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.
LAM.2.19	Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.
LAM.2.20	Behold, O 
LAM.2.21	The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.
LAM.2.22	Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the 
LAM.3.1	I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
LAM.3.2	He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.
LAM.3.3	Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day.
LAM.3.4	My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.
LAM.3.5	He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.
LAM.3.6	He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.
LAM.3.7	He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.
LAM.3.8	Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.
LAM.3.9	He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.
LAM.3.10	He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.
LAM.3.11	He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.
LAM.3.12	He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
LAM.3.13	He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
LAM.3.14	I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.
LAM.3.15	He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.
LAM.3.16	He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.
LAM.3.17	And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.
LAM.3.18	And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the 
LAM.3.19	Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
LAM.3.20	My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
LAM.3.21	This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.
LAM.3.22	It is of the 
LAM.3.23	They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.
LAM.3.24	The 
LAM.3.25	The 
LAM.3.26	It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the 
LAM.3.27	It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
LAM.3.28	He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.
LAM.3.29	He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.
LAM.3.30	He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.
LAM.3.31	For the Lord will not cast off for ever:
LAM.3.32	But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
LAM.3.33	For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.
LAM.3.34	To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
LAM.3.35	To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,
LAM.3.36	To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.
LAM.3.37	Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?
LAM.3.38	Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?
LAM.3.39	Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
LAM.3.40	Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the 
LAM.3.41	Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.
LAM.3.42	We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.
LAM.3.43	Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
LAM.3.44	Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.
LAM.3.45	Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.
LAM.3.46	All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
LAM.3.47	Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.
LAM.3.48	Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LAM.3.49	Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
LAM.3.50	Till the 
LAM.3.51	Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.
LAM.3.52	Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.
LAM.3.53	They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.
LAM.3.54	Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.
LAM.3.55	I called upon thy name, O 
LAM.3.56	Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
LAM.3.57	Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.
LAM.3.58	O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.
LAM.3.59	O 
LAM.3.60	Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.
LAM.3.61	Thou hast heard their reproach, O 
LAM.3.62	The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
LAM.3.63	Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick.
LAM.3.64	Render unto them a recompence, O 
LAM.3.65	Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.
LAM.3.66	Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the 
LAM.4.1	How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.
LAM.4.2	The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
LAM.4.3	Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
LAM.4.4	The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.
LAM.4.5	They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
LAM.4.6	For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.
LAM.4.7	Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire:
LAM.4.8	Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.
LAM.4.9	They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field.
LAM.4.10	The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LAM.4.11	The 
LAM.4.12	The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.
LAM.4.13	For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,
LAM.4.14	They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.
LAM.4.15	They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.
LAM.4.16	The anger of the 
LAM.4.17	As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.
LAM.4.18	They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.
LAM.4.19	Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
LAM.4.20	The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the 
LAM.4.21	Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.
LAM.4.22	The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.
LAM.5.1	Remember, O 
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.
LAM.5.3	We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.
LAM.5.4	We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.
LAM.5.5	Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.
LAM.5.6	We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
LAM.5.7	Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities.
LAM.5.8	Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand.
LAM.5.9	We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.
LAM.5.10	Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.
LAM.5.11	They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah.
LAM.5.12	Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.
LAM.5.13	They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.
LAM.5.14	The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.
LAM.5.15	The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.
LAM.5.16	The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!
LAM.5.17	For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim.
LAM.5.18	Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.
LAM.5.19	Thou, O 
LAM.5.20	Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time?
LAM.5.21	Turn thou us unto thee, O 
LAM.5.22	But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
EZK.1.1	Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
EZK.1.2	In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,
EZK.1.3	The word of the 
EZK.1.4	And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.
EZK.1.5	Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.
EZK.1.6	And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
EZK.1.7	And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.
EZK.1.8	And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.
EZK.1.9	Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.
EZK.1.10	As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.
EZK.1.11	Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
EZK.1.12	And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.
EZK.1.13	As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
EZK.1.14	And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
EZK.1.15	Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.
EZK.1.16	The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
EZK.1.17	When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.
EZK.1.18	As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.
EZK.1.19	And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
EZK.1.20	Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
EZK.1.21	When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
EZK.1.22	And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.
EZK.1.23	And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.
EZK.1.24	And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.
EZK.1.25	And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.
EZK.1.26	And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.
EZK.1.27	And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.
EZK.1.28	As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the 
EZK.2.1	And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.
EZK.2.2	And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.
EZK.2.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.
EZK.2.4	For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.2.5	And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.
EZK.2.6	And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.
EZK.2.7	And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.
EZK.2.8	But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.
EZK.2.9	And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;
EZK.2.10	And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
EZK.3.1	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
EZK.3.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
EZK.3.4	And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
EZK.3.5	For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;
EZK.3.6	Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.
EZK.3.7	But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.
EZK.3.8	Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.
EZK.3.9	As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.
EZK.3.10	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.
EZK.3.11	And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.3.12	Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the 
EZK.3.13	I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.
EZK.3.14	So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the 
EZK.3.15	Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel–abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.
EZK.3.16	And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the 
EZK.3.17	Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
EZK.3.18	When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
EZK.3.19	Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
EZK.3.20	Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
EZK.3.21	Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.
EZK.3.22	And the hand of the 
EZK.3.23	Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the 
EZK.3.24	Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.
EZK.3.25	But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:
EZK.3.26	And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.
EZK.3.27	But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.4.1	Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it the city, even Jerusalem:
EZK.4.2	And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about.
EZK.4.3	Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.
EZK.4.4	Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.
EZK.4.5	For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
EZK.4.6	And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.
EZK.4.7	Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.
EZK.4.8	And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.
EZK.4.9	Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.
EZK.4.10	And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.
EZK.4.11	Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.
EZK.4.12	And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.
EZK.4.13	And the 
EZK.4.14	Then said I, Ah Lord 
EZK.4.15	Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.
EZK.4.16	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:
EZK.4.17	That they may want bread and water, and be astonished one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.
EZK.5.1	And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.
EZK.5.2	Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.
EZK.5.3	Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.
EZK.5.4	Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.
EZK.5.5	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.5.6	And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.
EZK.5.7	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.5.8	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.5.9	And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.
EZK.5.10	Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.
EZK.5.11	Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.5.12	A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.
EZK.5.13	Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the 
EZK.5.14	Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.
EZK.5.15	So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the 
EZK.5.16	When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:
EZK.5.17	So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the 
EZK.6.1	And the word of the 
EZK.6.2	Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
EZK.6.3	And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord 
EZK.6.4	And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.
EZK.6.5	And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.
EZK.6.6	In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.
EZK.6.7	And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.6.8	Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.
EZK.6.9	And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
EZK.6.10	And they shall know that I am the 
EZK.6.11	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.6.12	He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.
EZK.6.13	Then shall ye know that I am the 
EZK.6.14	So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.7.1	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.7.2	Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.7.3	Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.
EZK.7.4	And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.7.5	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.7.6	An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.
EZK.7.7	The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.
EZK.7.8	Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.
EZK.7.9	And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.7.10	Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.
EZK.7.11	Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither shall there be wailing for them.
EZK.7.12	The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
EZK.7.13	For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.
EZK.7.14	They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
EZK.7.15	The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
EZK.7.16	But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.
EZK.7.17	All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.
EZK.7.18	They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.
EZK.7.19	They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the 
EZK.7.20	As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.
EZK.7.21	And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.
EZK.7.22	My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.
EZK.7.23	Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
EZK.7.24	Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.
EZK.7.25	Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.
EZK.7.26	Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.
EZK.7.27	The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.8.1	And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord 
EZK.8.2	Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.
EZK.8.3	And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.
EZK.8.4	And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.
EZK.8.5	Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.
EZK.8.6	He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations.
EZK.8.7	And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.
EZK.8.8	Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.
EZK.8.9	And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.
EZK.8.10	So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.
EZK.8.11	And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.
EZK.8.12	Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The 
EZK.8.13	He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.
EZK.8.14	Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the 
EZK.8.15	Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.
EZK.8.16	And he brought me into the inner court of the 
EZK.8.17	Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.
EZK.8.18	Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.
EZK.9.1	He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.
EZK.9.2	And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar.
EZK.9.3	And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side;
EZK.9.4	And the 
EZK.9.5	And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:
EZK.9.6	Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.
EZK.9.7	And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.
EZK.9.8	And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord 
EZK.9.9	Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The 
EZK.9.10	And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.
EZK.9.11	And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.
EZK.10.1	Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
EZK.10.2	And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.
EZK.10.3	Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
EZK.10.4	Then the glory of the 
EZK.10.5	And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.
EZK.10.6	And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.
EZK.10.7	And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.
EZK.10.8	And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.
EZK.10.9	And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.
EZK.10.10	And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.
EZK.10.11	When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.
EZK.10.12	And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.
EZK.10.13	As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.
EZK.10.14	And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
EZK.10.15	And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.
EZK.10.16	And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.
EZK.10.17	When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.
EZK.10.18	Then the glory of the 
EZK.10.19	And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the 
EZK.10.20	This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.
EZK.10.21	Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
EZK.10.22	And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.
EZK.11.1	Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the 
EZK.11.2	Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:
EZK.11.3	Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the flesh.
EZK.11.4	Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
EZK.11.5	And the Spirit of the 
EZK.11.6	Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.
EZK.11.7	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.11.8	Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord 
EZK.11.9	And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.
EZK.11.10	Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.11.11	This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of Israel:
EZK.11.12	And ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.11.13	And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord 
EZK.11.14	Again the word of the 
EZK.11.15	Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the 
EZK.11.16	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.11.17	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.11.18	And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.
EZK.11.19	And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:
EZK.11.20	That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
EZK.11.21	But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord 
EZK.11.22	Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
EZK.11.23	And the glory of the 
EZK.11.24	Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.
EZK.11.25	Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the 
EZK.12.1	The word of the 
EZK.12.2	Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.
EZK.12.3	Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.
EZK.12.4	Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.
EZK.12.5	Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
EZK.12.6	In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.
EZK.12.7	And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.
EZK.12.8	And in the morning came the word of the 
EZK.12.9	Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?
EZK.12.10	Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.12.11	Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove and go into captivity.
EZK.12.12	And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.
EZK.12.13	My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.
EZK.12.14	And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.
EZK.12.15	And they shall know that I am the 
EZK.12.16	But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.12.17	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.12.18	Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;
EZK.12.19	And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.12.20	And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.12.21	And the word of the 
EZK.12.22	Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?
EZK.12.23	Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.12.24	For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
EZK.12.25	For I am the 
EZK.12.26	Again the word of the 
EZK.12.27	Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off.
EZK.12.28	Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.1	And the word of the 
EZK.13.2	Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the 
EZK.13.3	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.4	O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
EZK.13.5	Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the 
EZK.13.6	They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The 
EZK.13.7	Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The 
EZK.13.8	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.9	And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord 
EZK.13.10	Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered mortar:
EZK.13.11	Say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.
EZK.13.12	Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?
EZK.13.13	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.14	So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.13.15	Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered mortar, and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;
EZK.13.16	To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord 
EZK.13.17	Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,
EZK.13.18	And say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.19	And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?
EZK.13.20	Wherefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.21	Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.13.22	Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:
EZK.13.23	Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.14.1	Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.
EZK.14.2	And the word of the 
EZK.14.3	Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?
EZK.14.4	Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.14.5	That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
EZK.14.6	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.14.7	For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the 
EZK.14.8	And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.14.9	And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the 
EZK.14.10	And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him;
EZK.14.11	That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord 
EZK.14.12	The word of the 
EZK.14.13	Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:
EZK.14.14	Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord 
EZK.14.15	If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:
EZK.14.16	Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.14.17	Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:
EZK.14.18	Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.14.19	Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:
EZK.14.20	Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.14.21	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.14.22	Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.
EZK.14.23	And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord 
EZK.15.1	And the word of the 
EZK.15.2	Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?
EZK.15.3	Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
EZK.15.4	Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?
EZK.15.5	Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?
EZK.15.6	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.15.7	And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.15.8	And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.1	Again the word of the 
EZK.16.2	Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,
EZK.16.3	And say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.16.4	And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.
EZK.16.5	None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.
EZK.16.6	And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.
EZK.16.7	I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare.
EZK.16.8	Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.9	Then washed I thee with water; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
EZK.16.10	I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.
EZK.16.11	I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.
EZK.16.12	And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.
EZK.16.13	Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.
EZK.16.14	And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.15	But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.
EZK.16.16	And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.
EZK.16.17	Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,
EZK.16.18	And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.
EZK.16.19	My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.20	Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,
EZK.16.21	That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?
EZK.16.22	And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.
EZK.16.23	And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord 
EZK.16.24	That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.
EZK.16.25	Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.
EZK.16.26	Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.
EZK.16.27	Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.
EZK.16.28	Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.
EZK.16.29	Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.
EZK.16.30	How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.31	In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;
EZK.16.32	But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!
EZK.16.33	They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.
EZK.16.34	And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.
EZK.16.35	Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the 
EZK.16.36	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.16.37	Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
EZK.16.38	And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.
EZK.16.39	And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.
EZK.16.40	They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.
EZK.16.41	And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.
EZK.16.42	So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.
EZK.16.43	Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.44	Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.
EZK.16.45	Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
EZK.16.46	And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.
EZK.16.47	Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.
EZK.16.48	As I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.49	Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
EZK.16.50	And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.
EZK.16.51	Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.
EZK.16.52	Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
EZK.16.53	When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:
EZK.16.54	That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.
EZK.16.55	When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.
EZK.16.56	For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,
EZK.16.57	Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.
EZK.16.58	Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the 
EZK.16.59	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.16.60	Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.
EZK.16.61	Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.
EZK.16.62	And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the 
EZK.16.63	That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord 
EZK.17.1	And the word of the 
EZK.17.2	Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;
EZK.17.3	And say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.17.4	He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.
EZK.17.5	He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.
EZK.17.6	And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
EZK.17.7	There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.
EZK.17.8	It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.
EZK.17.9	Say thou, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.17.10	Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.
EZK.17.11	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.17.12	Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;
EZK.17.13	And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:
EZK.17.14	That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.
EZK.17.15	But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?
EZK.17.16	As I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.17.17	Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:
EZK.17.18	Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape.
EZK.17.19	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.17.20	And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.
EZK.17.21	And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the 
EZK.17.22	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.17.23	In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.
EZK.17.24	And all the trees of the field shall know that I the 
EZK.18.1	The word of the 
EZK.18.2	What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?
EZK.18.3	As I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.18.4	Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.
EZK.18.5	But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,
EZK.18.6	And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,
EZK.18.7	And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;
EZK.18.8	He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man,
EZK.18.9	Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord 
EZK.18.10	If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any one of these things,
EZK.18.11	And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,
EZK.18.12	Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,
EZK.18.13	Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
EZK.18.14	Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,
EZK.18.15	That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's wife,
EZK.18.16	Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,
EZK.18.17	That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.
EZK.18.18	As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.
EZK.18.19	Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.
EZK.18.20	The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
EZK.18.21	But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
EZK.18.22	All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.
EZK.18.23	Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord 
EZK.18.24	But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
EZK.18.25	Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?
EZK.18.26	When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.
EZK.18.27	Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.
EZK.18.28	Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
EZK.18.29	Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?
EZK.18.30	Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord 
EZK.18.31	Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
EZK.18.32	For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord 
EZK.19.1	Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
EZK.19.2	And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.
EZK.19.3	And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.
EZK.19.4	The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.
EZK.19.5	Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.
EZK.19.6	And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.
EZK.19.7	And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring.
EZK.19.8	Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.
EZK.19.9	And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
EZK.19.10	Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.
EZK.19.11	And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.
EZK.19.12	But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.
EZK.19.13	And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.
EZK.19.14	And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.
EZK.20.1	And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the 
EZK.20.2	Then came the word of the 
EZK.20.3	Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.4	Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:
EZK.20.5	And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.6	In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:
EZK.20.7	Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the 
EZK.20.8	But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
EZK.20.9	But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
EZK.20.10	Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
EZK.20.11	And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.
EZK.20.12	Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the 
EZK.20.13	But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
EZK.20.14	But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.
EZK.20.15	Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;
EZK.20.16	Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.
EZK.20.17	Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.
EZK.20.18	But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:
EZK.20.19	I am the 
EZK.20.20	And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the 
EZK.20.21	Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
EZK.20.22	Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.
EZK.20.23	I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;
EZK.20.24	Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.
EZK.20.25	Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;
EZK.20.26	And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the 
EZK.20.27	Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.28	For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.
EZK.20.29	Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.
EZK.20.30	Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.31	For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.20.32	And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
EZK.20.33	As I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.20.34	And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
EZK.20.35	And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.
EZK.20.36	Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord 
EZK.20.37	And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:
EZK.20.38	And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.20.39	As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.40	For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord 
EZK.20.41	I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.
EZK.20.42	And ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.20.43	And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.
EZK.20.44	And ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.20.45	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.20.46	Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;
EZK.20.47	And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the 
EZK.20.48	And all flesh shall see that I the 
EZK.20.49	Then said I, Ah Lord 
EZK.21.1	And the word of the 
EZK.21.2	Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,
EZK.21.3	And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the 
EZK.21.4	Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
EZK.21.5	That all flesh may know that I the 
EZK.21.6	Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.
EZK.21.7	And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord 
EZK.21.8	Again the word of the 
EZK.21.9	Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the 
EZK.21.10	It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree.
EZK.21.11	And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
EZK.21.12	Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh.
EZK.21.13	Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod? it shall be no more, saith the Lord 
EZK.21.14	Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.
EZK.21.15	I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.
EZK.21.16	Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set.
EZK.21.17	I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the 
EZK.21.18	The word of the 
EZK.21.19	Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.
EZK.21.20	Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbah of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.
EZK.21.21	For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.
EZK.21.22	At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.
EZK.21.23	And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.
EZK.21.24	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.21.25	And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,
EZK.21.26	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.21.27	I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.
EZK.21.28	And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.21.29	Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.
EZK.21.30	Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.
EZK.21.31	And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.
EZK.21.32	Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the 
EZK.22.1	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.22.2	Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.
EZK.22.3	Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.22.4	Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.
EZK.22.5	Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.
EZK.22.6	Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.
EZK.22.7	In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.
EZK.22.8	Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.
EZK.22.9	In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.
EZK.22.10	In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.
EZK.22.11	And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.
EZK.22.12	In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord 
EZK.22.13	Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.
EZK.22.14	Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the 
EZK.22.15	And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.
EZK.22.16	And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the 
EZK.22.17	And the word of the 
EZK.22.18	Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.
EZK.22.19	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.22.20	As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.
EZK.22.21	Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.
EZK.22.22	As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the 
EZK.22.23	And the word of the 
EZK.22.24	Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
EZK.22.25	There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.
EZK.22.26	Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
EZK.22.27	Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.
EZK.22.28	And her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.22.29	The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
EZK.22.30	And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
EZK.22.31	Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord 
EZK.23.1	The word of the 
EZK.23.2	Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
EZK.23.3	And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.
EZK.23.4	And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.
EZK.23.5	And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,
EZK.23.6	Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
EZK.23.7	Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.
EZK.23.8	Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.
EZK.23.9	Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
EZK.23.10	These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.
EZK.23.11	And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.
EZK.23.12	She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
EZK.23.13	Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,
EZK.23.14	And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,
EZK.23.15	Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:
EZK.23.16	And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.
EZK.23.17	And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.
EZK.23.18	So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.
EZK.23.19	Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
EZK.23.20	For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
EZK.23.21	Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.
EZK.23.22	Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.23	The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.
EZK.23.24	And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.
EZK.23.25	And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.
EZK.23.26	They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.
EZK.23.27	Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.
EZK.23.28	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.29	And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
EZK.23.30	I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.
EZK.23.31	Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.
EZK.23.32	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.33	Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.
EZK.23.34	Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord 
EZK.23.35	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.36	The 
EZK.23.37	That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.
EZK.23.38	Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
EZK.23.39	For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.
EZK.23.40	And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,
EZK.23.41	And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.
EZK.23.42	And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
EZK.23.43	Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?
EZK.23.44	Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.
EZK.23.45	And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
EZK.23.46	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.47	And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.
EZK.23.48	Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
EZK.23.49	And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord 
EZK.24.1	Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the 
EZK.24.2	Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.
EZK.24.3	And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.24.4	Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.
EZK.24.5	Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.
EZK.24.6	Wherefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.24.7	For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;
EZK.24.8	That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.
EZK.24.9	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.24.10	Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.
EZK.24.11	Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.
EZK.24.12	She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.
EZK.24.13	In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.
EZK.24.14	I the 
EZK.24.15	Also the word of the 
EZK.24.16	Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.
EZK.24.17	Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.
EZK.24.18	So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
EZK.24.19	And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?
EZK.24.20	Then I answered them, The word of the 
EZK.24.21	Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.24.22	And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.
EZK.24.23	And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.
EZK.24.24	Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the Lord 
EZK.24.25	Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,
EZK.24.26	That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?
EZK.24.27	In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.25.1	The word of the 
EZK.25.2	Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;
EZK.25.3	And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord 
EZK.25.4	Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.
EZK.25.5	And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.25.6	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.7	Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the 
EZK.25.8	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.9	Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth–jeshimoth, Baal–meon, and Kiriathaim,
EZK.25.10	Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.
EZK.25.11	And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.25.12	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.13	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.14	And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord 
EZK.25.15	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.16	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.17	And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.26.1	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of the 
EZK.26.2	Son of man, because that Tyre hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste:
EZK.26.3	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.26.4	And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.
EZK.26.5	It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord 
EZK.26.6	And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.26.7	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.26.8	He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee.
EZK.26.9	And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.
EZK.26.10	By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.
EZK.26.11	With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.
EZK.26.12	And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.
EZK.26.13	And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.
EZK.26.14	And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the 
EZK.26.15	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.26.16	Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at thee.
EZK.26.17	And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it!
EZK.26.18	Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.
EZK.26.19	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.26.20	When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;
EZK.26.21	I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more: though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord 
EZK.27.1	The word of the 
EZK.27.2	Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre;
EZK.27.3	And say unto Tyre, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, which art a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.27.4	Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.
EZK.27.5	They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.
EZK.27.6	Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of Kittim.
EZK.27.7	Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.
EZK.27.8	The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise men, O Tyre, that were in thee, were thy pilots.
EZK.27.9	The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.
EZK.27.10	They of Persia and of Lud and of Put were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.
EZK.27.11	The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.
EZK.27.12	Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.
EZK.27.13	Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.
EZK.27.14	They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.
EZK.27.15	The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee for a present horns of ivory and ebony.
EZK.27.16	Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.
EZK.27.17	Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.
EZK.27.18	Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.
EZK.27.19	Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.
EZK.27.20	Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.
EZK.27.21	Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy merchants.
EZK.27.22	The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.
EZK.27.23	Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were thy merchants.
EZK.27.24	These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.
EZK.27.25	The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.
EZK.27.26	Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.
EZK.27.27	Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.
EZK.27.28	The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.
EZK.27.29	And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;
EZK.27.30	And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:
EZK.27.31	And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing.
EZK.27.32	And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyre, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?
EZK.27.33	When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.
EZK.27.34	In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.
EZK.27.35	All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their countenance.
EZK.27.36	The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt be any more.
EZK.28.1	The word of the 
EZK.28.2	Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.3	Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee:
EZK.28.4	With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures:
EZK.28.5	By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches:
EZK.28.6	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.7	Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.
EZK.28.8	They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.
EZK.28.9	Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.
EZK.28.10	Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord 
EZK.28.11	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.28.12	Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.13	Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.
EZK.28.14	Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.
EZK.28.15	Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.
EZK.28.16	By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
EZK.28.17	Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.
EZK.28.18	Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.
EZK.28.19	All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.
EZK.28.20	Again the word of the 
EZK.28.21	Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,
EZK.28.22	And say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.23	For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.28.24	And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord 
EZK.28.25	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.26	And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.29.1	In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of the 
EZK.29.2	Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:
EZK.29.3	Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.29.4	But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.
EZK.29.5	And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.
EZK.29.6	And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the 
EZK.29.7	When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.
EZK.29.8	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.29.9	And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.29.10	Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.
EZK.29.11	No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
EZK.29.12	And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
EZK.29.13	Yet thus saith the Lord 
EZK.29.14	And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.
EZK.29.15	It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
EZK.29.16	And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord 
EZK.29.17	And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the 
EZK.29.18	Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyre, for the service that he had served against it:
EZK.29.19	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.29.20	I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord 
EZK.29.21	In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.30.1	The word of the 
EZK.30.2	Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.30.3	For the day is near, even the day of the 
EZK.30.4	And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.
EZK.30.5	Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.
EZK.30.6	Thus saith the 
EZK.30.7	And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.
EZK.30.8	And they shall know that I am the 
EZK.30.9	In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh.
EZK.30.10	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.30.11	He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
EZK.30.12	And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the 
EZK.30.13	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.30.14	And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No.
EZK.30.15	And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.
EZK.30.16	And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Memphis shall have distresses daily.
EZK.30.17	The young men of Aven and of Pi–beseth shall fall by the sword: and these cities shall go into captivity.
EZK.30.18	At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
EZK.30.19	Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.30.20	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the 
EZK.30.21	Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.
EZK.30.22	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.30.23	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
EZK.30.24	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.
EZK.30.25	But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.30.26	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.31.1	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the 
EZK.31.2	Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?
EZK.31.3	Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.
EZK.31.4	The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.
EZK.31.5	Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.
EZK.31.6	All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.
EZK.31.7	Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.
EZK.31.8	The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.
EZK.31.9	I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.
EZK.31.10	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.31.11	I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.
EZK.31.12	And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
EZK.31.13	Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:
EZK.31.14	To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
EZK.31.15	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.31.16	I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
EZK.31.17	They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.
EZK.31.18	To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord 
EZK.32.1	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the 
EZK.32.2	Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.
EZK.32.3	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.32.4	Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.
EZK.32.5	And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.
EZK.32.6	I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.
EZK.32.7	And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.
EZK.32.8	All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord 
EZK.32.9	I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.
EZK.32.10	Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.
EZK.32.11	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.32.12	By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.
EZK.32.13	I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
EZK.32.14	Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord 
EZK.32.15	When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the 
EZK.32.16	This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord 
EZK.32.17	It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the 
EZK.32.18	Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.
EZK.32.19	Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.
EZK.32.20	They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her multitudes.
EZK.32.21	The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
EZK.32.22	Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword:
EZK.32.23	Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.
EZK.32.24	There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.
EZK.32.25	They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain.
EZK.32.26	There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.
EZK.32.27	And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
EZK.32.28	Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword.
EZK.32.29	There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.
EZK.32.30	There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.
EZK.32.31	Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord 
EZK.32.32	For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord 
EZK.33.1	Again the word of the 
EZK.33.2	Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:
EZK.33.3	If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;
EZK.33.4	Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
EZK.33.5	He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.
EZK.33.6	But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
EZK.33.7	So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.
EZK.33.8	When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
EZK.33.9	Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
EZK.33.10	Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?
EZK.33.11	Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.33.12	Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.
EZK.33.13	When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.
EZK.33.14	Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
EZK.33.15	If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.
EZK.33.16	None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
EZK.33.17	Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.
EZK.33.18	When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.
EZK.33.19	But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.
EZK.33.20	Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.
EZK.33.21	And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.
EZK.33.22	Now the hand of the 
EZK.33.23	Then the word of the 
EZK.33.24	Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.
EZK.33.25	Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.33.26	Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?
EZK.33.27	Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.33.28	For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.
EZK.33.29	Then shall they know that I am the 
EZK.33.30	Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the 
EZK.33.31	And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness.
EZK.33.32	And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not.
EZK.33.33	And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.
EZK.34.1	And the word of the 
EZK.34.2	Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.34.3	Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.
EZK.34.4	The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.
EZK.34.5	And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.
EZK.34.6	My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.
EZK.34.7	Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the 
EZK.34.8	As I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.34.9	Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the 
EZK.34.10	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.34.11	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.34.12	As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
EZK.34.13	And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
EZK.34.14	I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.
EZK.34.15	I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord 
EZK.34.16	I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.
EZK.34.17	And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.34.18	Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?
EZK.34.19	And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.
EZK.34.20	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.34.21	Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;
EZK.34.22	Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.
EZK.34.23	And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
EZK.34.24	And I the 
EZK.34.25	And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
EZK.34.26	And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.
EZK.34.27	And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the 
EZK.34.28	And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.
EZK.34.29	And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.
EZK.34.30	Thus shall they know that I the 
EZK.34.31	And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord 
EZK.35.1	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.35.2	Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
EZK.35.3	And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.35.4	I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the 
EZK.35.5	Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end:
EZK.35.6	Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.35.7	Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.
EZK.35.8	And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.
EZK.35.9	I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.35.10	Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the 
EZK.35.11	Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.35.12	And thou shalt know that I am the 
EZK.35.13	Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.
EZK.35.14	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.35.15	As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.36.1	Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the 
EZK.36.2	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.3	Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.4	Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord 
EZK.36.5	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.6	Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.7	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.8	But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come.
EZK.36.9	For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown:
EZK.36.10	And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded:
EZK.36.11	And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.36.12	Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men.
EZK.36.13	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.14	Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord 
EZK.36.15	Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord 
EZK.36.16	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.36.17	Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.
EZK.36.18	Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it:
EZK.36.19	And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.
EZK.36.20	And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the 
EZK.36.21	But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.
EZK.36.22	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.23	And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the 
EZK.36.24	For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.
EZK.36.25	Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.
EZK.36.26	A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.
EZK.36.27	And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.
EZK.36.28	And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
EZK.36.29	I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.
EZK.36.30	And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.
EZK.36.31	Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.
EZK.36.32	Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord 
EZK.36.33	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.34	And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.
EZK.36.35	And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.
EZK.36.36	Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the 
EZK.36.37	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.38	As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.37.1	The hand of the 
EZK.37.2	And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.
EZK.37.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord 
EZK.37.4	Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the 
EZK.37.5	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.6	And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.37.7	So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.
EZK.37.8	And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.
EZK.37.9	Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.10	So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
EZK.37.11	Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.
EZK.37.12	Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.13	And ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.37.14	And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the 
EZK.37.15	The word of the 
EZK.37.16	Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:
EZK.37.17	And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.
EZK.37.18	And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?
EZK.37.19	Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.20	And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.
EZK.37.21	And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.22	And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:
EZK.37.23	Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
EZK.37.24	And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.
EZK.37.25	And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever.
EZK.37.26	Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
EZK.37.27	My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
EZK.37.28	And the heathen shall know that I the 
EZK.38.1	And the word of the 
EZK.38.2	Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
EZK.38.3	And say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.38.4	And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:
EZK.38.5	Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet:
EZK.38.6	Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee.
EZK.38.7	Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.
EZK.38.8	After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them.
EZK.38.9	Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.
EZK.38.10	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.38.11	And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,
EZK.38.12	To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.
EZK.38.13	Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?
EZK.38.14	Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.38.15	And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army:
EZK.38.16	And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
EZK.38.17	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.38.18	And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord 
EZK.38.19	For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;
EZK.38.20	So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
EZK.38.21	And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord 
EZK.38.22	And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.
EZK.38.23	Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.39.1	Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.39.2	And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:
EZK.39.3	And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.
EZK.39.4	Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.
EZK.39.5	Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord 
EZK.39.6	And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.39.7	So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall know that I am the 
EZK.39.8	Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord 
EZK.39.9	And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:
EZK.39.10	So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord 
EZK.39.11	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamon–gog.
EZK.39.12	And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land.
EZK.39.13	Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord 
EZK.39.14	And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.
EZK.39.15	And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon–gog.
EZK.39.16	And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
EZK.39.17	And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.39.18	Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
EZK.39.19	And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
EZK.39.20	Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord 
EZK.39.21	And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.
EZK.39.22	So the house of Israel shall know that I am the 
EZK.39.23	And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.
EZK.39.24	According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.
EZK.39.25	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.39.26	After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.
EZK.39.27	When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;
EZK.39.28	Then shall they know that I am the 
EZK.39.29	Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord 
EZK.40.1	In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the 
EZK.40.2	In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.
EZK.40.3	And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
EZK.40.4	And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.
EZK.40.5	And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
EZK.40.6	Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.
EZK.40.7	And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.
EZK.40.8	He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
EZK.40.9	Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.
EZK.40.10	And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
EZK.40.11	And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
EZK.40.12	The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
EZK.40.13	He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door.
EZK.40.14	He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.
EZK.40.15	And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.
EZK.40.16	And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm trees.
EZK.40.17	Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.
EZK.40.18	And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement.
EZK.40.19	Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.
EZK.40.20	And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.
EZK.40.21	And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
EZK.40.22	And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.
EZK.40.23	And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.
EZK.40.24	After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.
EZK.40.25	And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
EZK.40.26	And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.
EZK.40.27	And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.
EZK.40.28	And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;
EZK.40.29	And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
EZK.40.30	And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.
EZK.40.31	And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.
EZK.40.32	And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.
EZK.40.33	And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, were according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
EZK.40.34	And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.
EZK.40.35	And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to these measures;
EZK.40.36	The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
EZK.40.37	And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.
EZK.40.38	And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.
EZK.40.39	And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.
EZK.40.40	And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.
EZK.40.41	Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.
EZK.40.42	And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
EZK.40.43	And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.
EZK.40.44	And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.
EZK.40.45	And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.
EZK.40.46	And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the 
EZK.40.47	So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.
EZK.40.48	And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
EZK.40.49	The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.
EZK.41.1	Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.
EZK.41.2	And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.
EZK.41.3	Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.
EZK.41.4	So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.
EZK.41.5	After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.
EZK.41.6	And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.
EZK.41.7	And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst.
EZK.41.8	I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.
EZK.41.9	The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.
EZK.41.10	And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.
EZK.41.11	And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.
EZK.41.12	Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.
EZK.41.13	So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;
EZK.41.14	Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.
EZK.41.15	And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;
EZK.41.16	The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, ceiled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;
EZK.41.17	To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.
EZK.41.18	And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;
EZK.41.19	So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about.
EZK.41.20	From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.
EZK.41.21	The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.
EZK.41.22	The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the 
EZK.41.23	And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
EZK.41.24	And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.
EZK.41.25	And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without.
EZK.41.26	And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.
EZK.42.1	Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.
EZK.42.2	Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.
EZK.42.3	Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.
EZK.42.4	And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.
EZK.42.5	Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.
EZK.42.6	For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
EZK.42.7	And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.
EZK.42.8	For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits.
EZK.42.9	And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.
EZK.42.10	The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.
EZK.42.11	And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
EZK.42.12	And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.
EZK.42.13	Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the 
EZK.42.14	When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.
EZK.42.15	Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.
EZK.42.16	He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
EZK.42.17	He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
EZK.42.18	He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
EZK.42.19	He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
EZK.42.20	He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.
EZK.43.1	Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east:
EZK.43.2	And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.
EZK.43.3	And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.
EZK.43.4	And the glory of the 
EZK.43.5	So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the 
EZK.43.6	And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.
EZK.43.7	And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.
EZK.43.8	In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.
EZK.43.9	Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
EZK.43.10	Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.
EZK.43.11	And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.
EZK.43.12	This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
EZK.43.13	And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar.
EZK.43.14	And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit.
EZK.43.15	So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns.
EZK.43.16	And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.
EZK.43.17	And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.
EZK.43.18	And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.43.19	And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord 
EZK.43.20	And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.
EZK.43.21	Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.
EZK.43.22	And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.
EZK.43.23	When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
EZK.43.24	And thou shalt offer them before the 
EZK.43.25	Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.
EZK.43.26	Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.
EZK.43.27	And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord 
EZK.44.1	Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.
EZK.44.2	Then said the 
EZK.44.3	It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the 
EZK.44.4	Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the 
EZK.44.5	And the 
EZK.44.6	And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.44.7	In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.
EZK.44.8	And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
EZK.44.9	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.44.10	And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.
EZK.44.11	Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.
EZK.44.12	Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord 
EZK.44.13	And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
EZK.44.14	But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.
EZK.44.15	But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord 
EZK.44.16	They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.
EZK.44.17	And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.
EZK.44.18	They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.
EZK.44.19	And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.
EZK.44.20	Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.
EZK.44.21	Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.
EZK.44.22	Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.
EZK.44.23	And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
EZK.44.24	And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
EZK.44.25	And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.
EZK.44.26	And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.
EZK.44.27	And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord 
EZK.44.28	And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession.
EZK.44.29	They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.
EZK.44.30	And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.
EZK.44.31	The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.
EZK.45.1	Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the 
EZK.45.2	Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.
EZK.45.3	And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.
EZK.45.4	The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the 
EZK.45.5	And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.
EZK.45.6	And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.
EZK.45.7	And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border.
EZK.45.8	In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
EZK.45.9	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.45.10	Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.
EZK.45.11	The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.
EZK.45.12	And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.
EZK.45.13	This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley:
EZK.45.14	Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer:
EZK.45.15	And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord 
EZK.45.16	All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel.
EZK.45.17	And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.
EZK.45.18	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.45.19	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.
EZK.45.20	And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye reconcile the house.
EZK.45.21	In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
EZK.45.22	And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.
EZK.45.23	And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the 
EZK.45.24	And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.
EZK.45.25	In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil.
EZK.46.1	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.46.2	And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
EZK.46.3	Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the 
EZK.46.4	And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the 
EZK.46.5	And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
EZK.46.6	And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.
EZK.46.7	And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
EZK.46.8	And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.
EZK.46.9	But when the people of the land shall come before the 
EZK.46.10	And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.
EZK.46.11	And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
EZK.46.12	Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the 
EZK.46.13	Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the 
EZK.46.14	And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the 
EZK.46.15	Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.
EZK.46.16	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.46.17	But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.
EZK.46.18	Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.
EZK.46.19	After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.
EZK.46.20	Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.
EZK.46.21	Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.
EZK.46.22	In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure.
EZK.46.23	And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.
EZK.46.24	Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.
EZK.47.1	Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.
EZK.47.2	Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
EZK.47.3	And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.
EZK.47.4	Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins.
EZK.47.5	Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.
EZK.47.6	And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.
EZK.47.7	Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
EZK.47.8	Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.
EZK.47.9	And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.
EZK.47.10	And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from En–gedi even unto En–eglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
EZK.47.11	But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.
EZK.47.12	And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.
EZK.47.13	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.47.14	And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.
EZK.47.15	And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;
EZK.47.16	Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazar–hatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.
EZK.47.17	And the border from the sea shall be Hazar–enon, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the north side.
EZK.47.18	And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And this is the east side.
EZK.47.19	And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side southward.
EZK.47.20	The west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.
EZK.47.21	So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.
EZK.47.22	And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
EZK.47.23	And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord 
EZK.48.1	Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazar–enan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for these are his sides east and west; a portion for Dan.
EZK.48.2	And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Asher.
EZK.48.3	And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, a portion for Naphtali.
EZK.48.4	And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Manasseh.
EZK.48.5	And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Ephraim.
EZK.48.6	And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, a portion for Reuben.
EZK.48.7	And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Judah.
EZK.48.8	And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.
EZK.48.9	The oblation that ye shall offer unto the 
EZK.48.10	And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the 
EZK.48.11	It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
EZK.48.12	And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.
EZK.48.13	And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.
EZK.48.14	And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits of the land: for it is holy unto the 
EZK.48.15	And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst thereof.
EZK.48.16	And these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.
EZK.48.17	And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.
EZK.48.18	And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy portion; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city.
EZK.48.19	And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.
EZK.48.20	All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the possession of the city.
EZK.48.21	And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof.
EZK.48.22	Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince.
EZK.48.23	As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin shall have a portion.
EZK.48.24	And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, Simeon shall have a portion.
EZK.48.25	And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, Issachar a portion.
EZK.48.26	And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, Zebulun a portion.
EZK.48.27	And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, Gad a portion.
EZK.48.28	And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea.
EZK.48.29	This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, saith the Lord 
EZK.48.30	And these are the goings out of the city on the north side, four thousand and five hundred measures.
EZK.48.31	And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates northward; one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.
EZK.48.32	And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three gates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan.
EZK.48.33	And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures: and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulun.
EZK.48.34	At the west side four thousand and five hundred, with their three gates; one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of Naphtali.
EZK.48.35	It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of the city from that day shall be, The 
DAN.1.1	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
DAN.1.2	And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.
DAN.1.3	And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;
DAN.1.4	Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
DAN.1.5	And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
DAN.1.6	Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
DAN.1.7	Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed–nego.
DAN.1.8	But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
DAN.1.9	Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.
DAN.1.10	And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.
DAN.1.11	Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
DAN.1.12	Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
DAN.1.13	Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.
DAN.1.14	So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
DAN.1.15	And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.
DAN.1.16	Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.
DAN.1.17	As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
DAN.1.18	Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
DAN.1.19	And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.
DAN.1.20	And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.
DAN.1.21	And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.
DAN.2.1	And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.
DAN.2.2	Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.
DAN.2.3	And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.
DAN.2.4	Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.
DAN.2.5	The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
DAN.2.6	But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.
DAN.2.7	They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.
DAN.2.8	The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.
DAN.2.9	But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.
DAN.2.10	The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.
DAN.2.11	And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
DAN.2.12	For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
DAN.2.13	And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.
DAN.2.14	Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:
DAN.2.15	He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
DAN.2.16	Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:
DAN.2.18	That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
DAN.2.19	Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
DAN.2.20	Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:
DAN.2.21	And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:
DAN.2.22	He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.
DAN.2.23	I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.
DAN.2.24	Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.
DAN.2.25	Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.
DAN.2.26	The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;
DAN.2.28	But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;
DAN.2.29	As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.
DAN.2.30	But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.
DAN.2.31	Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.
DAN.2.32	This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,
DAN.2.33	His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
DAN.2.34	Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.
DAN.2.35	Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
DAN.2.36	This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
DAN.2.37	Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
DAN.2.38	And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.
DAN.2.39	And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
DAN.2.40	And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
DAN.2.41	And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.
DAN.2.42	And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.
DAN.2.43	And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
DAN.2.44	And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
DAN.2.45	Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
DAN.2.46	Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.
DAN.2.47	The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.
DAN.2.48	Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.
DAN.2.49	Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.
DAN.3.1	Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
DAN.3.2	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
DAN.3.3	Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
DAN.3.4	Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
DAN.3.5	That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:
DAN.3.6	And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.7	Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
DAN.3.8	Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.
DAN.3.9	They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.
DAN.3.10	Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:
DAN.3.11	And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.12	There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
DAN.3.13	Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego. Then they brought these men before the king.
DAN.3.14	Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?
DAN.3.15	Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.
DAN.3.17	If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.
DAN.3.18	But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
DAN.3.19	Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
DAN.3.20	And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.21	Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.22	Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego.
DAN.3.23	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.24	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.
DAN.3.25	He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.
DAN.3.26	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, came forth of the midst of the fire.
DAN.3.27	And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.
DAN.3.28	Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
DAN.3.29	Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.
DAN.3.30	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, in the province of Babylon.
DAN.4.1	Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.
DAN.4.2	I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.
DAN.4.3	How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.
DAN.4.4	I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:
DAN.4.5	I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
DAN.4.6	Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.
DAN.4.7	Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.
DAN.4.8	But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,
DAN.4.9	O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
DAN.4.10	Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.
DAN.4.11	The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:
DAN.4.12	The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.
DAN.4.13	I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;
DAN.4.14	He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:
DAN.4.15	Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:
DAN.4.16	Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.
DAN.4.17	This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.
DAN.4.18	This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.
DAN.4.19	Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.
DAN.4.20	The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;
DAN.4.21	Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:
DAN.4.22	It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
DAN.4.23	And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;
DAN.4.24	This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:
DAN.4.25	That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
DAN.4.26	And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.
DAN.4.27	Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.
DAN.4.28	All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
DAN.4.29	At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.
DAN.4.30	The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?
DAN.4.31	While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.
DAN.4.32	And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
DAN.4.33	The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.
DAN.4.34	And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:
DAN.4.35	And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?
DAN.4.36	At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.
DAN.4.37	Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.
DAN.5.1	Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.
DAN.5.2	Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.
DAN.5.3	Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.
DAN.5.4	They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
DAN.5.5	In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
DAN.5.6	Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.
DAN.5.7	The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
DAN.5.8	Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.
DAN.5.9	Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonished.
DAN.5.10	Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:
DAN.5.11	There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;
DAN.5.12	Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.
DAN.5.13	Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?
DAN.5.14	I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.
DAN.5.15	And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:
DAN.5.16	And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
DAN.5.18	O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:
DAN.5.19	And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.
DAN.5.20	But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:
DAN.5.21	And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.
DAN.5.22	And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;
DAN.5.23	But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:
DAN.5.24	Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.
DAN.5.25	And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
DAN.5.26	This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.
DAN.5.27	TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
DAN.5.28	PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
DAN.5.29	Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
DAN.5.30	In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
DAN.5.31	And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.
DAN.6.1	It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;
DAN.6.2	And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.
DAN.6.3	Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
DAN.6.4	Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.
DAN.6.5	Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.
DAN.6.6	Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.
DAN.6.7	All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
DAN.6.8	Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
DAN.6.9	Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.
DAN.6.10	Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.
DAN.6.11	Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
DAN.6.12	Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
DAN.6.13	Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.
DAN.6.14	Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.
DAN.6.15	Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.
DAN.6.16	Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.
DAN.6.17	And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.
DAN.6.18	Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.
DAN.6.19	Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.
DAN.6.20	And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?
DAN.6.21	Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.
DAN.6.22	My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.
DAN.6.23	Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.
DAN.6.24	And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.
DAN.6.25	Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.
DAN.6.26	I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.
DAN.6.27	He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
DAN.6.28	So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
DAN.7.1	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.
DAN.7.2	Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.
DAN.7.3	And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
DAN.7.4	The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
DAN.7.5	And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.
DAN.7.6	After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
DAN.7.7	After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
DAN.7.8	I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.
DAN.7.9	I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.
DAN.7.10	A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
DAN.7.11	I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.
DAN.7.12	As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
DAN.7.13	I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
DAN.7.14	And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
DAN.7.16	I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
DAN.7.17	These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.
DAN.7.18	But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
DAN.7.19	Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;
DAN.7.20	And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.
DAN.7.21	I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
DAN.7.22	Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
DAN.7.23	Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
DAN.7.24	And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.
DAN.7.25	And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.
DAN.7.26	But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.
DAN.7.27	And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
DAN.7.28	Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.
DAN.8.1	In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.
DAN.8.2	And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.
DAN.8.3	Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
DAN.8.4	I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
DAN.8.5	And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.
DAN.8.6	And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.
DAN.8.7	And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
DAN.8.8	Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.
DAN.8.9	And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.
DAN.8.10	And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.
DAN.8.11	Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
DAN.8.12	And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.
DAN.8.13	Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
DAN.8.14	And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
DAN.8.15	And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
DAN.8.16	And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.
DAN.8.17	So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.
DAN.8.18	Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.
DAN.8.19	And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.
DAN.8.20	The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.
DAN.8.21	And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.
DAN.8.22	Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.
DAN.8.23	And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
DAN.8.24	And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.
DAN.8.25	And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
DAN.8.26	And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.
DAN.8.27	And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.
DAN.9.1	In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;
DAN.9.2	In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the 
DAN.9.3	And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:
DAN.9.4	And I prayed unto the 
DAN.9.5	We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:
DAN.9.6	Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
DAN.9.7	O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.
DAN.9.8	O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
DAN.9.9	To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;
DAN.9.10	Neither have we obeyed the voice of the 
DAN.9.11	Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.
DAN.9.12	And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.
DAN.9.13	As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the 
DAN.9.14	Therefore hath the 
DAN.9.15	And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
DAN.9.16	O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.
DAN.9.17	Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.
DAN.9.18	O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.
DAN.9.19	O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
DAN.9.20	And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the 
DAN.9.21	Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
DAN.9.22	And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.
DAN.9.23	At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.
DAN.9.24	Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.
DAN.9.25	Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
DAN.9.26	And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.
DAN.9.27	And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.
DAN.10.1	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.
DAN.10.2	In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
DAN.10.3	I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
DAN.10.4	And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;
DAN.10.5	Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:
DAN.10.6	His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
DAN.10.7	And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.
DAN.10.8	Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.
DAN.10.9	Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.
DAN.10.10	And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.
DAN.10.11	And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.
DAN.10.12	Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.
DAN.10.13	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
DAN.10.14	Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.
DAN.10.15	And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.
DAN.10.16	And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.
DAN.10.17	For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.
DAN.10.18	Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,
DAN.10.19	And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
DAN.10.20	Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.
DAN.10.21	But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.
DAN.11.1	Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.
DAN.11.2	And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.
DAN.11.3	And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.
DAN.11.4	And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.
DAN.11.5	And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.
DAN.11.6	And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.
DAN.11.7	But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:
DAN.11.8	And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.
DAN.11.9	So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.
DAN.11.10	But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.
DAN.11.11	And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.
DAN.11.12	And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.
DAN.11.13	For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.
DAN.11.14	And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
DAN.11.15	So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.
DAN.11.16	But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.
DAN.11.17	He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.
DAN.11.18	After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.
DAN.11.19	Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.
DAN.11.20	Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.
DAN.11.21	And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
DAN.11.22	And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.
DAN.11.23	And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.
DAN.11.24	He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.
DAN.11.25	And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.
DAN.11.26	Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.
DAN.11.27	And both these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.
DAN.11.28	Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.
DAN.11.29	At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.
DAN.11.30	For the ships of Kittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.
DAN.11.31	And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.
DAN.11.32	And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.
DAN.11.33	And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.
DAN.11.34	Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.
DAN.11.35	And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.
DAN.11.36	And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.
DAN.11.37	Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.
DAN.11.38	But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.
DAN.11.39	Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.
DAN.11.40	And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.
DAN.11.41	He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
DAN.11.42	He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
DAN.11.43	But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.
DAN.11.44	But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.
DAN.11.45	And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.
DAN.12.1	And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
DAN.12.2	And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.
DAN.12.3	And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
DAN.12.4	But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.
DAN.12.5	Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.
DAN.12.6	And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?
DAN.12.7	And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.
DAN.12.8	And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?
DAN.12.9	And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.
DAN.12.10	Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.
DAN.12.11	And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.
DAN.12.12	Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.
DAN.12.13	But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.
HOS.1.1	The word of the 
HOS.1.2	The beginning of the word of the 
HOS.1.3	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.
HOS.1.4	And the 
HOS.1.5	And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
HOS.1.6	And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Lo–ruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.
HOS.1.7	But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the 
HOS.1.8	Now when she had weaned Lo–ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.
HOS.1.9	Then said God, Call his name Lo–ammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.
HOS.1.10	Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.
HOS.1.11	Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.
HOS.2.1	Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ru–hamah.
HOS.2.2	Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;
HOS.2.3	Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.
HOS.2.4	And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.
HOS.2.5	For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.
HOS.2.6	Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.
HOS.2.7	And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.
HOS.2.8	For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.
HOS.2.9	Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.
HOS.2.10	And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.
HOS.2.11	I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.
HOS.2.12	And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
HOS.2.13	And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the 
HOS.2.14	Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.
HOS.2.15	And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
HOS.2.16	And it shall be at that day, saith the 
HOS.2.17	For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.
HOS.2.18	And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.
HOS.2.19	And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.
HOS.2.20	I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the 
HOS.2.21	And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the 
HOS.2.22	And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.
HOS.2.23	And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.
HOS.3.1	Then said the 
HOS.3.2	So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:
HOS.3.3	And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.
HOS.3.4	For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:
HOS.3.5	Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the 
HOS.4.1	Hear the word of the 
HOS.4.2	By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.
HOS.4.3	Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
HOS.4.4	Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.
HOS.4.5	Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.
HOS.4.6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
HOS.4.7	As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.
HOS.4.8	They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.
HOS.4.9	And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.
HOS.4.10	For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the 
HOS.4.11	Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
HOS.4.12	My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.
HOS.4.13	They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.
HOS.4.14	I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.
HOS.4.15	Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth–aven, nor swear, The 
HOS.4.16	For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the 
HOS.4.17	Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.
HOS.4.18	Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.
HOS.4.19	The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
HOS.5.1	Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.
HOS.5.2	And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.
HOS.5.3	I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.
HOS.5.4	They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the 
HOS.5.5	And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.
HOS.5.6	They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the 
HOS.5.7	They have dealt treacherously against the 
HOS.5.8	Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Beth–aven, after thee, O Benjamin.
HOS.5.9	Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.
HOS.5.10	The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
HOS.5.11	Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.
HOS.5.12	Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
HOS.5.13	When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.
HOS.5.14	For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.
HOS.5.15	I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.
HOS.6.1	Come, and let us return unto the 
HOS.6.2	After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.
HOS.6.3	Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the 
HOS.6.4	O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.
HOS.6.5	Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.
HOS.6.6	For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
HOS.6.7	But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
HOS.6.8	Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.
HOS.6.9	And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.
HOS.6.10	I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
HOS.6.11	Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.
HOS.7.1	When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.
HOS.7.2	And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.
HOS.7.3	They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
HOS.7.4	They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.
HOS.7.5	In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
HOS.7.6	For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.
HOS.7.7	They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.
HOS.7.8	Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
HOS.7.9	Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.
HOS.7.10	And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the 
HOS.7.11	Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.
HOS.7.12	When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.
HOS.7.13	Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.
HOS.7.14	And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.
HOS.7.15	Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.
HOS.7.16	They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
HOS.8.1	Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the 
HOS.8.2	Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.
HOS.8.3	Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him.
HOS.8.4	They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.
HOS.8.5	Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?
HOS.8.6	For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
HOS.8.7	For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.
HOS.8.8	Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.
HOS.8.9	For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.
HOS.8.10	Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.
HOS.8.11	Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.
HOS.8.12	I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.
HOS.8.13	They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the 
HOS.8.14	For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
HOS.9.1	Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.
HOS.9.2	The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.
HOS.9.3	They shall not dwell in the 
HOS.9.4	They shall not offer wine offerings to the 
HOS.9.5	What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the 
HOS.9.6	For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles.
HOS.9.7	The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.
HOS.9.8	The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.
HOS.9.9	They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.
HOS.9.10	I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baal–peor, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.
HOS.9.11	As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.
HOS.9.12	Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!
HOS.9.13	Ephraim, as I saw Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.
HOS.9.14	Give them, O 
HOS.9.15	All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters.
HOS.9.16	Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.
HOS.9.17	My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
HOS.10.1	Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.
HOS.10.2	Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.
HOS.10.3	For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the 
HOS.10.4	They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.
HOS.10.5	The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth–aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.
HOS.10.6	It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.
HOS.10.7	As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.
HOS.10.8	The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.
HOS.10.9	O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.
HOS.10.10	It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.
HOS.10.11	And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.
HOS.10.12	Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the 
HOS.10.13	Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.
HOS.10.14	Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth–arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children.
HOS.10.15	So shall Beth–el do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.
HOS.11.1	When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.
HOS.11.2	As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.
HOS.11.3	I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
HOS.11.4	I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.
HOS.11.5	He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.
HOS.11.6	And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.
HOS.11.7	And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.
HOS.11.8	How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboiim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.
HOS.11.9	I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.
HOS.11.10	They shall walk after the 
HOS.11.11	They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the 
HOS.11.12	Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.
HOS.12.1	Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.
HOS.12.2	The 
HOS.12.3	He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:
HOS.12.4	Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in Beth–el, and there he spake with us;
HOS.12.5	Even the 
HOS.12.6	Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.
HOS.12.7	He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.
HOS.12.8	And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin.
HOS.12.9	And I that am the 
HOS.12.10	I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.
HOS.12.11	Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.
HOS.12.12	And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.
HOS.12.13	And by a prophet the 
HOS.12.14	Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.
HOS.13.1	When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.
HOS.13.2	And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.
HOS.13.3	Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.
HOS.13.4	Yet I am the 
HOS.13.5	I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.
HOS.13.6	According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.
HOS.13.7	Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them:
HOS.13.8	I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.
HOS.13.9	O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help.
HOS.13.10	I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?
HOS.13.11	I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath.
HOS.13.12	The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.
HOS.13.13	The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children.
HOS.13.14	I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.
HOS.13.15	Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the 
HOS.13.16	Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.
HOS.14.1	O Israel, return unto the 
HOS.14.2	Take with you words, and turn to the 
HOS.14.3	Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.
HOS.14.4	I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.
HOS.14.5	I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
HOS.14.6	His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
HOS.14.7	They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
HOS.14.8	Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.
HOS.14.9	Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the 
JOL.1.1	The word of the 
JOL.1.2	Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?
JOL.1.3	Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.
JOL.1.4	That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.
JOL.1.5	Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.
JOL.1.6	For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.
JOL.1.7	He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.
JOL.1.8	Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
JOL.1.9	The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the 
JOL.1.10	The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.
JOL.1.11	Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.
JOL.1.12	The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.
JOL.1.13	Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.
JOL.1.14	Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the 
JOL.1.15	Alas for the day! for the day of the 
JOL.1.16	Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
JOL.1.17	The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.
JOL.1.18	How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
JOL.1.19	O 
JOL.1.20	The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
JOL.2.1	Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the 
JOL.2.2	A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.
JOL.2.3	A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.
JOL.2.4	The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.
JOL.2.5	Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.
JOL.2.6	Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.
JOL.2.7	They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:
JOL.2.8	Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.
JOL.2.9	They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.
JOL.2.10	The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:
JOL.2.11	And the 
JOL.2.12	Therefore also now, saith the 
JOL.2.13	And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the 
JOL.2.14	Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the 
JOL.2.15	Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:
JOL.2.16	Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.
JOL.2.17	Let the priests, the ministers of the 
JOL.2.18	Then will the 
JOL.2.19	Yea, the 
JOL.2.20	But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.
JOL.2.21	Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the 
JOL.2.22	Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.
JOL.2.23	Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the 
JOL.2.24	And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil.
JOL.2.25	And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.
JOL.2.26	And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the 
JOL.2.27	And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the 
JOL.2.28	And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:
JOL.2.29	And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.
JOL.2.30	And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
JOL.2.31	The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the 
JOL.2.32	And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the 
JOL.3.1	For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
JOL.3.2	I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.
JOL.3.3	And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.
JOL.3.4	Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Philistia? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head;
JOL.3.5	Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things:
JOL.3.6	The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border.
JOL.3.7	Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:
JOL.3.8	And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the 
JOL.3.9	Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:
JOL.3.10	Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.
JOL.3.11	Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O 
JOL.3.12	Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.
JOL.3.13	Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great.
JOL.3.14	Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the 
JOL.3.15	The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.
JOL.3.16	The 
JOL.3.17	So shall ye know that I am the 
JOL.3.18	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the 
JOL.3.19	Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
JOL.3.20	But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
JOL.3.21	For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the 
AMO.1.1	The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
AMO.1.2	And he said, The 
AMO.1.3	Thus saith the 
AMO.1.4	But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Ben–hadad.
AMO.1.5	I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the 
AMO.1.6	Thus saith the 
AMO.1.7	But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof:
AMO.1.8	And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord 
AMO.1.9	Thus saith the 
AMO.1.10	But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, which shall devour the palaces thereof.
AMO.1.11	Thus saith the 
AMO.1.12	But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.
AMO.1.13	Thus saith the 
AMO.1.14	But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:
AMO.1.15	And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the 
AMO.2.1	Thus saith the 
AMO.2.2	But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:
AMO.2.3	And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the 
AMO.2.4	Thus saith the 
AMO.2.5	But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
AMO.2.6	Thus saith the 
AMO.2.7	That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:
AMO.2.8	And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.
AMO.2.9	Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
AMO.2.10	Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.
AMO.2.11	And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the 
AMO.2.12	But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.
AMO.2.13	Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves.
AMO.2.14	Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:
AMO.2.15	Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.
AMO.2.16	And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the 
AMO.3.1	Hear this word that the 
AMO.3.2	You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.
AMO.3.3	Can two walk together, except they be agreed?
AMO.3.4	Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?
AMO.3.5	Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?
AMO.3.6	Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the 
AMO.3.7	Surely the Lord 
AMO.3.8	The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord 
AMO.3.9	Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.
AMO.3.10	For they know not to do right, saith the 
AMO.3.11	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
AMO.3.12	Thus saith the 
AMO.3.13	Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord 
AMO.3.14	That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Beth–el: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.
AMO.3.15	And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the 
AMO.4.1	Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.
AMO.4.2	The Lord 
AMO.4.3	And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the 
AMO.4.4	Come to Beth–el, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:
AMO.4.5	And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord 
AMO.4.6	And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the 
AMO.4.7	And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.
AMO.4.8	So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the 
AMO.4.9	I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the 
AMO.4.10	I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the 
AMO.4.11	I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the 
AMO.4.12	Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
AMO.4.13	For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The 
AMO.5.1	Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel.
AMO.5.2	The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.
AMO.5.3	For thus saith the Lord 
AMO.5.4	For thus saith the 
AMO.5.5	But seek not Beth–el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer–sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth–el shall come to nought.
AMO.5.6	Seek the 
AMO.5.7	Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,
AMO.5.8	Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The 
AMO.5.9	That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.
AMO.5.10	They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.
AMO.5.11	Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.
AMO.5.12	For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.
AMO.5.13	Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.
AMO.5.14	Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the 
AMO.5.15	Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the 
AMO.5.16	Therefore the 
AMO.5.17	And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the 
AMO.5.18	Woe unto you that desire the day of the 
AMO.5.19	As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
AMO.5.20	Shall not the day of the 
AMO.5.21	I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.
AMO.5.22	Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.
AMO.5.23	Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.
AMO.5.24	But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
AMO.5.25	Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
AMO.5.26	But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.
AMO.5.27	Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the 
AMO.6.1	Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!
AMO.6.2	Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?
AMO.6.3	Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;
AMO.6.4	That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;
AMO.6.5	That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;
AMO.6.6	That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.
AMO.6.7	Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.
AMO.6.8	The Lord 
AMO.6.9	And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.
AMO.6.10	And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the 
AMO.6.11	For, behold, the 
AMO.6.12	Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:
AMO.6.13	Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?
AMO.6.14	But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the 
AMO.7.1	Thus hath the Lord 
AMO.7.2	And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord 
AMO.7.3	The 
AMO.7.4	Thus hath the Lord 
AMO.7.5	Then said I, O Lord 
AMO.7.6	The 
AMO.7.7	Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.
AMO.7.8	And the 
AMO.7.9	And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
AMO.7.10	Then Amaziah the priest of Beth–el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.
AMO.7.11	For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
AMO.7.12	Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:
AMO.7.13	But prophesy not again any more at Beth–el: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court.
AMO.7.14	Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:
AMO.7.15	And the 
AMO.7.16	Now therefore hear thou the word of the 
AMO.7.17	Therefore thus saith the 
AMO.8.1	Thus hath the Lord 
AMO.8.2	And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the 
AMO.8.3	And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord 
AMO.8.4	Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,
AMO.8.5	Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?
AMO.8.6	That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?
AMO.8.7	The 
AMO.8.8	Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.
AMO.8.9	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord 
AMO.8.10	And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.
AMO.8.11	Behold, the days come, saith the Lord 
AMO.8.12	And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the 
AMO.8.13	In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.
AMO.8.14	They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beer–sheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.
AMO.9.1	I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.
AMO.9.2	Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:
AMO.9.3	And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:
AMO.9.4	And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
AMO.9.5	And the Lord 
AMO.9.6	It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The 
AMO.9.7	Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the 
AMO.9.8	Behold, the eyes of the Lord 
AMO.9.9	For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.
AMO.9.10	All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.
AMO.9.11	In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:
AMO.9.12	That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the 
AMO.9.13	Behold, the days come, saith the 
AMO.9.14	And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
AMO.9.15	And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the 
OBA.1.1	The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord 
OBA.1.2	Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.
OBA.1.3	The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
OBA.1.4	Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the 
OBA.1.5	If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?
OBA.1.6	How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!
OBA.1.7	All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.
OBA.1.8	Shall I not in that day, saith the 
OBA.1.9	And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.
OBA.1.10	For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.
OBA.1.11	In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.
OBA.1.12	But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.
OBA.1.13	Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;
OBA.1.14	Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.
OBA.1.15	For the day of the 
OBA.1.16	For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.
OBA.1.17	But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
OBA.1.18	And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the 
OBA.1.19	And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.
OBA.1.20	And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.
OBA.1.21	And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the 
JON.1.1	Now the word of the 
JON.1.2	Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.
JON.1.3	But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the 
JON.1.4	But the 
JON.1.5	Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
JON.1.6	So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.
JON.1.7	And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
JON.1.8	Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?
JON.1.9	And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the 
JON.1.10	Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the 
JON.1.11	Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.
JON.1.12	And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.
JON.1.13	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.
JON.1.14	Wherefore they cried unto the 
JON.1.15	So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.
JON.1.16	Then the men feared the 
JON.1.17	Now the 
JON.2.1	Then Jonah prayed unto the 
JON.2.2	And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the 
JON.2.3	For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.
JON.2.4	Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
JON.2.5	The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.
JON.2.6	I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O 
JON.2.7	When my soul fainted within me I remembered the 
JON.2.8	They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
JON.2.9	But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the 
JON.2.10	And the 
JON.3.1	And the word of the 
JON.3.2	Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.
JON.3.3	So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the 
JON.3.4	And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
JON.3.5	So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
JON.3.6	For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
JON.3.7	And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:
JON.3.8	But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.
JON.3.9	Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?
JON.3.10	And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.
JON.4.1	But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.
JON.4.2	And he prayed unto the 
JON.4.3	Therefore now, O 
JON.4.4	Then said the 
JON.4.5	So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.
JON.4.6	And the 
JON.4.7	But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.
JON.4.8	And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.
JON.4.9	And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.
JON.4.10	Then said the 
JON.4.11	And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?
MIC.1.1	The word of the 
MIC.1.2	Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord 
MIC.1.3	For, behold, the 
MIC.1.4	And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place.
MIC.1.5	For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?
MIC.1.6	Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.
MIC.1.7	And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.
MIC.1.8	Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.
MIC.1.9	For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
MIC.1.10	Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.
MIC.1.11	Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth–ezel; he shall receive of you his standing.
MIC.1.12	For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the 
MIC.1.13	O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
MIC.1.14	Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth–gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.
MIC.1.15	Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.
MIC.1.16	Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.
MIC.2.1	Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.
MIC.2.2	And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
MIC.2.3	Therefore thus saith the 
MIC.2.4	In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.
MIC.2.5	Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the 
MIC.2.6	Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.
MIC.2.7	O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the 
MIC.2.8	Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.
MIC.2.9	The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.
MIC.2.10	Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.
MIC.2.11	If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.
MIC.2.12	I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.
MIC.2.13	The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the 
MIC.3.1	And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?
MIC.3.2	Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
MIC.3.3	Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
MIC.3.4	Then shall they cry unto the 
MIC.3.5	Thus saith the 
MIC.3.6	Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.
MIC.3.7	Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.
MIC.3.8	But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the 
MIC.3.9	Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.
MIC.3.10	They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
MIC.3.11	The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the 
MIC.3.12	Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.
MIC.4.1	But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the 
MIC.4.2	And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the 
MIC.4.3	And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
MIC.4.4	But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the 
MIC.4.5	For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the 
MIC.4.6	In that day, saith the 
MIC.4.7	And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the 
MIC.4.8	And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.
MIC.4.9	Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.
MIC.4.10	Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the 
MIC.4.11	Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.
MIC.4.12	But they know not the thoughts of the 
MIC.4.13	Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the 
MIC.5.1	Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
MIC.5.2	But thou, Beth–lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.
MIC.5.3	Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.
MIC.5.4	And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the 
MIC.5.5	And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.
MIC.5.6	And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.
MIC.5.7	And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the 
MIC.5.8	And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.
MIC.5.9	Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.
MIC.5.10	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the 
MIC.5.11	And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:
MIC.5.12	And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers:
MIC.5.13	Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.
MIC.5.14	And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.
MIC.5.15	And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.
MIC.6.1	Hear ye now what the 
MIC.6.2	Hear ye, O mountains, the 
MIC.6.3	O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.
MIC.6.4	For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
MIC.6.5	O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the 
MIC.6.6	Wherewith shall I come before the 
MIC.6.7	Will the 
MIC.6.8	He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the 
MIC.6.9	The 
MIC.6.10	Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?
MIC.6.11	Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?
MIC.6.12	For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
MIC.6.13	Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making thee desolate because of thy sins.
MIC.6.14	Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.
MIC.6.15	Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.
MIC.6.16	For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
MIC.7.1	Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.
MIC.7.2	The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.
MIC.7.3	That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.
MIC.7.4	The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.
MIC.7.5	Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.
MIC.7.6	For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.
MIC.7.7	Therefore I will look unto the 
MIC.7.8	Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the 
MIC.7.9	I will bear the indignation of the 
MIC.7.10	Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the 
MIC.7.11	In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the decree be far removed.
MIC.7.12	In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.
MIC.7.13	Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.
MIC.7.14	Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
MIC.7.15	According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things.
MIC.7.16	The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.
MIC.7.17	They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the 
MIC.7.18	Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.
MIC.7.19	He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
MIC.7.20	Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.
NAM.1.1	The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
NAM.1.2	God is jealous, and the 
NAM.1.3	The 
NAM.1.4	He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.
NAM.1.5	The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.
NAM.1.6	Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.
NAM.1.7	The 
NAM.1.8	But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.
NAM.1.9	What do ye imagine against the 
NAM.1.10	For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.
NAM.1.11	There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the 
NAM.1.12	Thus saith the 
NAM.1.13	For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.
NAM.1.14	And the 
NAM.1.15	Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.
NAM.2.1	He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.
NAM.2.2	For the 
NAM.2.3	The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.
NAM.2.4	The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.
NAM.2.5	He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.
NAM.2.6	The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.
NAM.2.7	And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.
NAM.2.8	But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back.
NAM.2.9	Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture.
NAM.2.10	She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.
NAM.2.11	Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?
NAM.2.12	The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.
NAM.2.13	Behold, I am against thee, saith the 
NAM.3.1	Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departeth not;
NAM.3.2	The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots.
NAM.3.3	The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:
NAM.3.4	Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.
NAM.3.5	Behold, I am against thee, saith the 
NAM.3.6	And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.
NAM.3.7	And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?
NAM.3.8	Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?
NAM.3.9	Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Libya were thy helpers.
NAM.3.10	Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.
NAM.3.11	Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.
NAM.3.12	All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.
NAM.3.13	Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars.
NAM.3.14	Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the mortar, make strong the brickkiln.
NAM.3.15	There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.
NAM.3.16	Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away.
NAM.3.17	Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.
NAM.3.18	Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth them.
NAM.3.19	There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
HAB.1.1	The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
HAB.1.2	O 
HAB.1.3	Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.
HAB.1.4	Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.
HAB.1.5	Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you.
HAB.1.6	For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs.
HAB.1.7	They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.
HAB.1.8	Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.
HAB.1.9	They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.
HAB.1.10	And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.
HAB.1.11	Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.
HAB.1.12	Art thou not from everlasting, O 
HAB.1.13	Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?
HAB.1.14	And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?
HAB.1.15	They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.
HAB.1.16	Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.
HAB.1.17	Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?
HAB.2.1	I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.
HAB.2.2	And the 
HAB.2.3	For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.
HAB.2.4	Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.
HAB.2.5	Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:
HAB.2.6	Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!
HAB.2.7	Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?
HAB.2.8	Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
HAB.2.9	Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!
HAB.2.10	Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned against thy soul.
HAB.2.11	For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
HAB.2.12	Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!
HAB.2.13	Behold, is it not of the 
HAB.2.14	For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the 
HAB.2.15	Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!
HAB.2.16	Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the 
HAB.2.17	For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
HAB.2.18	What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?
HAB.2.19	Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.
HAB.2.20	But the 
HAB.3.1	A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.
HAB.3.2	O 
HAB.3.3	God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.
HAB.3.4	And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.
HAB.3.5	Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.
HAB.3.6	He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.
HAB.3.7	I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
HAB.3.8	Was the 
HAB.3.9	Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
HAB.3.10	The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.
HAB.3.11	The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.
HAB.3.12	Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.
HAB.3.13	Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.
HAB.3.14	Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.
HAB.3.15	Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the heap of great waters.
HAB.3.16	When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.
HAB.3.17	Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:
HAB.3.18	Yet I will rejoice in the 
HAB.3.19	The 
ZEP.1.1	The word of the 
ZEP.1.2	I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the 
ZEP.1.3	I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the 
ZEP.1.4	I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;
ZEP.1.5	And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the 
ZEP.1.6	And them that are turned back from the 
ZEP.1.7	Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord 
ZEP.1.8	And it shall come to pass in the day of the 
ZEP.1.9	In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.
ZEP.1.10	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the 
ZEP.1.11	Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.
ZEP.1.12	And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The 
ZEP.1.13	Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.
ZEP.1.14	The great day of the 
ZEP.1.15	That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
ZEP.1.16	A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.
ZEP.1.17	And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the 
ZEP.1.18	Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the 
ZEP.2.1	Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired;
ZEP.2.2	Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the 
ZEP.2.3	Seek ye the 
ZEP.2.4	For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.
ZEP.2.5	Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the 
ZEP.2.6	And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.
ZEP.2.7	And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the 
ZEP.2.8	I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.
ZEP.2.9	Therefore as I live, saith the 
ZEP.2.10	This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the 
ZEP.2.11	The 
ZEP.2.12	Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.
ZEP.2.13	And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a wilderness.
ZEP.2.14	And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work.
ZEP.2.15	This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.
ZEP.3.1	Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!
ZEP.3.2	She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the 
ZEP.3.3	Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.
ZEP.3.4	Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.
ZEP.3.5	The just 
ZEP.3.6	I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.
ZEP.3.7	I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.
ZEP.3.8	Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the 
ZEP.3.9	For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the 
ZEP.3.10	From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.
ZEP.3.11	In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.
ZEP.3.12	I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the 
ZEP.3.13	The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
ZEP.3.14	Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
ZEP.3.15	The 
ZEP.3.16	In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.
ZEP.3.17	The 
ZEP.3.18	I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.
ZEP.3.19	Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.
ZEP.3.20	At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the 
HAG.1.1	In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the 
HAG.1.2	Thus speaketh the 
HAG.1.3	Then came the word of the 
HAG.1.4	Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this house lie waste?
HAG.1.5	Now therefore thus saith the 
HAG.1.6	Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.
HAG.1.7	Thus saith the 
HAG.1.8	Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the 
HAG.1.9	Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the 
HAG.1.10	Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.
HAG.1.11	And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.
HAG.1.12	Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the 
HAG.1.13	Then spake Haggai the 
HAG.1.14	And the 
HAG.1.15	In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.
HAG.2.1	In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the 
HAG.2.2	Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,
HAG.2.3	Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?
HAG.2.4	Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the 
HAG.2.5	According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.
HAG.2.6	For thus saith the 
HAG.2.7	And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the 
HAG.2.8	The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the 
HAG.2.9	The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the 
HAG.2.10	In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the 
HAG.2.11	Thus saith the 
HAG.2.12	If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
HAG.2.13	Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
HAG.2.14	Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the 
HAG.2.15	And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the 
HAG.2.16	Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.
HAG.2.17	I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the 
HAG.2.18	Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the 
HAG.2.19	Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.
HAG.2.20	And again the word of the 
HAG.2.21	Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;
HAG.2.22	And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.
HAG.2.23	In that day, saith the 
ZEC.1.1	In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the 
ZEC.1.2	The 
ZEC.1.3	Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the 
ZEC.1.4	Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the 
ZEC.1.5	Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?
ZEC.1.6	But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the 
ZEC.1.7	Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the 
ZEC.1.8	I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.
ZEC.1.9	Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.
ZEC.1.10	And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the 
ZEC.1.11	And they answered the angel of the 
ZEC.1.12	Then the angel of the 
ZEC.1.13	And the 
ZEC.1.14	So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the 
ZEC.1.15	And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.
ZEC.1.16	Therefore thus saith the 
ZEC.1.17	Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the 
ZEC.1.18	Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.
ZEC.1.19	And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
ZEC.1.20	And the 
ZEC.1.21	Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.
ZEC.2.1	I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.
ZEC.2.2	Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.
ZEC.2.3	And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,
ZEC.2.4	And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:
ZEC.2.5	For I, saith the 
ZEC.2.6	Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the 
ZEC.2.7	Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.
ZEC.2.8	For thus saith the 
ZEC.2.9	For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the 
ZEC.2.10	Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the 
ZEC.2.11	And many nations shall be joined to the 
ZEC.2.12	And the 
ZEC.2.13	Be silent, O all flesh, before the 
ZEC.3.1	And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the 
ZEC.3.2	And the 
ZEC.3.3	Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.
ZEC.3.4	And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.
ZEC.3.5	And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the 
ZEC.3.6	And the angel of the 
ZEC.3.7	Thus saith the 
ZEC.3.8	Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.
ZEC.3.9	For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the 
ZEC.3.10	In that day, saith the 
ZEC.4.1	And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,
ZEC.4.2	And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:
ZEC.4.3	And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.
ZEC.4.4	So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
ZEC.4.5	Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.
ZEC.4.6	Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the 
ZEC.4.7	Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.
ZEC.4.8	Moreover the word of the 
ZEC.4.9	The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the 
ZEC.4.10	For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the 
ZEC.4.11	Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?
ZEC.4.12	And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?
ZEC.4.13	And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.
ZEC.4.14	Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
ZEC.5.1	Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.
ZEC.5.2	And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.
ZEC.5.3	Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.
ZEC.5.4	I will bring it forth, saith the 
ZEC.5.5	Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.
ZEC.5.6	And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the earth.
ZEC.5.7	And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.
ZEC.5.8	And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.
ZEC.5.9	Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.
ZEC.5.10	Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?
ZEC.5.11	And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.
ZEC.6.1	And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.
ZEC.6.2	In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;
ZEC.6.3	And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.
ZEC.6.4	Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?
ZEC.6.5	And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
ZEC.6.6	The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.
ZEC.6.7	And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.
ZEC.6.8	Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.
ZEC.6.9	And the word of the 
ZEC.6.10	Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;
ZEC.6.11	Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;
ZEC.6.12	And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the 
ZEC.6.13	Even he shall build the temple of the 
ZEC.6.14	And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the 
ZEC.6.15	And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the 
ZEC.7.1	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the 
ZEC.7.2	When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem–melech, and their men, to pray before the 
ZEC.7.3	And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the 
ZEC.7.4	Then came the word of the 
ZEC.7.5	Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?
ZEC.7.6	And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?
ZEC.7.7	Should ye not hear the words which the 
ZEC.7.8	And the word of the 
ZEC.7.9	Thus speaketh the 
ZEC.7.10	And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.
ZEC.7.11	But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.
ZEC.7.12	Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the 
ZEC.7.13	Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the 
ZEC.7.14	But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.
ZEC.8.1	Again the word of the 
ZEC.8.2	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.3	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.4	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.5	And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.
ZEC.8.6	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.7	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.8	And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
ZEC.8.9	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.10	For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour.
ZEC.8.11	But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the 
ZEC.8.12	For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.
ZEC.8.13	And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.
ZEC.8.14	For thus saith the 
ZEC.8.15	So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.
ZEC.8.16	These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:
ZEC.8.17	And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the 
ZEC.8.18	And the word of the 
ZEC.8.19	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.20	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.21	And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the 
ZEC.8.22	Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the 
ZEC.8.23	Thus saith the 
ZEC.9.1	The burden of the word of the 
ZEC.9.2	And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyre, and Zidon, though it be very wise.
ZEC.9.3	And Tyre did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.
ZEC.9.4	Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.
ZEC.9.5	Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
ZEC.9.6	And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
ZEC.9.7	And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.
ZEC.9.8	And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.
ZEC.9.9	Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.
ZEC.9.10	And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.
ZEC.9.11	As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.
ZEC.9.12	Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee;
ZEC.9.13	When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.
ZEC.9.14	And the 
ZEC.9.15	The 
ZEC.9.16	And the 
ZEC.9.17	For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.
ZEC.10.1	Ask ye of the 
ZEC.10.2	For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd.
ZEC.10.3	Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the 
ZEC.10.4	Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.
ZEC.10.5	And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the 
ZEC.10.6	And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the 
ZEC.10.7	And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the 
ZEC.10.8	I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.
ZEC.10.9	And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.
ZEC.10.11	And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.
ZEC.10.12	And I will strengthen them in the 
ZEC.11.1	Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.
ZEC.11.2	Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.
ZEC.11.3	There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.
ZEC.11.4	Thus saith the 
ZEC.11.5	Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the 
ZEC.11.6	For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the 
ZEC.11.7	And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.
ZEC.11.8	Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.
ZEC.11.9	Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.
ZEC.11.10	And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.
ZEC.11.11	And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the 
ZEC.11.12	And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.
ZEC.11.13	And the 
ZEC.11.14	Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
ZEC.11.15	And the 
ZEC.11.16	For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.
ZEC.11.17	Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
ZEC.12.1	The burden of the word of the 
ZEC.12.2	Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.
ZEC.12.3	And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.
ZEC.12.4	In that day, saith the 
ZEC.12.5	And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the 
ZEC.12.6	In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem.
ZEC.12.7	The 
ZEC.12.8	In that day shall the 
ZEC.12.9	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
ZEC.12.10	And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.
ZEC.12.11	In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddo.
ZEC.12.12	And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;
ZEC.12.13	The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;
ZEC.12.14	All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.
ZEC.13.1	In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.
ZEC.13.2	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the 
ZEC.13.3	And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the 
ZEC.13.4	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:
ZEC.13.5	But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.
ZEC.13.6	And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.
ZEC.13.7	Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the 
ZEC.13.8	And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the 
ZEC.13.9	And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The 
ZEC.14.1	Behold, the day of the 
ZEC.14.2	For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
ZEC.14.3	Then shall the 
ZEC.14.4	And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.
ZEC.14.5	And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the 
ZEC.14.6	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:
ZEC.14.7	But it shall be one day which shall be known to the 
ZEC.14.8	And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.
ZEC.14.9	And the 
ZEC.14.10	All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king's winepresses.
ZEC.14.11	And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.
ZEC.14.12	And this shall be the plague wherewith the 
ZEC.14.13	And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the 
ZEC.14.14	And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.
ZEC.14.15	And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.
ZEC.14.16	And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.17	And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.18	And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the 
ZEC.14.19	This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
ZEC.14.20	In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE 
ZEC.14.21	Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the 
MAL.1.1	The burden of the word of the 
MAL.1.2	I have loved you, saith the 
MAL.1.3	And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.
MAL.1.4	Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the 
MAL.1.5	And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The 
MAL.1.6	A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the 
MAL.1.7	Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the 
MAL.1.8	And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the 
MAL.1.9	And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the 
MAL.1.10	Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the 
MAL.1.11	For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the 
MAL.1.12	But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the 
MAL.1.13	Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the 
MAL.1.14	But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the 
MAL.2.1	And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.
MAL.2.2	If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the 
MAL.2.3	Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it.
MAL.2.4	And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the 
MAL.2.5	My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.
MAL.2.6	The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.
MAL.2.7	For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the 
MAL.2.8	But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the 
MAL.2.9	Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.
MAL.2.10	Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?
MAL.2.11	Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the 
MAL.2.12	The 
MAL.2.13	And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the 
MAL.2.14	Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the 
MAL.2.15	And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
MAL.2.16	For the 
MAL.2.17	Ye have wearied the 
MAL.3.1	Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the 
MAL.3.2	But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:
MAL.3.3	And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the 
MAL.3.4	Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the 
MAL.3.5	And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the 
MAL.3.6	For I am the 
MAL.3.7	Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the 
MAL.3.8	Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
MAL.3.9	Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.
MAL.3.10	Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the 
MAL.3.11	And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the 
MAL.3.12	And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the 
MAL.3.13	Your words have been stout against me, saith the 
MAL.3.14	Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the 
MAL.3.15	And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.
MAL.3.16	Then they that feared the 
MAL.3.17	And they shall be mine, saith the 
MAL.3.18	Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.
MAL.4.1	For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the 
MAL.4.2	But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.
MAL.4.3	And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the 
MAL.4.4	Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments.
MAL.4.5	Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the 
MAL.4.6	And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
MAT.1.1	The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
MAT.1.2	Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;
MAT.1.3	And Judah begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
MAT.1.4	And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
MAT.1.5	And Salmon begat Booz of Rahab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
MAT.1.6	And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;
MAT.1.7	And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
MAT.1.8	And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
MAT.1.9	And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
MAT.1.10	And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
MAT.1.11	And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:
MAT.1.12	And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
MAT.1.13	And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
MAT.1.14	And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
MAT.1.15	And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
MAT.1.16	And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
MAT.1.17	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.
MAT.1.18	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
MAT.1.19	Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.
MAT.1.20	But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
MAT.1.21	And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
MAT.1.22	Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
MAT.1.23	Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
MAT.1.24	Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:
MAT.1.25	And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
MAT.2.1	Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,
MAT.2.2	Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
MAT.2.3	When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
MAT.2.4	And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.
MAT.2.5	And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,
MAT.2.6	And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.
MAT.2.7	Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.
MAT.2.8	And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.
MAT.2.9	When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
MAT.2.10	When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
MAT.2.11	And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
MAT.2.12	And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
MAT.2.13	And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
MAT.2.14	When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:
MAT.2.15	And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
MAT.2.16	Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.
MAT.2.17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
MAT.2.18	In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.
MAT.2.19	But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
MAT.2.20	Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.
MAT.2.21	And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
MAT.2.22	But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:
MAT.2.23	And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.
MAT.3.1	In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,
MAT.3.2	And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
MAT.3.3	For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
MAT.3.4	And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.
MAT.3.5	Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,
MAT.3.6	And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
MAT.3.7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
MAT.3.8	Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:
MAT.3.9	And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
MAT.3.10	And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
MAT.3.11	I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:
MAT.3.12	Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
MAT.3.13	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.
MAT.3.14	But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
MAT.3.15	And Jesus answering said unto him, 
MAT.3.16	And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:
MAT.3.17	And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
MAT.4.1	Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
MAT.4.2	And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.
MAT.4.3	And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
MAT.4.4	But he answered and said, 
MAT.4.5	Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,
MAT.4.6	And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
MAT.4.7	Jesus said unto him, 
MAT.4.8	Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
MAT.4.9	And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
MAT.4.10	Then saith Jesus unto him, 
MAT.4.11	Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
MAT.4.12	Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;
MAT.4.13	And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
MAT.4.14	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
MAT.4.15	The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
MAT.4.16	The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.
MAT.4.17	From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, 
MAT.4.18	And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
MAT.4.19	And he saith unto them, 
MAT.4.20	And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.
MAT.4.21	And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
MAT.4.22	And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.
MAT.4.23	And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.
MAT.4.24	And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.
MAT.4.25	And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.
MAT.5.1	And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:
MAT.5.2	And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
MAT.7.28	And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:
MAT.7.29	For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
MAT.8.1	When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
MAT.8.2	And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
MAT.8.3	And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, 
MAT.8.4	And Jesus saith unto him, 
MAT.8.5	And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,
MAT.8.6	And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
MAT.8.7	And Jesus saith unto him, 
MAT.8.8	The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.
MAT.8.9	For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
MAT.8.10	When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, 
MAT.8.13	And Jesus said unto the centurion, 
MAT.8.14	And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.
MAT.8.15	And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.
MAT.8.16	When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:
MAT.8.17	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.
MAT.8.18	Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.
MAT.8.19	And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
MAT.8.20	And Jesus saith unto him, 
MAT.8.21	And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
MAT.8.22	But Jesus said unto him, 
MAT.8.23	And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.
MAT.8.24	And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.
MAT.8.25	And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.
MAT.8.26	And he saith unto them, 
MAT.8.27	But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
MAT.8.28	And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.
MAT.8.29	And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
MAT.8.30	And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.
MAT.8.31	So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.
MAT.8.32	And he said unto them, 
MAT.8.33	And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.
MAT.8.34	And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.
MAT.9.1	And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.
MAT.9.2	And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; 
MAT.9.3	And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.
MAT.9.4	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, 
MAT.9.7	And he arose, and departed to his house.
MAT.9.8	But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.
MAT.9.9	And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, 
MAT.9.10	And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.
MAT.9.11	And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?
MAT.9.12	But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, 
MAT.9.14	Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?
MAT.9.15	And Jesus said unto them, 
MAT.9.18	While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
MAT.9.19	And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.
MAT.9.20	And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:
MAT.9.21	For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.
MAT.9.22	But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, 
MAT.9.23	And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,
MAT.9.24	He said unto them, 
MAT.9.25	But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.
MAT.9.26	And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.
MAT.9.27	And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou Son of David, have mercy on us.
MAT.9.28	And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, 
MAT.9.29	Then touched he their eyes, saying, 
MAT.9.30	And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, 
MAT.9.31	But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.
MAT.9.32	As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.
MAT.9.33	And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.
MAT.9.35	And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
MAT.9.36	But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
MAT.9.37	Then saith he unto his disciples, 
MAT.10.1	And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
MAT.10.2	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
MAT.10.3	Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
MAT.10.4	Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
MAT.10.5	These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, 
MAT.11.1	And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.
MAT.11.2	Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
MAT.11.3	And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?
MAT.11.4	Jesus answered and said unto them, 
MAT.11.7	And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, 
MAT.11.20	Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:
MAT.11.25	At that time Jesus answered and said, 
MAT.12.1	At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.
MAT.12.2	But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.
MAT.12.3	But he said unto them, 
MAT.12.9	And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:
MAT.12.10	And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.
MAT.12.11	And he said unto them, 
MAT.12.13	Then saith he to the man, 
MAT.12.14	Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.
MAT.12.15	But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;
MAT.12.16	And charged them that they should not make him known:
MAT.12.17	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
MAT.12.18	Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.
MAT.12.19	He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.
MAT.12.20	A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.
MAT.12.21	And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
MAT.12.22	Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.
MAT.12.23	And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?
MAT.12.24	But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.
MAT.12.25	And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, 
MAT.12.38	Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.
MAT.12.39	But he answered and said unto them, 
MAT.12.46	While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.
MAT.12.47	Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.
MAT.12.48	But he answered and said unto him that told him, 
MAT.12.49	And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, 
MAT.13.1	The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
MAT.13.2	And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
MAT.13.3	And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, 
MAT.13.10	And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
MAT.13.11	He answered and said unto them, 
MAT.13.24	Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, 
MAT.13.31	Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, 
MAT.13.33	Another parable spake he unto them; 
MAT.13.34	All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:
MAT.13.35	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
MAT.13.36	Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
MAT.13.37	He answered and said unto them, 
MAT.13.51	Jesus saith unto them, 
MAT.13.52	Then said he unto them, 
MAT.13.53	And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
MAT.13.54	And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
MAT.13.55	Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
MAT.13.56	And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?
MAT.13.57	And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, 
MAT.13.58	And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
MAT.14.1	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
MAT.14.2	And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
MAT.14.3	For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.
MAT.14.4	For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
MAT.14.5	And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
MAT.14.6	But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.
MAT.14.7	Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.
MAT.14.8	And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.
MAT.14.9	And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.
MAT.14.10	And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
MAT.14.11	And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.
MAT.14.12	And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
MAT.14.13	When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.
MAT.14.14	And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.
MAT.14.15	And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.
MAT.14.16	But Jesus said unto them, 
MAT.14.17	And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
MAT.14.18	He said, 
MAT.14.19	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
MAT.14.20	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
MAT.14.21	And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.
MAT.14.22	And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
MAT.14.23	And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.
MAT.14.24	But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.
MAT.14.25	And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.
MAT.14.26	And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.
MAT.14.27	But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, 
MAT.14.28	And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.
MAT.14.29	And he said, 
MAT.14.30	But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
MAT.14.31	And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, 
MAT.14.32	And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
MAT.14.33	Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
MAT.14.34	And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
MAT.14.35	And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;
MAT.14.36	And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
MAT.15.1	Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,
MAT.15.2	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
MAT.15.3	But he answered and said unto them, 
MAT.15.10	And he called the multitude, and said unto them, 
MAT.15.12	Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?
MAT.15.13	But he answered and said, 
MAT.15.15	Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.
MAT.15.16	And Jesus said, 
MAT.15.21	Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
MAT.15.22	And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
MAT.15.23	But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
MAT.15.24	But he answered and said, 
MAT.15.25	Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
MAT.15.26	But he answered and said, 
MAT.15.27	And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.
MAT.15.28	Then Jesus answered and said unto her, 
MAT.15.29	And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
MAT.15.30	And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:
MAT.15.31	Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
MAT.15.32	Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, 
MAT.15.33	And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
MAT.15.34	And Jesus saith unto them, 
MAT.15.35	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
MAT.15.36	And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
MAT.15.37	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.
MAT.15.38	And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
MAT.15.39	And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
MAT.16.1	The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.
MAT.16.2	He answered and said unto them, 
MAT.16.5	And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
MAT.16.6	Then Jesus said unto them, 
MAT.16.7	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.
MAT.16.8	Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, 
MAT.16.12	Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
MAT.16.13	When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, 
MAT.16.14	And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
MAT.16.15	He saith unto them, 
MAT.16.16	And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
MAT.16.17	And Jesus answered and said unto him, 
MAT.16.20	Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
MAT.16.21	From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
MAT.16.22	Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.
MAT.16.23	But he turned, and said unto Peter, 
MAT.16.24	Then said Jesus unto his disciples, 
MAT.17.1	And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,
MAT.17.2	And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.
MAT.17.3	And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.
MAT.17.4	Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
MAT.17.5	While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
MAT.17.6	And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
MAT.17.7	And Jesus came and touched them, and said, 
MAT.17.8	And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.
MAT.17.9	And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, 
MAT.17.10	And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?
MAT.17.11	And Jesus answered and said unto them, 
MAT.17.13	Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.
MAT.17.14	And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,
MAT.17.15	Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatic, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.
MAT.17.16	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
MAT.17.17	Then Jesus answered and said, 
MAT.17.18	And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.
MAT.17.19	Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?
MAT.17.20	And Jesus said unto them, 
MAT.17.22	And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, 
MAT.17.24	And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?
MAT.17.25	He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, 
MAT.17.26	Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, 
MAT.18.1	At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
MAT.18.2	And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,
MAT.18.3	And said, 
MAT.18.21	Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
MAT.18.22	Jesus saith unto him, 
MAT.19.1	And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;
MAT.19.2	And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
MAT.19.3	The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
MAT.19.4	And he answered and said unto them, 
MAT.19.7	They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?
MAT.19.8	He saith unto them, 
MAT.19.10	His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.
MAT.19.11	But he said unto them, 
MAT.19.13	Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.
MAT.19.14	But Jesus said, 
MAT.19.15	And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.
MAT.19.16	And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
MAT.19.17	And he said unto him, 
MAT.19.18	He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, 
MAT.19.20	The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?
MAT.19.21	Jesus said unto him, 
MAT.19.22	But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
MAT.19.23	Then said Jesus unto his disciples, 
MAT.19.25	When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
MAT.19.26	But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, 
MAT.19.27	Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?
MAT.19.28	And Jesus said unto them, 
MAT.20.17	And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,
MAT.20.20	Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.
MAT.20.21	And he said unto her, 
MAT.20.22	But Jesus answered and said, 
MAT.20.23	And he saith unto them, 
MAT.20.24	And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
MAT.20.25	But Jesus called them unto him, and said, 
MAT.20.29	And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
MAT.20.30	And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David.
MAT.20.31	And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David.
MAT.20.32	And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, 
MAT.20.33	They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
MAT.20.34	So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
MAT.21.1	And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,
MAT.21.2	Saying unto them, 
MAT.21.4	All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
MAT.21.5	Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.
MAT.21.6	And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,
MAT.21.7	And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.
MAT.21.8	And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.
MAT.21.9	And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
MAT.21.10	And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
MAT.21.11	And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
MAT.21.12	And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
MAT.21.13	And said unto them, 
MAT.21.14	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
MAT.21.15	And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased,
MAT.21.16	And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, 
MAT.21.17	And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.
MAT.21.18	Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
MAT.21.19	And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, 
MAT.21.20	And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!
MAT.21.21	Jesus answered and said unto them, 
MAT.21.23	And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
MAT.21.24	And Jesus answered and said unto them, 
MAT.21.26	But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.
MAT.21.27	And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, 
MAT.21.41	They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
MAT.21.42	Jesus saith unto them, 
MAT.21.45	And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
MAT.21.46	But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
MAT.22.1	And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,
MAT.22.15	Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.
MAT.22.16	And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.
MAT.22.17	Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
MAT.22.18	But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, 
MAT.22.20	And he saith unto them, 
MAT.22.21	They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, 
MAT.22.22	When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.
MAT.22.23	The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
MAT.22.24	Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
MAT.22.25	Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:
MAT.22.26	Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
MAT.22.27	And last of all the woman died also.
MAT.22.28	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
MAT.22.29	Jesus answered and said unto them, 
MAT.22.33	And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.
MAT.22.34	But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.
MAT.22.35	Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,
MAT.22.36	Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
MAT.22.37	Jesus said unto him, 
MAT.22.41	While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
MAT.22.42	Saying, 
MAT.22.43	He saith unto them, 
MAT.22.46	And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
MAT.23.1	Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
MAT.23.2	Saying, 
MAT.24.1	And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.
MAT.24.2	And Jesus said unto them, 
MAT.24.3	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
MAT.24.4	And Jesus answered and said unto them, 
MAT.26.1	And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,
MAT.26.3	Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
MAT.26.4	And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.
MAT.26.5	But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.
MAT.26.6	Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
MAT.26.7	There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.
MAT.26.8	But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?
MAT.26.9	For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
MAT.26.10	When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, 
MAT.26.14	Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,
MAT.26.15	And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
MAT.26.16	And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
MAT.26.17	Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
MAT.26.18	And he said, 
MAT.26.19	And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
MAT.26.20	Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.
MAT.26.21	And as they did eat, he said, 
MAT.26.22	And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?
MAT.26.23	And he answered and said, 
MAT.26.25	Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, 
MAT.26.26	And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, 
MAT.26.27	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, 
MAT.26.30	And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
MAT.26.31	Then saith Jesus unto them, 
MAT.26.33	Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.
MAT.26.34	Jesus said unto him, 
MAT.26.35	Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
MAT.26.36	Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, 
MAT.26.37	And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
MAT.26.38	Then saith he unto them, 
MAT.26.39	And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, 
MAT.26.40	And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, 
MAT.26.42	He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, 
MAT.26.43	And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
MAT.26.44	And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
MAT.26.45	Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, 
MAT.26.47	And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
MAT.26.48	Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
MAT.26.49	And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
MAT.26.50	And Jesus said unto him, 
MAT.26.51	And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.
MAT.26.52	Then said Jesus unto him, 
MAT.26.55	In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, 
MAT.26.57	And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
MAT.26.58	But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.
MAT.26.59	Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;
MAT.26.60	But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
MAT.26.61	And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
MAT.26.62	And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
MAT.26.63	But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
MAT.26.64	Jesus saith unto him, 
MAT.26.65	Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
MAT.26.66	What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
MAT.26.67	Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,
MAT.26.68	Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?
MAT.26.69	Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
MAT.26.70	But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
MAT.26.71	And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.
MAT.26.72	And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
MAT.26.73	And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.
MAT.26.74	Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
MAT.26.75	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, 
MAT.27.1	When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
MAT.27.2	And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
MAT.27.3	Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
MAT.27.4	Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.
MAT.27.5	And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
MAT.27.6	And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.
MAT.27.7	And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.
MAT.27.8	Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.
MAT.27.9	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
MAT.27.10	And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.
MAT.27.11	And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, 
MAT.27.12	And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
MAT.27.13	Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
MAT.27.14	And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.
MAT.27.15	Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.
MAT.27.16	And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
MAT.27.17	Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?
MAT.27.18	For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
MAT.27.19	When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
MAT.27.20	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
MAT.27.21	The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.
MAT.27.22	Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.
MAT.27.23	And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
MAT.27.24	When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.
MAT.27.25	Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.
MAT.27.26	Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
MAT.27.27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.
MAT.27.28	And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
MAT.27.29	And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
MAT.27.30	And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.
MAT.27.31	And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.
MAT.27.32	And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.
MAT.27.33	And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,
MAT.27.34	They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.
MAT.27.35	And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.
MAT.27.36	And sitting down they watched him there;
MAT.27.37	And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
MAT.27.38	Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.
MAT.27.39	And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,
MAT.27.40	And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.
MAT.27.41	Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,
MAT.27.42	He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.
MAT.27.43	He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
MAT.27.44	The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.
MAT.27.45	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.
MAT.27.46	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, 
MAT.27.47	Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.
MAT.27.48	And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
MAT.27.49	The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.
MAT.27.50	Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
MAT.27.51	And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;
MAT.27.52	And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,
MAT.27.53	And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
MAT.27.54	Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
MAT.27.55	And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
MAT.27.56	Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.
MAT.27.57	When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:
MAT.27.58	He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
MAT.27.59	And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
MAT.27.60	And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.
MAT.27.61	And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
MAT.27.62	Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,
MAT.27.63	Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, 
MAT.27.64	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.
MAT.27.65	Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.
MAT.27.66	So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.
MAT.28.1	In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
MAT.28.2	And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
MAT.28.3	His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
MAT.28.4	And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.
MAT.28.5	And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
MAT.28.6	He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
MAT.28.7	And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
MAT.28.8	And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.
MAT.28.9	And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, 
MAT.28.10	Then said Jesus unto them, 
MAT.28.11	Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.
MAT.28.12	And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,
MAT.28.13	Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
MAT.28.14	And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.
MAT.28.15	So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
MAT.28.16	Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
MAT.28.17	And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
MAT.28.18	And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, 
MRK.1.1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
MRK.1.2	As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
MRK.1.3	The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
MRK.1.4	John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
MRK.1.5	And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
MRK.1.6	And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
MRK.1.7	And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
MRK.1.8	I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
MRK.1.9	And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.
MRK.1.10	And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:
MRK.1.11	And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
MRK.1.12	And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
MRK.1.13	And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.
MRK.1.14	Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
MRK.1.15	And saying, 
MRK.1.16	Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
MRK.1.17	And Jesus said unto them, 
MRK.1.18	And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
MRK.1.19	And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.
MRK.1.20	And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.
MRK.1.21	And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
MRK.1.22	And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
MRK.1.23	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
MRK.1.24	Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
MRK.1.25	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, 
MRK.1.26	And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.
MRK.1.27	And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.
MRK.1.28	And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
MRK.1.29	And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
MRK.1.30	But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.
MRK.1.31	And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
MRK.1.32	And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.
MRK.1.33	And all the city was gathered together at the door.
MRK.1.34	And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
MRK.1.35	And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
MRK.1.36	And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
MRK.1.37	And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.
MRK.1.38	And he said unto them, 
MRK.1.39	And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.
MRK.1.40	And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
MRK.1.41	And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, 
MRK.1.42	And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
MRK.1.43	And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;
MRK.1.44	And saith unto him, 
MRK.1.45	But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
MRK.2.1	And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.
MRK.2.2	And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.
MRK.2.3	And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.
MRK.2.4	And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.
MRK.2.5	When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, 
MRK.2.6	But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
MRK.2.7	Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?
MRK.2.8	And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, 
MRK.2.12	And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
MRK.2.13	And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
MRK.2.14	And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, 
MRK.2.15	And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.
MRK.2.16	And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
MRK.2.17	When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, 
MRK.2.18	And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
MRK.2.19	And Jesus said unto them, 
MRK.2.23	And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.
MRK.2.24	And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
MRK.2.25	And he said unto them, 
MRK.2.27	And he said unto them, 
MRK.3.1	And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.
MRK.3.2	And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
MRK.3.3	And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, 
MRK.3.4	And he saith unto them, 
MRK.3.5	And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, 
MRK.3.6	And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
MRK.3.7	But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,
MRK.3.8	And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.
MRK.3.9	And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
MRK.3.10	For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.
MRK.3.11	And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
MRK.3.12	And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
MRK.3.13	And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.
MRK.3.14	And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
MRK.3.15	And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:
MRK.3.16	And Simon he surnamed Peter;
MRK.3.17	And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:
MRK.3.18	And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
MRK.3.19	And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.
MRK.3.20	And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
MRK.3.21	And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
MRK.3.22	And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.
MRK.3.23	And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, 
MRK.3.30	Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
MRK.3.31	There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
MRK.3.32	And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
MRK.3.33	And he answered them, saying, 
MRK.3.34	And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, 
MRK.4.1	And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
MRK.4.2	And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,
MRK.4.9	And he said unto them, 
MRK.4.10	And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
MRK.4.11	And he said unto them, 
MRK.4.13	And he said unto them, 
MRK.4.21	And he said unto them, 
MRK.4.24	And he said unto them, 
MRK.4.26	And he said, 
MRK.4.30	And he said, 
MRK.4.33	And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.
MRK.4.34	But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
MRK.4.35	And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, 
MRK.4.36	And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.
MRK.4.37	And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
MRK.4.38	And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
MRK.4.39	And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, 
MRK.4.40	And he said unto them, 
MRK.4.41	And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
MRK.5.1	And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
MRK.5.2	And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
MRK.5.3	Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:
MRK.5.4	Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.
MRK.5.5	And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.
MRK.5.6	But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,
MRK.5.7	And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
MRK.5.8	For he said unto him, 
MRK.5.9	And he asked him, 
MRK.5.10	And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
MRK.5.11	Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
MRK.5.12	And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
MRK.5.13	And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.
MRK.5.14	And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.
MRK.5.15	And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
MRK.5.16	And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.
MRK.5.17	And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
MRK.5.18	And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.
MRK.5.19	Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, 
MRK.5.20	And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.
MRK.5.21	And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.
MRK.5.22	And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
MRK.5.23	And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.
MRK.5.24	And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.
MRK.5.25	And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
MRK.5.26	And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
MRK.5.27	When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.
MRK.5.28	For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
MRK.5.29	And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.
MRK.5.30	And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, 
MRK.5.31	And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, 
MRK.5.32	And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
MRK.5.33	But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
MRK.5.34	And he said unto her, 
MRK.5.35	While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?
MRK.5.36	As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, 
MRK.5.37	And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
MRK.5.38	And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.
MRK.5.39	And when he was come in, he saith unto them, 
MRK.5.40	And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.
MRK.5.41	And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, 
MRK.5.42	And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.
MRK.5.43	And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
MRK.6.1	And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
MRK.6.2	And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?
MRK.6.3	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.
MRK.6.4	But Jesus said unto them, 
MRK.6.5	And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.
MRK.6.6	And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.
MRK.6.7	And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;
MRK.6.8	And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:
MRK.6.9	But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.
MRK.6.10	And he said unto them, 
MRK.6.12	And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
MRK.6.13	And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.
MRK.6.14	And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
MRK.6.15	Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
MRK.6.16	But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.
MRK.6.17	For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.
MRK.6.18	For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
MRK.6.19	Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:
MRK.6.20	For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.
MRK.6.21	And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;
MRK.6.22	And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
MRK.6.23	And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
MRK.6.24	And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
MRK.6.25	And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.
MRK.6.26	And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.
MRK.6.27	And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
MRK.6.28	And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.
MRK.6.29	And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
MRK.6.30	And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
MRK.6.31	And he said unto them, 
MRK.6.32	And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
MRK.6.33	And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.
MRK.6.34	And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
MRK.6.35	And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:
MRK.6.36	Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.
MRK.6.37	He answered and said unto them, 
MRK.6.38	He saith unto them, 
MRK.6.39	And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
MRK.6.40	And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
MRK.6.41	And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.
MRK.6.42	And they did all eat, and were filled.
MRK.6.43	And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
MRK.6.44	And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
MRK.6.45	And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.
MRK.6.46	And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.
MRK.6.47	And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
MRK.6.48	And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.
MRK.6.49	But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:
MRK.6.50	For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, 
MRK.6.51	And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.
MRK.6.52	For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.
MRK.6.53	And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.
MRK.6.54	And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,
MRK.6.55	And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
MRK.6.56	And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
MRK.7.1	Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
MRK.7.2	And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.
MRK.7.3	For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
MRK.7.4	And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.
MRK.7.5	Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?
MRK.7.6	He answered and said unto them, 
MRK.7.9	And he said unto them, 
MRK.7.14	And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, 
MRK.7.17	And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
MRK.7.18	And he saith unto them, 
MRK.7.20	And he said, 
MRK.7.24	And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.
MRK.7.25	For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:
MRK.7.26	The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
MRK.7.27	But Jesus said unto her, 
MRK.7.28	And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.
MRK.7.29	And he said unto her, 
MRK.7.30	And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
MRK.7.31	And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
MRK.7.32	And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.
MRK.7.33	And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
MRK.7.34	And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, 
MRK.7.35	And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
MRK.7.36	And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;
MRK.7.37	And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
MRK.8.1	In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,
MRK.8.4	And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?
MRK.8.5	And he asked them, 
MRK.8.6	And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.
MRK.8.7	And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.
MRK.8.8	So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.
MRK.8.9	And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
MRK.8.10	And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
MRK.8.11	And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
MRK.8.12	And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, 
MRK.8.13	And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.
MRK.8.14	Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.
MRK.8.15	And he charged them, saying, 
MRK.8.16	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.
MRK.8.17	And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, 
MRK.8.21	And he said unto them, 
MRK.8.22	And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.
MRK.8.23	And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.
MRK.8.24	And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
MRK.8.25	After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.
MRK.8.26	And he sent him away to his house, saying, 
MRK.8.27	And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, 
MRK.8.28	And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
MRK.8.29	And he saith unto them, 
MRK.8.30	And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
MRK.8.31	And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
MRK.8.32	And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
MRK.8.33	But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, 
MRK.8.34	And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, 
MRK.9.1	And he said unto them, 
MRK.9.2	And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.
MRK.9.3	And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.
MRK.9.4	And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
MRK.9.5	And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
MRK.9.6	For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
MRK.9.7	And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
MRK.9.8	And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
MRK.9.9	And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.
MRK.9.10	And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
MRK.9.11	And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?
MRK.9.12	And he answered and told them, 
MRK.9.14	And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.
MRK.9.15	And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.
MRK.9.16	And he asked the scribes, 
MRK.9.17	And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;
MRK.9.18	And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.
MRK.9.19	He answereth him, and saith, 
MRK.9.20	And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
MRK.9.21	And he asked his father, 
MRK.9.22	And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.
MRK.9.23	Jesus said unto him, 
MRK.9.24	And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
MRK.9.25	When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, 
MRK.9.26	And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.
MRK.9.27	But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
MRK.9.28	And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
MRK.9.29	And he said unto them, 
MRK.9.30	And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.
MRK.9.31	For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, 
MRK.9.32	But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
MRK.9.33	And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, 
MRK.9.34	But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.
MRK.9.35	And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, 
MRK.9.36	And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,
MRK.9.38	And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.
MRK.9.39	But Jesus said, 
MRK.10.1	And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.
MRK.10.2	And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.
MRK.10.3	And he answered and said unto them, 
MRK.10.4	And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.
MRK.10.5	And Jesus answered and said unto them, 
MRK.10.10	And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.
MRK.10.11	And he saith unto them, 
MRK.10.13	And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.
MRK.10.14	But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, 
MRK.10.16	And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.
MRK.10.17	And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
MRK.10.18	And Jesus said unto him, 
MRK.10.20	And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.
MRK.10.21	Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, 
MRK.10.22	And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.
MRK.10.23	And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, 
MRK.10.24	And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, 
MRK.10.26	And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
MRK.10.27	And Jesus looking upon them saith, 
MRK.10.28	Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.
MRK.10.29	And Jesus answered and said, 
MRK.10.32	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,
MRK.10.33	Saying, 
MRK.10.35	And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.
MRK.10.36	And he said unto them, 
MRK.10.37	They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.
MRK.10.38	But Jesus said unto them, 
MRK.10.39	And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, 
MRK.10.41	And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.
MRK.10.42	But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, 
MRK.10.46	And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.
MRK.10.47	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
MRK.10.48	And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
MRK.10.49	And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.
MRK.10.50	And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
MRK.10.51	And Jesus answered and said unto him, 
MRK.10.52	And Jesus said unto him, 
MRK.11.1	And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,
MRK.11.2	And saith unto them, 
MRK.11.4	And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.
MRK.11.5	And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
MRK.11.6	And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.
MRK.11.7	And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.
MRK.11.8	And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.
MRK.11.9	And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:
MRK.11.10	Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
MRK.11.11	And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.
MRK.11.12	And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:
MRK.11.13	And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.
MRK.11.14	And Jesus answered and said unto it, 
MRK.11.15	And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;
MRK.11.16	And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.
MRK.11.17	And he taught, saying unto them, 
MRK.11.18	And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.
MRK.11.19	And when even was come, he went out of the city.
MRK.11.20	And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
MRK.11.21	And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.
MRK.11.22	And Jesus answering saith unto them, 
MRK.11.27	And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,
MRK.11.28	And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?
MRK.11.29	And Jesus answered and said unto them, 
MRK.11.31	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
MRK.11.32	But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.
MRK.11.33	And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, 
MRK.12.1	And he began to speak unto them by parables. 
MRK.12.12	And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.
MRK.12.13	And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.
MRK.12.14	And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
MRK.12.15	Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, 
MRK.12.16	And they brought it. And he saith unto them, 
MRK.12.17	And Jesus answering said unto them, 
MRK.12.18	Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
MRK.12.19	Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
MRK.12.20	Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
MRK.12.21	And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.
MRK.12.22	And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.
MRK.12.23	In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
MRK.12.24	And Jesus answering said unto them, 
MRK.12.28	And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
MRK.12.29	And Jesus answered him, 
MRK.12.32	And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:
MRK.12.33	And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
MRK.12.34	And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, 
MRK.12.35	And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, 
MRK.12.38	And he said unto them in his doctrine, 
MRK.12.41	And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
MRK.12.42	And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
MRK.12.43	And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, 
MRK.13.1	And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!
MRK.13.2	And Jesus answering said unto him, 
MRK.13.3	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
MRK.13.4	Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
MRK.13.5	And Jesus answering them began to say, 
MRK.14.1	After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.
MRK.14.2	But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.
MRK.14.3	And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.
MRK.14.4	And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?
MRK.14.5	For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
MRK.14.6	And Jesus said, 
MRK.14.10	And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.
MRK.14.11	And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.
MRK.14.12	And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?
MRK.14.13	And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, 
MRK.14.16	And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
MRK.14.17	And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
MRK.14.18	And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, 
MRK.14.19	And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?
MRK.14.20	And he answered and said unto them, 
MRK.14.22	And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, 
MRK.14.23	And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.
MRK.14.24	And he said unto them, 
MRK.14.26	And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
MRK.14.27	And Jesus saith unto them, 
MRK.14.29	But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.
MRK.14.30	And Jesus saith unto him, 
MRK.14.31	But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.
MRK.14.32	And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, 
MRK.14.33	And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;
MRK.14.34	And saith unto them, 
MRK.14.35	And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
MRK.14.36	And he said, 
MRK.14.37	And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, 
MRK.14.39	And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.
MRK.14.40	And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.
MRK.14.41	And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, 
MRK.14.43	And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
MRK.14.44	And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.
MRK.14.45	And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.
MRK.14.46	And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
MRK.14.47	And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
MRK.14.48	And Jesus answered and said unto them, 
MRK.14.50	And they all forsook him, and fled.
MRK.14.51	And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:
MRK.14.52	And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
MRK.14.53	And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
MRK.14.54	And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.
MRK.14.55	And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
MRK.14.56	For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.
MRK.14.57	And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,
MRK.14.58	We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.
MRK.14.59	But neither so did their witness agree together.
MRK.14.60	And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
MRK.14.61	But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
MRK.14.62	And Jesus said, 
MRK.14.63	Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?
MRK.14.64	Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
MRK.14.65	And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.
MRK.14.66	And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:
MRK.14.67	And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
MRK.14.68	But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
MRK.14.69	And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.
MRK.14.70	And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.
MRK.14.71	But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.
MRK.14.72	And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, 
MRK.15.1	And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.
MRK.15.2	And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, 
MRK.15.3	And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
MRK.15.4	And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.
MRK.15.5	But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
MRK.15.6	Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
MRK.15.7	And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
MRK.15.8	And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.
MRK.15.9	But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
MRK.15.10	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
MRK.15.11	But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
MRK.15.12	And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?
MRK.15.13	And they cried out again, Crucify him.
MRK.15.14	Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
MRK.15.15	And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
MRK.15.16	And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
MRK.15.17	And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,
MRK.15.18	And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
MRK.15.19	And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
MRK.15.20	And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
MRK.15.21	And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
MRK.15.22	And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
MRK.15.23	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.
MRK.15.24	And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
MRK.15.25	And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
MRK.15.26	And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
MRK.15.27	And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
MRK.15.28	And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
MRK.15.29	And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,
MRK.15.30	Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
MRK.15.31	Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
MRK.15.32	Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
MRK.15.33	And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
MRK.15.34	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, 
MRK.15.35	And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.
MRK.15.36	And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.
MRK.15.37	And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
MRK.15.38	And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
MRK.15.39	And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
MRK.15.40	There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
MRK.15.41	(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.
MRK.15.42	And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
MRK.15.43	Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
MRK.15.44	And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
MRK.15.45	And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
MRK.15.46	And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
MRK.15.47	And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.
MRK.16.1	And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.
MRK.16.2	And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.
MRK.16.3	And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
MRK.16.4	And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.
MRK.16.5	And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.
MRK.16.6	And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.
MRK.16.7	But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.
MRK.16.8	And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.
MRK.16.9	Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.
MRK.16.10	And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
MRK.16.11	And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.
MRK.16.12	After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.
MRK.16.13	And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.
MRK.16.14	Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.
MRK.16.15	And he said unto them, 
MRK.16.19	So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
MRK.16.20	And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.
LUK.1.1	Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,
LUK.1.2	Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;
LUK.1.3	It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,
LUK.1.4	That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.
LUK.1.5	There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.
LUK.1.6	And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
LUK.1.7	And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.
LUK.1.8	And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,
LUK.1.9	According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
LUK.1.10	And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.
LUK.1.11	And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
LUK.1.12	And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
LUK.1.13	But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
LUK.1.14	And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
LUK.1.15	For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.
LUK.1.16	And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
LUK.1.17	And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
LUK.1.18	And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.
LUK.1.19	And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.
LUK.1.20	And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
LUK.1.21	And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.
LUK.1.22	And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.
LUK.1.23	And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
LUK.1.24	And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,
LUK.1.25	Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.
LUK.1.26	And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
LUK.1.27	To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.
LUK.1.28	And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
LUK.1.29	And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
LUK.1.30	And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.
LUK.1.31	And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
LUK.1.32	He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:
LUK.1.33	And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
LUK.1.34	Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
LUK.1.35	And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
LUK.1.36	And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.
LUK.1.37	For with God nothing shall be impossible.
LUK.1.38	And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
LUK.1.39	And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;
LUK.1.40	And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.
LUK.1.41	And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:
LUK.1.42	And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
LUK.1.43	And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
LUK.1.44	For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
LUK.1.45	And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.
LUK.1.46	And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,
LUK.1.47	And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
LUK.1.48	For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
LUK.1.49	For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.
LUK.1.50	And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.
LUK.1.51	He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
LUK.1.52	He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.
LUK.1.53	He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.
LUK.1.54	He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;
LUK.1.55	As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.
LUK.1.56	And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.
LUK.1.57	Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
LUK.1.58	And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.
LUK.1.59	And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.
LUK.1.60	And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.
LUK.1.61	And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.
LUK.1.62	And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.
LUK.1.63	And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.
LUK.1.64	And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.
LUK.1.65	And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.
LUK.1.66	And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.
LUK.1.67	And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,
LUK.1.68	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,
LUK.1.69	And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;
LUK.1.70	As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:
LUK.1.71	That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
LUK.1.72	To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;
LUK.1.73	The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,
LUK.1.74	That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,
LUK.1.75	In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.
LUK.1.76	And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;
LUK.1.77	To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,
LUK.1.78	Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,
LUK.1.79	To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
LUK.1.80	And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.
LUK.2.1	And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.
LUK.2.2	(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)
LUK.2.3	And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.
LUK.2.4	And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)
LUK.2.5	To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.
LUK.2.6	And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
LUK.2.7	And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
LUK.2.8	And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
LUK.2.9	And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
LUK.2.10	And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
LUK.2.11	For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.
LUK.2.12	And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.
LUK.2.13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
LUK.2.14	Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.
LUK.2.15	And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.
LUK.2.16	And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.
LUK.2.17	And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.
LUK.2.18	And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
LUK.2.19	But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.
LUK.2.20	And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.
LUK.2.21	And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
LUK.2.22	And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;
LUK.2.23	(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)
LUK.2.24	And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
LUK.2.25	And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.
LUK.2.26	And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
LUK.2.27	And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,
LUK.2.28	Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,
LUK.2.29	Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:
LUK.2.30	For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
LUK.2.31	Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
LUK.2.32	A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.
LUK.2.33	And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.
LUK.2.34	And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;
LUK.2.35	(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
LUK.2.36	And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;
LUK.2.37	And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.
LUK.2.38	And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.
LUK.2.39	And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
LUK.2.40	And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
LUK.2.41	Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.
LUK.2.42	And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.
LUK.2.43	And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.
LUK.2.44	But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.
LUK.2.45	And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.
LUK.2.46	And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.
LUK.2.47	And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.
LUK.2.48	And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
LUK.2.49	And he said unto them, 
LUK.2.50	And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.
LUK.2.51	And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
LUK.2.52	And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.
LUK.3.1	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,
LUK.3.2	Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
LUK.3.3	And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;
LUK.3.4	As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
LUK.3.5	Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;
LUK.3.6	And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
LUK.3.7	Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
LUK.3.8	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
LUK.3.9	And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
LUK.3.10	And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?
LUK.3.11	He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.
LUK.3.12	Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?
LUK.3.13	And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.
LUK.3.14	And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.
LUK.3.15	And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;
LUK.3.16	John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:
LUK.3.17	Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.
LUK.3.18	And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people.
LUK.3.19	But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,
LUK.3.20	Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.
LUK.3.21	Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
LUK.3.22	And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.
LUK.3.23	And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,
LUK.3.24	Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was the son of Joseph,
LUK.3.25	Which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Amos, which was the son of Naum, which was the son of Esli, which was the son of Nagge,
LUK.3.26	Which was the son of Maath, which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Semei, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Juda,
LUK.3.27	Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son of Rhesa, which was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel, which was the son of Neri,
LUK.3.28	Which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Addi, which was the son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was the son of Er,
LUK.3.29	Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi,
LUK.3.30	Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was the son of Eliakim,
LUK.3.31	Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan, which was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which was the son of David,
LUK.3.32	Which was the son of Jesse, which was the son of Obed, which was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which was the son of Naasson,
LUK.3.33	Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram, which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which was the son of Judah,
LUK.3.34	Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was the son of Nachor,
LUK.3.35	Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was the son of Sala,
LUK.3.36	Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noah, which was the son of Lamech,
LUK.3.37	Which was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch, which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel, which was the son of Cainan,
LUK.3.38	Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.
LUK.4.1	And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
LUK.4.2	Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.
LUK.4.3	And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.
LUK.4.4	And Jesus answered him, saying, 
LUK.4.5	And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
LUK.4.6	And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.
LUK.4.7	If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.
LUK.4.8	And Jesus answered and said unto him, 
LUK.4.9	And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:
LUK.4.10	For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:
LUK.4.11	And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
LUK.4.12	And Jesus answering said unto him, 
LUK.4.13	And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.
LUK.4.14	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.
LUK.4.15	And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
LUK.4.16	And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.
LUK.4.17	And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,
LUK.4.20	And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.
LUK.4.21	And he began to say unto them, 
LUK.4.22	And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?
LUK.4.23	And he said unto them, 
LUK.4.24	And he said, 
LUK.4.28	And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,
LUK.4.29	And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.
LUK.4.30	But he passing through the midst of them went his way,
LUK.4.31	And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.
LUK.4.32	And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.
LUK.4.33	And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,
LUK.4.34	Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.
LUK.4.35	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, 
LUK.4.36	And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.
LUK.4.37	And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.
LUK.4.38	And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her.
LUK.4.39	And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.
LUK.4.40	Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
LUK.4.41	And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.
LUK.4.42	And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.
LUK.4.43	And he said unto them, 
LUK.4.44	And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
LUK.5.1	And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,
LUK.5.2	And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
LUK.5.3	And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.
LUK.5.4	Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, 
LUK.5.5	And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.
LUK.5.6	And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.
LUK.5.7	And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.
LUK.5.8	When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
LUK.5.9	For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:
LUK.5.10	And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, 
LUK.5.11	And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.
LUK.5.12	And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
LUK.5.13	And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, 
LUK.5.14	And he charged him to tell no man: 
LUK.5.15	But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
LUK.5.16	And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
LUK.5.17	And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.
LUK.5.18	And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.
LUK.5.19	And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.
LUK.5.20	And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, 
LUK.5.21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
LUK.5.22	But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, 
LUK.5.25	And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.
LUK.5.26	And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.
LUK.5.27	And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, 
LUK.5.28	And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
LUK.5.29	And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.
LUK.5.30	But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
LUK.5.31	And Jesus answering said unto them, 
LUK.5.33	And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?
LUK.5.34	And he said unto them, 
LUK.5.36	And he spake also a parable unto them; 
LUK.6.1	And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.
LUK.6.2	And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?
LUK.6.3	And Jesus answering them said, 
LUK.6.5	And he said unto them, 
LUK.6.6	And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.
LUK.6.7	And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.
LUK.6.8	But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, 
LUK.6.9	Then said Jesus unto them, 
LUK.6.10	And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, 
LUK.6.11	And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.
LUK.6.12	And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.
LUK.6.13	And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;
LUK.6.14	Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
LUK.6.15	Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,
LUK.6.16	And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.
LUK.6.17	And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;
LUK.6.18	And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.
LUK.6.19	And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.
LUK.6.20	And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, 
LUK.7.1	Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
LUK.7.2	And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.
LUK.7.3	And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.
LUK.7.4	And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:
LUK.7.5	For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.
LUK.7.6	Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:
LUK.7.7	Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
LUK.7.8	For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
LUK.7.9	When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, 
LUK.7.10	And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.
LUK.7.11	And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.
LUK.7.12	Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
LUK.7.13	And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, 
LUK.7.14	And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, 
LUK.7.15	And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.
LUK.7.16	And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.
LUK.7.17	And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.
LUK.7.18	And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.
LUK.7.19	And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
LUK.7.20	When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
LUK.7.21	And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.
LUK.7.22	Then Jesus answering said unto them, 
LUK.7.24	And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, 
LUK.7.29	And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
LUK.7.30	But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.
LUK.7.31	And the Lord said, 
LUK.7.36	And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.
LUK.7.37	And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
LUK.7.38	And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
LUK.7.39	Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.
LUK.7.40	And Jesus answering said unto him, 
LUK.7.43	Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, 
LUK.7.44	And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, 
LUK.7.48	And he said unto her, 
LUK.7.49	And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
LUK.7.50	And he said to the woman, 
LUK.8.1	And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,
LUK.8.2	And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,
LUK.8.3	And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.
LUK.8.4	And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:
LUK.8.9	And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
LUK.8.10	And he said, 
LUK.8.19	Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.
LUK.8.20	And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.
LUK.8.21	And he answered and said unto them, 
LUK.8.22	Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, 
LUK.8.23	But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.
LUK.8.24	And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
LUK.8.25	And he said unto them, 
LUK.8.26	And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.
LUK.8.27	And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.
LUK.8.28	When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.
LUK.8.29	(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)
LUK.8.30	And Jesus asked him, saying, 
LUK.8.31	And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.
LUK.8.32	And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.
LUK.8.33	Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.
LUK.8.34	When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.
LUK.8.35	Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
LUK.8.36	They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.
LUK.8.37	Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.
LUK.8.38	Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,
LUK.8.40	And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.
LUK.8.41	And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:
LUK.8.42	For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.
LUK.8.43	And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,
LUK.8.44	Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.
LUK.8.45	And Jesus said, 
LUK.8.46	And Jesus said, 
LUK.8.47	And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
LUK.8.48	And he said unto her, 
LUK.8.49	While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.
LUK.8.50	But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, 
LUK.8.51	And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.
LUK.8.52	And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, 
LUK.8.53	And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
LUK.8.54	And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, 
LUK.8.55	And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.
LUK.8.56	And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.
LUK.9.1	Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.
LUK.9.2	And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
LUK.9.3	And he said unto them, 
LUK.9.6	And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.
LUK.9.7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;
LUK.9.8	And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
LUK.9.9	And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.
LUK.9.10	And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
LUK.9.11	And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.
LUK.9.12	And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.
LUK.9.13	But he said unto them, 
LUK.9.14	For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, 
LUK.9.15	And they did so, and made them all sit down.
LUK.9.16	Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
LUK.9.17	And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.
LUK.9.18	And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, 
LUK.9.19	They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.
LUK.9.20	He said unto them, 
LUK.9.21	And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;
LUK.9.22	Saying, 
LUK.9.23	And he said to them all, 
LUK.9.28	And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.
LUK.9.29	And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.
LUK.9.30	And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:
LUK.9.31	Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.
LUK.9.32	But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
LUK.9.33	And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.
LUK.9.34	While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
LUK.9.35	And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
LUK.9.36	And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.
LUK.9.37	And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.
LUK.9.38	And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.
LUK.9.39	And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.
LUK.9.40	And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.
LUK.9.41	And Jesus answering said, 
LUK.9.42	And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.
LUK.9.43	And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,
LUK.9.45	But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.
LUK.9.46	Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.
LUK.9.47	And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,
LUK.9.48	And said unto them, 
LUK.9.49	And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.
LUK.9.50	And Jesus said unto him, 
LUK.9.51	And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,
LUK.9.52	And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
LUK.9.53	And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.
LUK.9.54	And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?
LUK.9.55	But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, 
LUK.9.57	And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
LUK.9.58	And Jesus said unto him, 
LUK.9.59	And he said unto another, 
LUK.9.60	Jesus said unto him, 
LUK.9.61	And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.
LUK.9.62	And Jesus said unto him, 
LUK.10.1	After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.
LUK.10.2	Therefore said he unto them, 
LUK.10.17	And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.
LUK.10.18	And he said unto them, 
LUK.10.21	In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, 
LUK.10.23	And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, 
LUK.10.25	And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
LUK.10.26	He said unto him, 
LUK.10.27	And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.
LUK.10.28	And he said unto him, 
LUK.10.29	But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?
LUK.10.30	And Jesus answering said, 
LUK.10.37	And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, 
LUK.10.38	Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
LUK.10.39	And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.
LUK.10.40	But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.
LUK.10.41	And Jesus answered and said unto her, 
LUK.11.1	And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
LUK.11.2	And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, 
LUK.11.5	And he said unto them, 
LUK.11.14	And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.
LUK.11.15	But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.
LUK.11.16	And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.
LUK.11.17	But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, 
LUK.11.27	And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.
LUK.11.28	But he said, 
LUK.11.29	And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, 
LUK.11.37	And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.
LUK.11.38	And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.
LUK.11.39	And the Lord said unto him, 
LUK.11.45	Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.
LUK.11.46	And he said, 
LUK.11.53	And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:
LUK.11.54	Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.
LUK.12.1	In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, 
LUK.12.13	And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.
LUK.12.14	And he said unto him, 
LUK.12.15	And he said unto them, 
LUK.12.16	And he spake a parable unto them, saying, 
LUK.12.22	And he said unto his disciples, 
LUK.12.41	Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?
LUK.12.42	And the Lord said, 
LUK.12.54	And he said also to the people, 
LUK.13.1	There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
LUK.13.2	And Jesus answering said unto them, 
LUK.13.6	He spake also this parable; 
LUK.13.10	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
LUK.13.11	And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.
LUK.13.12	And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, 
LUK.13.13	And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.
LUK.13.14	And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.
LUK.13.15	The Lord then answered him, and said, 
LUK.13.17	And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
LUK.13.18	Then said he, 
LUK.13.20	And again he said, 
LUK.13.22	And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.
LUK.13.23	Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,
LUK.13.31	The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.
LUK.13.32	And he said unto them, 
LUK.14.1	And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.
LUK.14.2	And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy.
LUK.14.3	And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, 
LUK.14.4	And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;
LUK.14.5	And answered them, saying, 
LUK.14.6	And they could not answer him again to these things.
LUK.14.7	And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,
LUK.14.12	Then said he also to him that bade him, 
LUK.14.15	And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
LUK.14.16	Then said he unto him, 
LUK.14.25	And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,
LUK.15.1	Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.
LUK.15.2	And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
LUK.15.3	And he spake this parable unto them, saying,
LUK.15.11	And he said, 
LUK.16.1	And he said also unto his disciples, 
LUK.16.14	And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.
LUK.16.15	And he said unto them, 
LUK.17.1	Then said he unto the disciples, 
LUK.17.5	And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
LUK.17.6	And the Lord said, 
LUK.17.11	And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
LUK.17.12	And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:
LUK.17.13	And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
LUK.17.14	And when he saw them, he said unto them, 
LUK.17.15	And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,
LUK.17.16	And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
LUK.17.17	And Jesus answering said, 
LUK.17.19	And he said unto him, 
LUK.17.20	And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, 
LUK.17.22	And he said unto the disciples, 
LUK.17.37	And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, 
LUK.18.1	And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
LUK.18.2	Saying, 
LUK.18.6	And the Lord said, 
LUK.18.9	And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:
LUK.18.15	And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
LUK.18.16	But Jesus called them unto him, and said, 
LUK.18.18	And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
LUK.18.19	And Jesus said unto him, 
LUK.18.21	And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
LUK.18.22	Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, 
LUK.18.23	And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.
LUK.18.24	And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, 
LUK.18.26	And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?
LUK.18.27	And he said, 
LUK.18.28	Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
LUK.18.29	And he said unto them, 
LUK.18.31	Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, 
LUK.18.34	And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
LUK.18.35	And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
LUK.18.36	And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
LUK.18.37	And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
LUK.18.38	And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
LUK.18.39	And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
LUK.18.40	And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,
LUK.18.41	Saying, 
LUK.18.42	And Jesus said unto him, 
LUK.18.43	And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.
LUK.19.1	And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.
LUK.19.2	And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.
LUK.19.3	And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.
LUK.19.4	And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.
LUK.19.5	And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, 
LUK.19.6	And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
LUK.19.7	And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
LUK.19.8	And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.
LUK.19.9	And Jesus said unto him, 
LUK.19.11	And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.
LUK.19.12	He said therefore, 
LUK.19.28	And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.
LUK.19.29	And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
LUK.19.30	Saying, 
LUK.19.32	And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.
LUK.19.33	And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?
LUK.19.34	And they said, The Lord hath need of him.
LUK.19.35	And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.
LUK.19.36	And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
LUK.19.37	And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;
LUK.19.38	Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
LUK.19.39	And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
LUK.19.40	And he answered and said unto them, 
LUK.19.41	And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
LUK.19.42	Saying, 
LUK.19.45	And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;
LUK.19.46	Saying unto them, 
LUK.19.47	And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,
LUK.19.48	And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.
LUK.20.1	And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,
LUK.20.2	And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?
LUK.20.3	And he answered and said unto them, 
LUK.20.5	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?
LUK.20.6	But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.
LUK.20.7	And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.
LUK.20.8	And Jesus said unto them, 
LUK.20.9	Then began he to speak to the people this parable; 
LUK.20.17	And he beheld them, and said, 
LUK.20.19	And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.
LUK.20.20	And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.
LUK.20.21	And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:
LUK.20.22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?
LUK.20.23	But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, 
LUK.20.25	And he said unto them, 
LUK.20.26	And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.
LUK.20.27	Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,
LUK.20.28	Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
LUK.20.29	There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.
LUK.20.30	And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.
LUK.20.31	And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.
LUK.20.32	Last of all the woman died also.
LUK.20.33	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.
LUK.20.34	And Jesus answering said unto them, 
LUK.20.39	Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.
LUK.20.40	And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.
LUK.20.41	And he said unto them, 
LUK.20.45	Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,
LUK.21.1	And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.
LUK.21.2	And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
LUK.21.3	And he said, 
LUK.21.5	And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,
LUK.21.7	And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?
LUK.21.8	And he said, 
LUK.21.10	Then said he unto them, 
LUK.21.29	And he spake to them a parable; 
LUK.21.37	And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.
LUK.21.38	And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.
LUK.22.1	Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.
LUK.22.2	And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
LUK.22.3	Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
LUK.22.4	And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.
LUK.22.5	And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
LUK.22.6	And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
LUK.22.7	Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.
LUK.22.8	And he sent Peter and John, saying, 
LUK.22.9	And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
LUK.22.10	And he said unto them, 
LUK.22.13	And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
LUK.22.14	And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
LUK.22.15	And he said unto them, 
LUK.22.17	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, 
LUK.22.19	And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, 
LUK.22.20	Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, 
LUK.22.23	And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
LUK.22.24	And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.
LUK.22.25	And he said unto them, 
LUK.22.31	And the Lord said, 
LUK.22.33	And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.
LUK.22.34	And he said, 
LUK.22.35	And he said unto them, 
LUK.22.36	Then said he unto them, 
LUK.22.38	And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, 
LUK.22.39	And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.
LUK.22.40	And when he was at the place, he said unto them, 
LUK.22.41	And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,
LUK.22.42	Saying, 
LUK.22.43	And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.
LUK.22.44	And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
LUK.22.45	And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,
LUK.22.46	And said unto them, 
LUK.22.47	And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.
LUK.22.48	But Jesus said unto him, 
LUK.22.49	When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
LUK.22.50	And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
LUK.22.51	And Jesus answered and said, 
LUK.22.52	Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, 
LUK.22.54	Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.
LUK.22.55	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.
LUK.22.56	But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.
LUK.22.57	And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
LUK.22.58	And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
LUK.22.59	And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.
LUK.22.60	And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.
LUK.22.61	And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, 
LUK.22.62	And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
LUK.22.63	And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.
LUK.22.64	And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?
LUK.22.65	And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
LUK.22.66	And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,
LUK.22.67	Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, 
LUK.22.70	Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, 
LUK.22.71	And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.
LUK.23.1	And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
LUK.23.2	And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.
LUK.23.3	And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, 
LUK.23.4	Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.
LUK.23.5	And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee to this place.
LUK.23.6	When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
LUK.23.7	And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
LUK.23.8	And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.
LUK.23.9	Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
LUK.23.10	And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
LUK.23.11	And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
LUK.23.12	And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
LUK.23.13	And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
LUK.23.14	Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
LUK.23.15	No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.
LUK.23.16	I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
LUK.23.17	(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
LUK.23.18	And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:
LUK.23.19	(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
LUK.23.20	Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
LUK.23.21	But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.
LUK.23.22	And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.
LUK.23.23	And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
LUK.23.24	And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
LUK.23.25	And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
LUK.23.26	And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.
LUK.23.27	And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
LUK.23.28	But Jesus turning unto them said, 
LUK.23.32	And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
LUK.23.33	And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
LUK.23.34	Then said Jesus, 
LUK.23.35	And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.
LUK.23.36	And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
LUK.23.37	And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.
LUK.23.38	And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
LUK.23.39	And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
LUK.23.40	But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
LUK.23.41	And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
LUK.23.42	And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
LUK.23.43	And Jesus said unto him, 
LUK.23.44	And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
LUK.23.45	And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
LUK.23.46	And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, 
LUK.23.47	Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
LUK.23.48	And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
LUK.23.49	And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
LUK.23.50	And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:
LUK.23.51	(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
LUK.23.52	This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
LUK.23.53	And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.
LUK.23.54	And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
LUK.23.55	And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
LUK.23.56	And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
LUK.24.1	Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
LUK.24.2	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
LUK.24.3	And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
LUK.24.4	And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
LUK.24.5	And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
LUK.24.6	He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
LUK.24.7	Saying, 
LUK.24.8	And they remembered his words,
LUK.24.9	And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
LUK.24.10	It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.
LUK.24.11	And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
LUK.24.12	Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
LUK.24.13	And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.
LUK.24.14	And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
LUK.24.15	And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
LUK.24.16	But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
LUK.24.17	And he said unto them, 
LUK.24.18	And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?
LUK.24.19	And he said unto them, 
LUK.24.20	And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
LUK.24.21	But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
LUK.24.22	Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
LUK.24.23	And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.
LUK.24.24	And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
LUK.24.25	Then he said unto them, 
LUK.24.27	And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
LUK.24.28	And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
LUK.24.29	But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
LUK.24.30	And it came to pass, as he sat at the table with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.
LUK.24.31	And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
LUK.24.32	And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
LUK.24.33	And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
LUK.24.34	Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
LUK.24.35	And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.
LUK.24.36	And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, 
LUK.24.37	But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
LUK.24.38	And he said unto them, 
LUK.24.40	And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.
LUK.24.41	And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, 
LUK.24.42	And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
LUK.24.43	And he took it, and did eat before them.
LUK.24.44	And he said unto them, 
LUK.24.45	Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
LUK.24.46	And said unto them, 
LUK.24.50	And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
LUK.24.51	And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.
LUK.24.52	And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
LUK.24.53	And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
JHN.1.1	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
JHN.1.2	The same was in the beginning with God.
JHN.1.3	All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
JHN.1.4	In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
JHN.1.5	And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
JHN.1.6	There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
JHN.1.7	The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.
JHN.1.8	He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
JHN.1.9	That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
JHN.1.10	He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
JHN.1.11	He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
JHN.1.12	But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
JHN.1.13	Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
JHN.1.14	And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
JHN.1.15	John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.
JHN.1.16	And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.
JHN.1.17	For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
JHN.1.18	No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.
JHN.1.19	And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?
JHN.1.20	And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.
JHN.1.21	And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.
JHN.1.22	Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
JHN.1.23	He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.
JHN.1.24	And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
JHN.1.25	And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?
JHN.1.26	John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
JHN.1.27	He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.
JHN.1.28	These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
JHN.1.29	The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.
JHN.1.30	This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.
JHN.1.31	And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
JHN.1.32	And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.
JHN.1.33	And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.
JHN.1.34	And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.
JHN.1.35	Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
JHN.1.36	And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!
JHN.1.37	And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
JHN.1.38	Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, 
JHN.1.39	He saith unto them, 
JHN.1.40	One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
JHN.1.41	He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.
JHN.1.42	And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, 
JHN.1.43	The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, 
JHN.1.44	Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
JHN.1.45	Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
JHN.1.46	And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
JHN.1.47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, 
JHN.1.48	Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, 
JHN.1.49	Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
JHN.1.50	Jesus answered and said unto him, 
JHN.1.51	And he saith unto him, 
JHN.2.1	And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
JHN.2.2	And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
JHN.2.3	And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.
JHN.2.4	Jesus saith unto her, 
JHN.2.5	His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.
JHN.2.6	And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
JHN.2.7	Jesus saith unto them, 
JHN.2.8	And he saith unto them, 
JHN.2.9	When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
JHN.2.10	And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.
JHN.2.11	This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
JHN.2.12	After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
JHN.2.13	And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
JHN.2.14	And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
JHN.2.15	And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;
JHN.2.16	And said unto them that sold doves, 
JHN.2.17	And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
JHN.2.18	Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
JHN.2.19	Jesus answered and said unto them, 
JHN.2.20	Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
JHN.2.21	But he spake of the temple of his body.
JHN.2.22	When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
JHN.2.23	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
JHN.2.24	But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,
JHN.2.25	And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
JHN.3.1	There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
JHN.3.2	The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
JHN.3.3	Jesus answered and said unto him, 
JHN.3.4	Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
JHN.3.5	Jesus answered, 
JHN.3.9	Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
JHN.3.10	Jesus answered and said unto him, 
JHN.3.22	After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
JHN.3.23	And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
JHN.3.24	For John was not yet cast into prison.
JHN.3.25	Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.
JHN.3.26	And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.
JHN.3.27	John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
JHN.3.28	Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
JHN.3.29	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
JHN.3.30	He must increase, but I must decrease.
JHN.3.31	He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.
JHN.3.32	And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.
JHN.3.33	He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.
JHN.3.34	For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.
JHN.3.35	The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
JHN.3.36	He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
JHN.4.1	When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
JHN.4.2	(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
JHN.4.3	He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
JHN.4.4	And he must needs go through Samaria.
JHN.4.5	Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
JHN.4.6	Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.
JHN.4.7	There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, 
JHN.4.8	(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
JHN.4.9	Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
JHN.4.10	Jesus answered and said unto her, 
JHN.4.11	The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?
JHN.4.12	Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
JHN.4.13	Jesus answered and said unto her, 
JHN.4.15	The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
JHN.4.16	Jesus saith unto her, 
JHN.4.17	The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, 
JHN.4.19	The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
JHN.4.20	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
JHN.4.21	Jesus saith unto her, 
JHN.4.25	The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
JHN.4.26	Jesus saith unto her, 
JHN.4.27	And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
JHN.4.28	The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
JHN.4.29	Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
JHN.4.30	Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
JHN.4.31	In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
JHN.4.32	But he said unto them, 
JHN.4.33	Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?
JHN.4.34	Jesus saith unto them, 
JHN.4.39	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.
JHN.4.40	So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
JHN.4.41	And many more believed because of his own word;
JHN.4.42	And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
JHN.4.43	Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
JHN.4.44	For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
JHN.4.45	Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
JHN.4.46	So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
JHN.4.47	When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
JHN.4.48	Then said Jesus unto him, 
JHN.4.49	The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
JHN.4.50	Jesus saith unto him, 
JHN.4.51	And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.
JHN.4.52	Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
JHN.4.53	So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, 
JHN.4.54	This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
JHN.5.1	After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
JHN.5.2	Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
JHN.5.3	In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
JHN.5.4	For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
JHN.5.5	And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
JHN.5.6	When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, 
JHN.5.7	The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
JHN.5.8	Jesus saith unto him, 
JHN.5.9	And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
JHN.5.10	The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.
JHN.5.11	He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, 
JHN.5.12	Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, 
JHN.5.13	And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.
JHN.5.14	Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, 
JHN.5.15	The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.
JHN.5.16	And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.
JHN.5.17	But Jesus answered them, 
JHN.5.18	Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
JHN.5.19	Then answered Jesus and said unto them, 
JHN.6.1	After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
JHN.6.2	And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
JHN.6.3	And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
JHN.6.4	And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
JHN.6.5	When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, 
JHN.6.6	And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
JHN.6.7	Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
JHN.6.8	One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,
JHN.6.9	There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?
JHN.6.10	And Jesus said, 
JHN.6.11	And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
JHN.6.12	When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, 
JHN.6.13	Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.
JHN.6.14	Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.
JHN.6.15	When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.
JHN.6.16	And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,
JHN.6.17	And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.
JHN.6.18	And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
JHN.6.19	So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.
JHN.6.20	But he saith unto them, 
JHN.6.21	Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.
JHN.6.22	The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;
JHN.6.23	(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)
JHN.6.24	When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
JHN.6.25	And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
JHN.6.26	Jesus answered them and said, 
JHN.6.28	Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?
JHN.6.29	Jesus answered and said unto them, 
JHN.6.30	They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?
JHN.6.31	Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
JHN.6.32	Then Jesus said unto them, 
JHN.6.34	Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
JHN.6.35	And Jesus said unto them, 
JHN.6.41	The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, 
JHN.6.42	And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, 
JHN.6.43	Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, 
JHN.6.52	The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
JHN.6.53	Then Jesus said unto them, 
JHN.6.59	These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
JHN.6.60	Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?
JHN.6.61	When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, 
JHN.6.65	And he said, 
JHN.6.66	From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
JHN.6.67	Then said Jesus unto the twelve, 
JHN.6.68	Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.
JHN.6.69	And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.
JHN.6.70	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.6.71	He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.
JHN.7.1	After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
JHN.7.2	Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.
JHN.7.3	His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
JHN.7.4	For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.
JHN.7.5	For neither did his brethren believe in him.
JHN.7.6	Then Jesus said unto them, 
JHN.7.9	When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.
JHN.7.10	But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
JHN.7.11	Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
JHN.7.12	And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.
JHN.7.13	Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
JHN.7.14	Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
JHN.7.15	And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
JHN.7.16	Jesus answered them, and said, 
JHN.7.20	The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?
JHN.7.21	Jesus answered and said unto them, 
JHN.7.25	Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
JHN.7.26	But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
JHN.7.27	Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
JHN.7.28	Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, 
JHN.7.30	Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
JHN.7.31	And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?
JHN.7.32	The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
JHN.7.33	Then said Jesus unto them, 
JHN.7.35	Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
JHN.7.36	What manner of saying is this that he said, 
JHN.7.37	In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, 
JHN.7.39	(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
JHN.7.40	Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
JHN.7.41	Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
JHN.7.42	Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
JHN.7.43	So there was a division among the people because of him.
JHN.7.44	And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
JHN.7.45	Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
JHN.7.46	The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
JHN.7.47	Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
JHN.7.48	Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
JHN.7.49	But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
JHN.7.50	Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
JHN.7.51	Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
JHN.7.52	They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
JHN.7.53	And every man went unto his own house.
JHN.8.1	Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
JHN.8.2	And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
JHN.8.3	And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,
JHN.8.4	They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
JHN.8.5	Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?
JHN.8.6	This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.
JHN.8.7	So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, 
JHN.8.8	And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
JHN.8.9	And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
JHN.8.10	When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, 
JHN.8.11	She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, 
JHN.8.12	Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, 
JHN.8.13	The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.
JHN.8.14	Jesus answered and said unto them, 
JHN.8.19	Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.20	These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
JHN.8.21	Then said Jesus again unto them, 
JHN.8.22	Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, 
JHN.8.23	And he said unto them, 
JHN.8.25	Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, 
JHN.8.27	They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
JHN.8.28	Then said Jesus unto them, 
JHN.8.30	As he spake these words, many believed on him.
JHN.8.31	Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, 
JHN.8.33	They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, 
JHN.8.34	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.8.39	They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, 
JHN.8.42	Jesus said unto them, 
JHN.8.48	Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
JHN.8.49	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.52	Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, 
JHN.8.53	Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?
JHN.8.54	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.57	Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
JHN.8.58	Jesus said unto them, 
JHN.8.59	Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
JHN.9.1	And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.
JHN.9.2	And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
JHN.9.3	Jesus answered, 
JHN.9.6	When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
JHN.9.7	And said unto him, 
JHN.9.8	The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
JHN.9.9	Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.
JHN.9.10	Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?
JHN.9.11	He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, 
JHN.9.12	Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
JHN.9.13	They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
JHN.9.14	And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
JHN.9.15	Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
JHN.9.16	Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
JHN.9.17	They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
JHN.9.18	But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
JHN.9.19	And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?
JHN.9.20	His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
JHN.9.21	But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
JHN.9.22	These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
JHN.9.23	Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
JHN.9.24	Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
JHN.9.25	He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
JHN.9.26	Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?
JHN.9.27	He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?
JHN.9.28	Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.
JHN.9.29	We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.
JHN.9.30	The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.
JHN.9.31	Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
JHN.9.32	Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
JHN.9.33	If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
JHN.9.34	They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
JHN.9.35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, 
JHN.9.36	He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
JHN.9.37	And Jesus said unto him, 
JHN.9.38	And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
JHN.9.39	And Jesus said, 
JHN.9.40	And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?
JHN.9.41	Jesus said unto them, 
JHN.10.6	This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
JHN.10.7	Then said Jesus unto them again, 
JHN.10.19	There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
JHN.10.20	And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?
JHN.10.21	Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
JHN.10.22	And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
JHN.10.23	And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
JHN.10.24	Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.
JHN.10.25	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.31	Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
JHN.10.32	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.33	The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
JHN.10.34	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.39	Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,
JHN.10.40	And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.
JHN.10.41	And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.
JHN.10.42	And many believed on him there.
JHN.11.1	Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
JHN.11.2	(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
JHN.11.3	Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
JHN.11.4	When Jesus heard that, he said, 
JHN.11.5	Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
JHN.11.6	When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
JHN.11.7	Then after that saith he to his disciples, 
JHN.11.8	His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
JHN.11.9	Jesus answered, 
JHN.11.11	These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, 
JHN.11.12	Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
JHN.11.13	Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
JHN.11.14	Then said Jesus unto them plainly, 
JHN.11.16	Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
JHN.11.17	Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.
JHN.11.18	Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
JHN.11.19	And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
JHN.11.20	Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.
JHN.11.21	Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
JHN.11.22	But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.
JHN.11.23	Jesus saith unto her, 
JHN.11.24	Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
JHN.11.25	Jesus said unto her, 
JHN.11.27	She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.
JHN.11.28	And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.
JHN.11.29	As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.
JHN.11.30	Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.
JHN.11.31	The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.
JHN.11.32	Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
JHN.11.33	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
JHN.11.34	And said, 
JHN.11.35	Jesus wept.
JHN.11.36	Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!
JHN.11.37	And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
JHN.11.38	Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
JHN.11.39	Jesus said, 
JHN.11.40	Jesus saith unto her, 
JHN.11.41	Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, 
JHN.11.43	And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, 
JHN.11.44	And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, 
JHN.11.45	Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.
JHN.11.46	But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.
JHN.11.47	Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.
JHN.11.48	If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.
JHN.11.49	And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,
JHN.11.50	Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
JHN.11.51	And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;
JHN.11.52	And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
JHN.11.53	Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.
JHN.11.54	Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
JHN.11.55	And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.
JHN.11.56	Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?
JHN.11.57	Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.
JHN.12.1	Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
JHN.12.2	There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.
JHN.12.3	Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
JHN.12.4	Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,
JHN.12.5	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
JHN.12.6	This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.
JHN.12.7	Then said Jesus, 
JHN.12.9	Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
JHN.12.10	But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;
JHN.12.11	Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
JHN.12.12	On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
JHN.12.13	Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.
JHN.12.14	And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
JHN.12.15	Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.
JHN.12.16	These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.
JHN.12.17	The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.
JHN.12.18	For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.
JHN.12.19	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
JHN.12.20	And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:
JHN.12.21	The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
JHN.12.22	Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
JHN.12.23	And Jesus answered them, saying, 
JHN.12.29	The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.
JHN.12.30	Jesus answered and said, 
JHN.12.33	This he said, signifying what death he should die.
JHN.12.34	The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, 
JHN.12.35	Then Jesus said unto them, 
JHN.12.37	But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:
JHN.12.38	That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
JHN.12.39	Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,
JHN.12.40	He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
JHN.12.41	These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
JHN.12.42	Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
JHN.12.43	For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
JHN.12.44	Jesus cried and said, 
JHN.13.1	Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
JHN.13.2	And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;
JHN.13.3	Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;
JHN.13.4	He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.
JHN.13.5	After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.
JHN.13.6	Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
JHN.13.7	Jesus answered and said unto him, 
JHN.13.8	Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, 
JHN.13.9	Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
JHN.13.10	Jesus saith to him, 
JHN.13.11	For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, 
JHN.13.12	So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, 
JHN.13.21	When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, 
JHN.13.22	Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
JHN.13.23	Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
JHN.13.24	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.
JHN.13.25	He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
JHN.13.26	Jesus answered, 
JHN.13.27	And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, 
JHN.13.28	Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
JHN.13.29	For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
JHN.13.30	He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.
JHN.13.31	Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, 
JHN.13.36	Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, 
JHN.13.37	Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.
JHN.13.38	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.14.5	Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?
JHN.14.6	Jesus saith unto him, 
JHN.14.8	Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
JHN.14.9	Jesus saith unto him, 
JHN.14.22	Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
JHN.14.23	Jesus answered and said unto him, 
JHN.16.1	These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.
JHN.16.17	Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, 
JHN.16.18	They said therefore, What is this that he saith, 
JHN.16.19	Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, 
JHN.16.29	His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.
JHN.16.30	Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
JHN.16.31	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.17.1	These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, 
JHN.18.1	When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.
JHN.18.2	And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.
JHN.18.3	Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
JHN.18.4	Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, 
JHN.18.5	They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, 
JHN.18.6	As soon then as he had said unto them, 
JHN.18.7	Then asked he them again, 
JHN.18.8	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.9	That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, 
JHN.18.10	Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
JHN.18.11	Then said Jesus unto Peter, 
JHN.18.12	Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,
JHN.18.13	And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.
JHN.18.14	Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
JHN.18.15	And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.
JHN.18.16	But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
JHN.18.17	Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.
JHN.18.18	And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
JHN.18.19	The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
JHN.18.20	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.18.22	And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?
JHN.18.23	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.18.24	Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
JHN.18.25	And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.
JHN.18.26	One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
JHN.18.27	Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
JHN.18.28	Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
JHN.18.29	Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?
JHN.18.30	They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.
JHN.18.31	Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
JHN.18.32	That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.
JHN.18.33	Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
JHN.18.34	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.18.35	Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
JHN.18.36	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.37	Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.38	Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.
JHN.18.39	But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
JHN.18.40	Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
JHN.19.1	Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
JHN.19.2	And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,
JHN.19.3	And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.
JHN.19.4	Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.
JHN.19.5	Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!
JHN.19.6	When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.
JHN.19.7	The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
JHN.19.8	When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
JHN.19.9	And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
JHN.19.10	Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?
JHN.19.11	Jesus answered, 
JHN.19.12	And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.
JHN.19.13	When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
JHN.19.14	And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!
JHN.19.15	But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
JHN.19.16	Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.
JHN.19.17	And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:
JHN.19.18	Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
JHN.19.19	And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
JHN.19.20	This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.
JHN.19.21	Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
JHN.19.22	Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
JHN.19.23	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
JHN.19.24	They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.
JHN.19.25	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
JHN.19.26	When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, 
JHN.19.27	Then saith he to the disciple, 
JHN.19.28	After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, 
JHN.19.29	Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.
JHN.19.30	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, 
JHN.19.31	The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
JHN.19.32	Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.
JHN.19.33	But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:
JHN.19.34	But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.
JHN.19.35	And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.
JHN.19.36	For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
JHN.19.37	And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
JHN.19.38	And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
JHN.19.39	And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.
JHN.19.40	Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
JHN.19.41	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.
JHN.19.42	There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
JHN.20.1	The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
JHN.20.2	Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.
JHN.20.3	Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.
JHN.20.4	So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.
JHN.20.5	And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.
JHN.20.6	Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,
JHN.20.7	And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
JHN.20.8	Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.
JHN.20.9	For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.
JHN.20.10	Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
JHN.20.11	But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,
JHN.20.12	And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
JHN.20.13	And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
JHN.20.14	And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
JHN.20.15	Jesus saith unto her, 
JHN.20.16	Jesus saith unto her, 
JHN.20.17	Jesus saith unto her, 
JHN.20.18	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her.
JHN.20.19	Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, 
JHN.20.20	And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.
JHN.20.21	Then said Jesus to them again, 
JHN.20.22	And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, 
JHN.20.24	But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
JHN.20.25	The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.
JHN.20.26	And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, 
JHN.20.27	Then saith he to Thomas, 
JHN.20.28	And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
JHN.20.29	Jesus saith unto him, 
JHN.20.30	And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
JHN.20.31	But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.
JHN.21.1	After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.
JHN.21.2	There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
JHN.21.3	Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
JHN.21.4	But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
JHN.21.5	Then Jesus saith unto them, 
JHN.21.6	And he said unto them, 
JHN.21.7	Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
JHN.21.8	And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
JHN.21.9	As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
JHN.21.10	Jesus saith unto them, 
JHN.21.11	Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
JHN.21.12	Jesus saith unto them, 
JHN.21.13	Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.
JHN.21.14	This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
JHN.21.15	So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, 
JHN.21.16	He saith to him again the second time, 
JHN.21.17	He saith unto him the third time, 
JHN.21.19	This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, 
JHN.21.20	Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?
JHN.21.21	Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?
JHN.21.22	Jesus saith unto him, 
JHN.21.23	Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, 
JHN.21.24	This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
JHN.21.25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
ACT.1.1	The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,
ACT.1.2	Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:
ACT.1.3	To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:
ACT.1.4	And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, 
ACT.1.6	When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
ACT.1.7	And he said unto them, 
ACT.1.9	And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
ACT.1.10	And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
ACT.1.11	Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.
ACT.1.12	Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.
ACT.1.13	And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.
ACT.1.14	These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
ACT.1.15	And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)
ACT.1.16	Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.
ACT.1.17	For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.
ACT.1.18	Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
ACT.1.19	And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.
ACT.1.20	For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.
ACT.1.21	Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
ACT.1.22	Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.
ACT.1.23	And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
ACT.1.24	And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,
ACT.1.25	That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.
ACT.1.26	And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
ACT.2.1	And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
ACT.2.2	And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
ACT.2.3	And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
ACT.2.4	And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
ACT.2.5	And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
ACT.2.6	Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.
ACT.2.7	And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?
ACT.2.8	And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?
ACT.2.9	Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
ACT.2.10	Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,
ACT.2.11	Cretans and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.
ACT.2.12	And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?
ACT.2.13	Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.
ACT.2.14	But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:
ACT.2.15	For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.
ACT.2.16	But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;
ACT.2.17	And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:
ACT.2.18	And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:
ACT.2.19	And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:
ACT.2.20	The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:
ACT.2.21	And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
ACT.2.22	Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:
ACT.2.23	Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:
ACT.2.24	Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.
ACT.2.25	For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
ACT.2.26	Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:
ACT.2.27	Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
ACT.2.28	Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
ACT.2.29	Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.
ACT.2.30	Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;
ACT.2.31	He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.
ACT.2.32	This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
ACT.2.33	Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.
ACT.2.34	For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The 
ACT.2.35	Until I make thy foes thy footstool.
ACT.2.36	Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.
ACT.2.37	Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?
ACT.2.38	Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
ACT.2.39	For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.
ACT.2.40	And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.
ACT.2.41	Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.
ACT.2.42	And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
ACT.2.43	And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
ACT.2.44	And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
ACT.2.45	And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.
ACT.2.46	And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,
ACT.2.47	Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.
ACT.3.1	Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.
ACT.3.2	And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
ACT.3.3	Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.
ACT.3.4	And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.
ACT.3.5	And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.
ACT.3.6	Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.
ACT.3.7	And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
ACT.3.8	And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
ACT.3.9	And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
ACT.3.10	And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.
ACT.3.11	And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.
ACT.3.12	And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?
ACT.3.13	The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.
ACT.3.14	But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;
ACT.3.15	And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.
ACT.3.16	And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
ACT.3.17	And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.
ACT.3.18	But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.
ACT.3.19	Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;
ACT.3.20	And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:
ACT.3.21	Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.
ACT.3.22	For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.
ACT.3.23	And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.
ACT.3.24	Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.
ACT.3.25	Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
ACT.3.26	Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.
ACT.4.1	And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,
ACT.4.2	Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
ACT.4.3	And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.
ACT.4.4	Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
ACT.4.5	And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,
ACT.4.6	And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
ACT.4.7	And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?
ACT.4.8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
ACT.4.9	If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;
ACT.4.10	Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.
ACT.4.11	This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
ACT.4.12	Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
ACT.4.13	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
ACT.4.14	And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
ACT.4.15	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
ACT.4.16	Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.
ACT.4.17	But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.
ACT.4.18	And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
ACT.4.19	But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.
ACT.4.20	For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
ACT.4.21	So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.
ACT.4.22	For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.
ACT.4.23	And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.
ACT.4.24	And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:
ACT.4.25	Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?
ACT.4.26	The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.
ACT.4.27	For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,
ACT.4.28	For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.
ACT.4.29	And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,
ACT.4.30	By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.
ACT.4.31	And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
ACT.4.32	And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
ACT.4.33	And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
ACT.4.34	Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
ACT.4.35	And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.
ACT.4.36	And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,
ACT.4.37	Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
ACT.5.1	But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
ACT.5.2	And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
ACT.5.3	But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
ACT.5.4	Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.
ACT.5.5	And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.
ACT.5.6	And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.
ACT.5.7	And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.
ACT.5.8	And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.
ACT.5.9	Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.
ACT.5.10	Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.
ACT.5.11	And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.
ACT.5.12	And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.
ACT.5.13	And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.
ACT.5.14	And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)
ACT.5.15	Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.
ACT.5.16	There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.
ACT.5.17	Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,
ACT.5.18	And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.
ACT.5.19	But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,
ACT.5.20	Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.
ACT.5.21	And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
ACT.5.22	But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,
ACT.5.23	Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.
ACT.5.24	Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.
ACT.5.25	Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
ACT.5.26	Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.
ACT.5.27	And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,
ACT.5.28	Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.
ACT.5.29	Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.
ACT.5.30	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.
ACT.5.31	Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
ACT.5.32	And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
ACT.5.33	When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.
ACT.5.34	Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;
ACT.5.35	And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.
ACT.5.36	For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.
ACT.5.37	After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.
ACT.5.38	And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:
ACT.5.39	But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.
ACT.5.40	And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
ACT.5.41	And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.
ACT.5.42	And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.
ACT.6.1	And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
ACT.6.2	Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.
ACT.6.3	Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
ACT.6.4	But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
ACT.6.5	And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:
ACT.6.6	Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.
ACT.6.7	And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
ACT.6.8	And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
ACT.6.9	Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.
ACT.6.10	And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.
ACT.6.11	Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.
ACT.6.12	And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,
ACT.6.13	And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:
ACT.6.14	For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.
ACT.6.15	And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.
ACT.7.1	Then said the high priest, Are these things so?
ACT.7.2	And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
ACT.7.3	And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.
ACT.7.4	Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.
ACT.7.5	And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.
ACT.7.6	And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.
ACT.7.7	And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.
ACT.7.8	And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.
ACT.7.9	And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,
ACT.7.10	And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
ACT.7.11	Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.
ACT.7.12	But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.
ACT.7.13	And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.
ACT.7.14	Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
ACT.7.15	So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
ACT.7.16	And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.
ACT.7.17	But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
ACT.7.18	Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.
ACT.7.19	The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.
ACT.7.20	In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:
ACT.7.21	And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.
ACT.7.22	And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
ACT.7.23	And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
ACT.7.24	And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:
ACT.7.25	For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.
ACT.7.26	And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?
ACT.7.27	But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
ACT.7.28	Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?
ACT.7.29	Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.
ACT.7.30	And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.
ACT.7.31	When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,
ACT.7.32	Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.
ACT.7.33	Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.
ACT.7.34	I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
ACT.7.35	This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.
ACT.7.36	He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
ACT.7.37	This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.
ACT.7.38	This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:
ACT.7.39	To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,
ACT.7.40	Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
ACT.7.41	And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
ACT.7.42	Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?
ACT.7.43	Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
ACT.7.44	Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.
ACT.7.45	Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;
ACT.7.46	Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.
ACT.7.47	But Solomon built him an house.
ACT.7.48	Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,
ACT.7.49	Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?
ACT.7.50	Hath not my hand made all these things?
ACT.7.51	Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.
ACT.7.52	Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:
ACT.7.53	Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.
ACT.7.54	When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.
ACT.7.55	But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
ACT.7.56	And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
ACT.7.57	Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,
ACT.7.58	And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.
ACT.7.59	And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
ACT.7.60	And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
ACT.8.1	And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
ACT.8.2	And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.
ACT.8.3	As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.
ACT.8.4	Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.
ACT.8.5	Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.
ACT.8.6	And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
ACT.8.7	For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
ACT.8.8	And there was great joy in that city.
ACT.8.9	But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
ACT.8.10	To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.
ACT.8.11	And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.
ACT.8.12	But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
ACT.8.13	Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
ACT.8.14	Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
ACT.8.15	Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:
ACT.8.16	(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
ACT.8.17	Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
ACT.8.18	And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,
ACT.8.19	Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.
ACT.8.20	But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
ACT.8.21	Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
ACT.8.22	Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.
ACT.8.23	For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.
ACT.8.24	Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.
ACT.8.25	And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
ACT.8.26	And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.
ACT.8.27	And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,
ACT.8.28	Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.
ACT.8.29	Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.
ACT.8.30	And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
ACT.8.31	And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
ACT.8.32	The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
ACT.8.33	In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.
ACT.8.34	And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?
ACT.8.35	Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.
ACT.8.36	And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
ACT.8.37	And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
ACT.8.38	And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
ACT.8.39	And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
ACT.8.40	But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
ACT.9.1	And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,
ACT.9.2	And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
ACT.9.3	And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:
ACT.9.4	And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, 
ACT.9.5	And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, 
ACT.9.6	And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, 
ACT.9.7	And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.
ACT.9.8	And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.
ACT.9.9	And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
ACT.9.10	And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, 
ACT.9.11	And the Lord said unto him, 
ACT.9.13	Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:
ACT.9.14	And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.
ACT.9.15	But the Lord said unto him, 
ACT.9.17	And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.
ACT.9.18	And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.
ACT.9.19	And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.
ACT.9.20	And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.
ACT.9.21	But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?
ACT.9.22	But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.
ACT.9.23	And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:
ACT.9.24	But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
ACT.9.25	Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.
ACT.9.26	And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.
ACT.9.27	But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
ACT.9.28	And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
ACT.9.29	And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.
ACT.9.30	Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
ACT.9.31	Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.
ACT.9.32	And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.
ACT.9.33	And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.
ACT.9.34	And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.
ACT.9.35	And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.
ACT.9.36	Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.
ACT.9.37	And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.
ACT.9.38	And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.
ACT.9.39	Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.
ACT.9.40	But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
ACT.9.41	And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.
ACT.9.42	And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.
ACT.9.43	And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
ACT.10.1	There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,
ACT.10.2	A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.
ACT.10.3	He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.
ACT.10.4	And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.
ACT.10.5	And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:
ACT.10.6	He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.
ACT.10.7	And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;
ACT.10.8	And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.
ACT.10.9	On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:
ACT.10.10	And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,
ACT.10.11	And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:
ACT.10.12	Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
ACT.10.13	And there came a voice to him, 
ACT.10.14	But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.
ACT.10.15	And the voice spake unto him again the second time, 
ACT.10.16	This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
ACT.10.17	Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,
ACT.10.18	And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.
ACT.10.19	While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.
ACT.10.20	Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.
ACT.10.21	Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?
ACT.10.22	And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.
ACT.10.23	Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
ACT.10.24	And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.
ACT.10.25	And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.
ACT.10.26	But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
ACT.10.27	And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.
ACT.10.28	And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
ACT.10.29	Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?
ACT.10.30	And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
ACT.10.31	And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.
ACT.10.32	Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.
ACT.10.33	Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.
ACT.10.34	Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:
ACT.10.35	But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.
ACT.10.36	The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)
ACT.10.37	That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
ACT.10.38	How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.
ACT.10.39	And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:
ACT.10.40	Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;
ACT.10.41	Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.
ACT.10.42	And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.
ACT.10.43	To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.
ACT.10.44	While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.
ACT.10.45	And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.
ACT.10.46	For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,
ACT.10.47	Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?
ACT.10.48	And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.
ACT.11.1	And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
ACT.11.2	And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,
ACT.11.3	Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.
ACT.11.4	But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,
ACT.11.5	I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:
ACT.11.6	Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
ACT.11.7	And I heard a voice saying unto me, 
ACT.11.8	But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.
ACT.11.9	But the voice answered me again from heaven, 
ACT.11.10	And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
ACT.11.11	And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.
ACT.11.12	And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:
ACT.11.13	And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;
ACT.11.14	Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.
ACT.11.15	And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.
ACT.11.16	Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, 
ACT.11.17	Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?
ACT.11.18	When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.
ACT.11.19	Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.
ACT.11.20	And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus.
ACT.11.21	And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.
ACT.11.22	Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.
ACT.11.23	Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.
ACT.11.24	For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.
ACT.11.25	Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:
ACT.11.26	And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.
ACT.11.27	And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
ACT.11.28	And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.
ACT.11.29	Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:
ACT.11.30	Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
ACT.12.1	Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.
ACT.12.2	And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
ACT.12.3	And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
ACT.12.4	And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.
ACT.12.5	Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.
ACT.12.6	And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.
ACT.12.7	And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.
ACT.12.8	And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.
ACT.12.9	And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.
ACT.12.10	When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.
ACT.12.11	And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
ACT.12.12	And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.
ACT.12.13	And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.
ACT.12.14	And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.
ACT.12.15	And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.
ACT.12.16	But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.
ACT.12.17	But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.
ACT.12.18	Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.
ACT.12.19	And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.
ACT.12.20	And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.
ACT.12.21	And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.
ACT.12.22	And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.
ACT.12.23	And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.
ACT.12.24	But the word of God grew and multiplied.
ACT.12.25	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.
ACT.13.1	Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
ACT.13.2	As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.
ACT.13.3	And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
ACT.13.4	So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
ACT.13.5	And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.
ACT.13.6	And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar–jesus:
ACT.13.7	Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.
ACT.13.8	But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.
ACT.13.9	Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,
ACT.13.10	And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
ACT.13.11	And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
ACT.13.12	Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.
ACT.13.13	Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.
ACT.13.14	But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.
ACT.13.15	And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.
ACT.13.16	Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.
ACT.13.17	The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.
ACT.13.18	And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.
ACT.13.19	And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land to them by lot.
ACT.13.20	And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.
ACT.13.21	And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.
ACT.13.22	And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.
ACT.13.23	Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:
ACT.13.24	When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
ACT.13.25	And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.
ACT.13.26	Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
ACT.13.27	For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.
ACT.13.28	And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.
ACT.13.29	And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.
ACT.13.30	But God raised him from the dead:
ACT.13.31	And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.
ACT.13.32	And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,
ACT.13.33	God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
ACT.13.34	And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.
ACT.13.35	Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
ACT.13.36	For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:
ACT.13.37	But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.
ACT.13.38	Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:
ACT.13.39	And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
ACT.13.40	Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;
ACT.13.41	Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.
ACT.13.42	And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.
ACT.13.43	Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
ACT.13.44	And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.
ACT.13.45	But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.
ACT.13.46	Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
ACT.13.47	For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.
ACT.13.48	And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
ACT.13.49	And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.
ACT.13.50	But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.
ACT.13.51	But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.
ACT.13.52	And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.
ACT.14.1	And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.
ACT.14.2	But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.
ACT.14.3	Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
ACT.14.4	But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
ACT.14.5	And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,
ACT.14.6	They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:
ACT.14.7	And there they preached the gospel.
ACT.14.8	And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:
ACT.14.9	The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
ACT.14.10	Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.
ACT.14.11	And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.
ACT.14.12	And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.
ACT.14.13	Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.
ACT.14.14	Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,
ACT.14.15	And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:
ACT.14.16	Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
ACT.14.17	Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
ACT.14.18	And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.
ACT.14.19	And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.
ACT.14.20	Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
ACT.14.21	And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,
ACT.14.22	Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.
ACT.14.23	And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.
ACT.14.24	And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
ACT.14.25	And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:
ACT.14.26	And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.
ACT.14.27	And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.
ACT.14.28	And there they abode long time with the disciples.
ACT.15.1	And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
ACT.15.2	When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.
ACT.15.3	And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.
ACT.15.4	And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.
ACT.15.5	But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.
ACT.15.6	And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.
ACT.15.7	And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
ACT.15.8	And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;
ACT.15.9	And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
ACT.15.10	Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
ACT.15.11	But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.
ACT.15.12	Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.
ACT.15.13	And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:
ACT.15.14	Simon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
ACT.15.15	And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
ACT.15.16	After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:
ACT.15.17	That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.
ACT.15.18	Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.
ACT.15.19	Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:
ACT.15.20	But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.
ACT.15.21	For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.
ACT.15.22	Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:
ACT.15.23	And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:
ACT.15.24	Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:
ACT.15.25	It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
ACT.15.26	Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
ACT.15.27	We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.
ACT.15.28	For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;
ACT.15.29	That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.
ACT.15.30	So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:
ACT.15.31	Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.
ACT.15.32	And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.
ACT.15.33	And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.
ACT.15.34	Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
ACT.15.35	Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
ACT.15.36	And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.
ACT.15.37	And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.
ACT.15.38	But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.
ACT.15.39	And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;
ACT.15.40	And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.
ACT.15.41	And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
ACT.16.1	Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:
ACT.16.2	Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.
ACT.16.3	Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.
ACT.16.4	And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.
ACT.16.5	And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
ACT.16.6	Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,
ACT.16.7	After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.
ACT.16.8	And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
ACT.16.9	And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.
ACT.16.10	And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.
ACT.16.11	Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;
ACT.16.12	And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.
ACT.16.13	And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.
ACT.16.14	And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.
ACT.16.15	And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.
ACT.16.16	And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:
ACT.16.17	The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.
ACT.16.18	And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.
ACT.16.19	And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,
ACT.16.20	And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
ACT.16.21	And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.
ACT.16.22	And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.
ACT.16.23	And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:
ACT.16.24	Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
ACT.16.25	And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.
ACT.16.26	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.
ACT.16.27	And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.
ACT.16.28	But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
ACT.16.29	Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,
ACT.16.30	And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
ACT.16.31	And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
ACT.16.32	And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.
ACT.16.33	And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.
ACT.16.34	And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.
ACT.16.35	And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.
ACT.16.36	And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.
ACT.16.37	But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.
ACT.16.38	And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.
ACT.16.39	And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.
ACT.16.40	And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
ACT.17.1	Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:
ACT.17.2	And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,
ACT.17.3	Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.
ACT.17.4	And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.
ACT.17.5	But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.
ACT.17.6	And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;
ACT.17.7	Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.
ACT.17.8	And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.
ACT.17.9	And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.
ACT.17.10	And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.
ACT.17.11	These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.
ACT.17.12	Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.
ACT.17.13	But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.
ACT.17.14	And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timothy abode there still.
ACT.17.15	And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy for to come to him with all speed, they departed.
ACT.17.16	Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.
ACT.17.17	Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.
ACT.17.18	Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.
ACT.17.19	And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?
ACT.17.20	For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
ACT.17.21	(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)
ACT.17.22	Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.
ACT.17.23	For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.
ACT.17.24	God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
ACT.17.25	Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
ACT.17.26	And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
ACT.17.27	That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:
ACT.17.28	For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
ACT.17.29	Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.
ACT.17.30	And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:
ACT.17.31	Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.
ACT.17.32	And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.
ACT.17.33	So Paul departed from among them.
ACT.17.34	Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
ACT.18.1	After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;
ACT.18.2	And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.
ACT.18.3	And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.
ACT.18.4	And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
ACT.18.5	And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.
ACT.18.6	And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.
ACT.18.7	And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.
ACT.18.8	And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.
ACT.18.9	Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, 
ACT.18.11	And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
ACT.18.12	And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
ACT.18.13	Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.
ACT.18.14	And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:
ACT.18.15	But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.
ACT.18.16	And he drave them from the judgment seat.
ACT.18.17	Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.
ACT.18.18	And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.
ACT.18.19	And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
ACT.18.20	When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;
ACT.18.21	But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.
ACT.18.22	And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
ACT.18.23	And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
ACT.18.24	And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
ACT.18.25	This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.
ACT.18.26	And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.
ACT.18.27	And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:
ACT.18.28	For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
ACT.19.1	And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,
ACT.19.2	He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.
ACT.19.3	And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.
ACT.19.4	Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.
ACT.19.5	When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
ACT.19.6	And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
ACT.19.7	And all the men were about twelve.
ACT.19.8	And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.
ACT.19.9	But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
ACT.19.10	And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
ACT.19.11	And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:
ACT.19.12	So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.
ACT.19.13	Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.
ACT.19.14	And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.
ACT.19.15	And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?
ACT.19.16	And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
ACT.19.17	And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
ACT.19.18	And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.
ACT.19.19	Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
ACT.19.20	So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
ACT.19.21	After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
ACT.19.22	So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.
ACT.19.23	And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.
ACT.19.24	For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;
ACT.19.25	Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.
ACT.19.26	Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:
ACT.19.27	So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.
ACT.19.28	And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
ACT.19.29	And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.
ACT.19.30	And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.
ACT.19.31	And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.
ACT.19.32	Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.
ACT.19.33	And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.
ACT.19.34	But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
ACT.19.35	And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?
ACT.19.36	Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.
ACT.19.37	For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.
ACT.19.38	Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.
ACT.19.39	But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
ACT.19.40	For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.
ACT.19.41	And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
ACT.20.1	And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.
ACT.20.2	And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,
ACT.20.3	And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.
ACT.20.4	And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.
ACT.20.5	These going before tarried for us at Troas.
ACT.20.6	And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.
ACT.20.7	And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.
ACT.20.8	And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.
ACT.20.9	And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.
ACT.20.10	And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.
ACT.20.11	When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.
ACT.20.12	And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
ACT.20.13	And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.
ACT.20.14	And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.
ACT.20.15	And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.
ACT.20.16	For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
ACT.20.17	And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
ACT.20.18	And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,
ACT.20.19	Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:
ACT.20.20	And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,
ACT.20.21	Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
ACT.20.22	And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:
ACT.20.23	Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.
ACT.20.24	But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
ACT.20.25	And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.
ACT.20.26	Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.
ACT.20.27	For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
ACT.20.28	Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
ACT.20.29	For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
ACT.20.30	Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
ACT.20.31	Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
ACT.20.32	And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.
ACT.20.33	I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.
ACT.20.34	Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
ACT.20.35	I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, 
ACT.20.36	And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.
ACT.20.37	And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,
ACT.20.38	Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.
ACT.21.1	And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:
ACT.21.2	And finding a ship sailing over unto Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.
ACT.21.3	Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.
ACT.21.4	And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.
ACT.21.5	And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.
ACT.21.6	And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.
ACT.21.7	And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.
ACT.21.8	And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.
ACT.21.9	And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.
ACT.21.10	And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.
ACT.21.11	And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
ACT.21.12	And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
ACT.21.13	Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
ACT.21.14	And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
ACT.21.15	And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.
ACT.21.16	There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
ACT.21.17	And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
ACT.21.18	And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.
ACT.21.19	And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.
ACT.21.20	And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:
ACT.21.21	And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.
ACT.21.22	What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.
ACT.21.23	Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;
ACT.21.24	Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.
ACT.21.25	As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.
ACT.21.26	Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.
ACT.21.27	And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,
ACT.21.28	Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.
ACT.21.29	(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
ACT.21.30	And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.
ACT.21.31	And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
ACT.21.32	Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.
ACT.21.33	Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
ACT.21.34	And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
ACT.21.35	And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.
ACT.21.36	For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.
ACT.21.37	And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?
ACT.21.38	Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?
ACT.21.39	But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.
ACT.21.40	And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,
ACT.22.1	Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you.
ACT.22.2	(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
ACT.22.3	I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.
ACT.22.4	And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
ACT.22.5	As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.
ACT.22.6	And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
ACT.22.7	And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, 
ACT.22.8	And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, 
ACT.22.9	And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
ACT.22.10	And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, 
ACT.22.11	And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
ACT.22.12	And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,
ACT.22.13	Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.
ACT.22.14	And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.
ACT.22.15	For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
ACT.22.16	And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
ACT.22.17	And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;
ACT.22.18	And saw him saying unto me, 
ACT.22.19	And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
ACT.22.20	And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
ACT.22.21	And he said unto me, 
ACT.22.22	And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
ACT.22.23	And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,
ACT.22.24	The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.
ACT.22.25	And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
ACT.22.26	When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.
ACT.22.27	Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.
ACT.22.28	And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.
ACT.22.29	Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
ACT.22.30	On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
ACT.23.1	And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
ACT.23.2	And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
ACT.23.3	Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
ACT.23.4	And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?
ACT.23.5	Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
ACT.23.6	But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
ACT.23.7	And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
ACT.23.8	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
ACT.23.9	And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
ACT.23.10	And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.
ACT.23.11	And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, 
ACT.23.12	And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
ACT.23.13	And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
ACT.23.14	And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.
ACT.23.15	Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.
ACT.23.16	And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.
ACT.23.17	Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.
ACT.23.18	So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.
ACT.23.19	Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?
ACT.23.20	And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.
ACT.23.21	But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.
ACT.23.22	So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.
ACT.23.23	And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;
ACT.23.24	And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.
ACT.23.25	And he wrote a letter after this manner:
ACT.23.26	Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.
ACT.23.27	This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.
ACT.23.28	And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:
ACT.23.29	Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
ACT.23.30	And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.
ACT.23.31	Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.
ACT.23.32	On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:
ACT.23.33	Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
ACT.23.34	And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;
ACT.23.35	I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.
ACT.24.1	And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.
ACT.24.2	And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,
ACT.24.3	We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
ACT.24.4	Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.
ACT.24.5	For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
ACT.24.6	Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.
ACT.24.7	But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,
ACT.24.8	Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.
ACT.24.9	And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
ACT.24.10	Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:
ACT.24.11	Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.
ACT.24.12	And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:
ACT.24.13	Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
ACT.24.14	But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:
ACT.24.15	And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
ACT.24.16	And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men.
ACT.24.17	Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
ACT.24.18	Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.
ACT.24.19	Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.
ACT.24.20	Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
ACT.24.21	Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.
ACT.24.22	And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.
ACT.24.23	And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.
ACT.24.24	And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
ACT.24.25	And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.
ACT.24.26	He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.
ACT.24.27	But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
ACT.25.1	Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
ACT.25.2	Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,
ACT.25.3	And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.
ACT.25.4	But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.
ACT.25.5	Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.
ACT.25.6	And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.
ACT.25.7	And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.
ACT.25.8	While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.
ACT.25.9	But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
ACT.25.10	Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.
ACT.25.11	For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.
ACT.25.12	Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.
ACT.25.13	And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.
ACT.25.14	And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:
ACT.25.15	About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.
ACT.25.16	To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.
ACT.25.17	Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
ACT.25.18	Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:
ACT.25.19	But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
ACT.25.20	And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.
ACT.25.21	But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.
ACT.25.22	Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.
ACT.25.23	And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.
ACT.25.24	And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
ACT.25.25	But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.
ACT.25.26	Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.
ACT.25.27	For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.
ACT.26.1	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
ACT.26.2	I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:
ACT.26.3	Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
ACT.26.4	My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
ACT.26.5	Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
ACT.26.6	And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:
ACT.26.7	Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.
ACT.26.8	Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?
ACT.26.9	I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
ACT.26.10	Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.
ACT.26.11	And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.
ACT.26.12	Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
ACT.26.13	At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.
ACT.26.14	And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, 
ACT.26.15	And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, 
ACT.26.19	Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
ACT.26.20	But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.
ACT.26.21	For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.
ACT.26.22	Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:
ACT.26.23	That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.
ACT.26.24	And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.
ACT.26.25	But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
ACT.26.26	For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.
ACT.26.27	King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
ACT.26.28	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
ACT.26.29	And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
ACT.26.30	And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:
ACT.26.31	And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
ACT.26.32	Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
ACT.27.1	And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.
ACT.27.2	And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
ACT.27.3	And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.
ACT.27.4	And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
ACT.27.5	And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
ACT.27.6	And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.
ACT.27.7	And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;
ACT.27.8	And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.
ACT.27.9	Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,
ACT.27.10	And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.
ACT.27.11	Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.
ACT.27.12	And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.
ACT.27.13	And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.
ACT.27.14	But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.
ACT.27.15	And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.
ACT.27.16	And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:
ACT.27.17	Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.
ACT.27.18	And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;
ACT.27.19	And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.
ACT.27.20	And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.
ACT.27.21	But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.
ACT.27.22	And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.
ACT.27.23	For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
ACT.27.24	Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.
ACT.27.25	Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.
ACT.27.26	Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
ACT.27.27	But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;
ACT.27.28	And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.
ACT.27.29	Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.
ACT.27.30	And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,
ACT.27.31	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
ACT.27.32	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
ACT.27.33	And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.
ACT.27.34	Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.
ACT.27.35	And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.
ACT.27.36	Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.
ACT.27.37	And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
ACT.27.38	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.
ACT.27.39	And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.
ACT.27.40	And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.
ACT.27.41	And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.
ACT.27.42	And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.
ACT.27.43	But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:
ACT.27.44	And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.
ACT.28.1	And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.
ACT.28.2	And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
ACT.28.3	And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
ACT.28.4	And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.
ACT.28.5	And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
ACT.28.6	Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
ACT.28.7	In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.
ACT.28.8	And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
ACT.28.9	So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:
ACT.28.10	Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.
ACT.28.11	And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
ACT.28.12	And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.
ACT.28.13	And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:
ACT.28.14	Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.
ACT.28.15	And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
ACT.28.16	And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.
ACT.28.17	And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
ACT.28.18	Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.
ACT.28.19	But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
ACT.28.20	For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
ACT.28.21	And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.
ACT.28.22	But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
ACT.28.23	And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.
ACT.28.24	And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
ACT.28.25	And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,
ACT.28.26	Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:
ACT.28.27	For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
ACT.28.28	Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.
ACT.28.29	And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.
ACT.28.30	And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,
ACT.28.31	Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
ROM.1.1	Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
ROM.1.2	(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
ROM.1.3	Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;
ROM.1.4	And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
ROM.1.5	By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:
ROM.1.6	Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:
ROM.1.7	To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.1.8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
ROM.1.9	For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;
ROM.1.10	Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.
ROM.1.11	For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
ROM.1.12	That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
ROM.1.13	Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
ROM.1.14	I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.
ROM.1.15	So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.
ROM.1.16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
ROM.1.17	For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
ROM.1.18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
ROM.1.19	Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.
ROM.1.20	For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
ROM.1.21	Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
ROM.1.22	Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
ROM.1.23	And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
ROM.1.24	Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:
ROM.1.25	Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
ROM.1.26	For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
ROM.1.27	And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.
ROM.1.28	And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
ROM.1.29	Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
ROM.1.30	Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
ROM.1.31	Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
ROM.1.32	Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
ROM.2.1	Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
ROM.2.2	But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.
ROM.2.3	And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
ROM.2.4	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
ROM.2.5	But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
ROM.2.6	Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
ROM.2.7	To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
ROM.2.8	But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
ROM.2.9	Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
ROM.2.10	But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
ROM.2.11	For there is no respect of persons with God.
ROM.2.12	For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
ROM.2.13	(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
ROM.2.14	For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
ROM.2.15	Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
ROM.2.16	In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.
ROM.2.17	Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,
ROM.2.18	And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
ROM.2.19	And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,
ROM.2.20	An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
ROM.2.21	Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
ROM.2.22	Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
ROM.2.23	Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?
ROM.2.24	For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
ROM.2.25	For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
ROM.2.26	Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
ROM.2.27	And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?
ROM.2.28	For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
ROM.2.29	But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
ROM.3.1	What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?
ROM.3.2	Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
ROM.3.3	For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
ROM.3.4	God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
ROM.3.5	But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)
ROM.3.6	God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
ROM.3.7	For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
ROM.3.8	And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.
ROM.3.9	What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
ROM.3.10	As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
ROM.3.11	There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
ROM.3.12	They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
ROM.3.13	Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:
ROM.3.14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
ROM.3.15	Their feet are swift to shed blood:
ROM.3.16	Destruction and misery are in their ways:
ROM.3.17	And the way of peace have they not known:
ROM.3.18	There is no fear of God before their eyes.
ROM.3.19	Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
ROM.3.20	Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
ROM.3.21	But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
ROM.3.22	Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
ROM.3.23	For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
ROM.3.24	Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
ROM.3.25	Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
ROM.3.26	To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
ROM.3.27	Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
ROM.3.28	Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
ROM.3.29	Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
ROM.3.30	Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
ROM.3.31	Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
ROM.4.1	What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
ROM.4.2	For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.
ROM.4.3	For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
ROM.4.4	Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
ROM.4.5	But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
ROM.4.6	Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
ROM.4.7	Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
ROM.4.8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
ROM.4.9	Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
ROM.4.10	How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
ROM.4.11	And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:
ROM.4.12	And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.
ROM.4.13	For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
ROM.4.14	For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
ROM.4.15	Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.
ROM.4.16	Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
ROM.4.17	(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
ROM.4.18	Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.
ROM.4.19	And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:
ROM.4.20	He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
ROM.4.21	And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
ROM.4.22	And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
ROM.4.23	Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
ROM.4.24	But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
ROM.4.25	Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
ROM.5.1	Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
ROM.5.2	By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
ROM.5.3	And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
ROM.5.4	And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
ROM.5.5	And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
ROM.5.6	For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
ROM.5.7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
ROM.5.8	But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
ROM.5.9	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
ROM.5.10	For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
ROM.5.11	And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.
ROM.5.12	Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
ROM.5.13	(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
ROM.5.14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
ROM.5.15	But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
ROM.5.16	And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.
ROM.5.17	For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)
ROM.5.18	Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.
ROM.5.19	For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
ROM.5.20	Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
ROM.5.21	That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.6.1	What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
ROM.6.2	God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
ROM.6.3	Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
ROM.6.4	Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
ROM.6.5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:
ROM.6.6	Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
ROM.6.7	For he that is dead is freed from sin.
ROM.6.8	Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:
ROM.6.9	Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
ROM.6.10	For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
ROM.6.11	Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.6.12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
ROM.6.13	Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.
ROM.6.14	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
ROM.6.15	What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
ROM.6.16	Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
ROM.6.17	But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
ROM.6.18	Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
ROM.6.19	I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
ROM.6.20	For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
ROM.6.21	What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
ROM.6.22	But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
ROM.6.23	For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.7.1	Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?
ROM.7.2	For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.
ROM.7.3	So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.
ROM.7.4	Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
ROM.7.5	For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
ROM.7.6	But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.
ROM.7.7	What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
ROM.7.8	But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.
ROM.7.9	For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
ROM.7.10	And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.
ROM.7.11	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.
ROM.7.12	Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
ROM.7.13	Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
ROM.7.14	For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
ROM.7.15	For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
ROM.7.16	If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.
ROM.7.17	Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
ROM.7.18	For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.
ROM.7.19	For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
ROM.7.20	Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
ROM.7.21	I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.
ROM.7.22	For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
ROM.7.23	But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
ROM.7.24	O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
ROM.7.25	I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
ROM.8.1	There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
ROM.8.2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
ROM.8.3	For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
ROM.8.4	That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
ROM.8.5	For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
ROM.8.6	For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.
ROM.8.7	Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
ROM.8.8	So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
ROM.8.9	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
ROM.8.10	And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
ROM.8.11	But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
ROM.8.12	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
ROM.8.13	For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
ROM.8.14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
ROM.8.15	For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
ROM.8.16	The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
ROM.8.17	And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
ROM.8.18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
ROM.8.19	For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
ROM.8.20	For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,
ROM.8.21	Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
ROM.8.22	For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
ROM.8.23	And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
ROM.8.24	For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
ROM.8.25	But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.
ROM.8.26	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
ROM.8.27	And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
ROM.8.28	And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.
ROM.8.29	For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
ROM.8.30	Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
ROM.8.31	What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
ROM.8.32	He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
ROM.8.33	Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.
ROM.8.34	Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
ROM.8.35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
ROM.8.36	As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
ROM.8.37	Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
ROM.8.38	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
ROM.8.39	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.9.1	I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,
ROM.9.2	That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
ROM.9.3	For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
ROM.9.4	Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;
ROM.9.5	Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
ROM.9.6	Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:
ROM.9.7	Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
ROM.9.8	That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.
ROM.9.9	For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.
ROM.9.10	And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;
ROM.9.11	(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)
ROM.9.12	It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
ROM.9.13	As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
ROM.9.14	What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
ROM.9.15	For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
ROM.9.16	So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
ROM.9.17	For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
ROM.9.18	Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.
ROM.9.19	Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?
ROM.9.20	Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?
ROM.9.21	Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
ROM.9.22	What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:
ROM.9.23	And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,
ROM.9.24	Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?
ROM.9.25	As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
ROM.9.26	And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.
ROM.9.27	Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
ROM.9.28	For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.
ROM.9.29	And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and been made like unto Gomorrha.
ROM.9.30	What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.
ROM.9.31	But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
ROM.9.32	Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
ROM.9.33	As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
ROM.10.1	Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.
ROM.10.2	For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
ROM.10.3	For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
ROM.10.4	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
ROM.10.5	For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.
ROM.10.6	But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)
ROM.10.7	Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)
ROM.10.8	But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;
ROM.10.9	That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
ROM.10.10	For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
ROM.10.11	For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
ROM.10.12	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
ROM.10.13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
ROM.10.14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
ROM.10.15	And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
ROM.10.16	But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
ROM.10.17	So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
ROM.10.18	But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
ROM.10.19	But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.
ROM.10.20	But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.
ROM.10.21	But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
ROM.11.1	I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
ROM.11.2	God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,
ROM.11.3	Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
ROM.11.4	But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.
ROM.11.5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
ROM.11.6	And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
ROM.11.7	What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded
ROM.11.8	(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.
ROM.11.9	And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:
ROM.11.10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.
ROM.11.11	I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.
ROM.11.12	Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
ROM.11.13	For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:
ROM.11.14	If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.
ROM.11.15	For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?
ROM.11.16	For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.
ROM.11.17	And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
ROM.11.18	Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
ROM.11.19	Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
ROM.11.20	Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
ROM.11.21	For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.
ROM.11.22	Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
ROM.11.23	And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
ROM.11.24	For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
ROM.11.25	For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
ROM.11.26	And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
ROM.11.27	For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.
ROM.11.28	As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.
ROM.11.29	For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
ROM.11.30	For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:
ROM.11.31	Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
ROM.11.32	For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.
ROM.11.33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
ROM.11.34	For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?
ROM.11.35	Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
ROM.11.36	For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.
ROM.12.1	I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
ROM.12.2	And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
ROM.12.3	For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
ROM.12.4	For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
ROM.12.5	So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
ROM.12.6	Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
ROM.12.7	Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;
ROM.12.8	Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.
ROM.12.9	Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
ROM.12.10	Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
ROM.12.11	Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
ROM.12.12	Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
ROM.12.13	Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
ROM.12.14	Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
ROM.12.15	Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
ROM.12.16	Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.
ROM.12.17	Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
ROM.12.18	If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.
ROM.12.19	Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.
ROM.12.20	Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.
ROM.12.21	Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
ROM.13.1	Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
ROM.13.2	Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
ROM.13.3	For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:
ROM.13.4	For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.
ROM.13.5	Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
ROM.13.6	For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.
ROM.13.7	Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
ROM.13.8	Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
ROM.13.9	For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
ROM.13.10	Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
ROM.13.11	And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
ROM.13.12	The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
ROM.13.13	Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.
ROM.13.14	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.
ROM.14.1	Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.
ROM.14.2	For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.
ROM.14.3	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.
ROM.14.4	Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.
ROM.14.5	One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
ROM.14.6	He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
ROM.14.7	For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
ROM.14.8	For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.
ROM.14.9	For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.
ROM.14.10	But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
ROM.14.11	For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
ROM.14.12	So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
ROM.14.13	Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.
ROM.14.14	I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
ROM.14.15	But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.
ROM.14.16	Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
ROM.14.17	For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
ROM.14.18	For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.
ROM.14.19	Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.
ROM.14.20	For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.
ROM.14.21	It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
ROM.14.22	Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
ROM.14.23	And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
ROM.15.1	We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
ROM.15.2	Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.
ROM.15.3	For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.
ROM.15.4	For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
ROM.15.5	Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:
ROM.15.6	That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.15.7	Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.
ROM.15.8	Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:
ROM.15.9	And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.
ROM.15.10	And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
ROM.15.11	And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.
ROM.15.12	And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.
ROM.15.13	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.
ROM.15.14	And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
ROM.15.15	Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,
ROM.15.16	That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
ROM.15.17	I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.
ROM.15.18	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,
ROM.15.19	Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
ROM.15.20	Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:
ROM.15.21	But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.
ROM.15.22	For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
ROM.15.23	But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;
ROM.15.24	Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.
ROM.15.25	But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
ROM.15.26	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.
ROM.15.27	It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.
ROM.15.28	When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.
ROM.15.29	And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
ROM.15.30	Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;
ROM.15.31	That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;
ROM.15.32	That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.
ROM.15.33	Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
ROM.16.1	I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:
ROM.16.2	That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.
ROM.16.3	Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:
ROM.16.4	Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.
ROM.16.5	Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Asia unto Christ.
ROM.16.6	Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.
ROM.16.7	Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.
ROM.16.8	Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.
ROM.16.9	Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
ROM.16.10	Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household.
ROM.16.11	Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.
ROM.16.12	Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.
ROM.16.13	Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
ROM.16.14	Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.
ROM.16.15	Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.
ROM.16.16	Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.
ROM.16.17	Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.
ROM.16.18	For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.
ROM.16.19	For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.
ROM.16.20	And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
ROM.16.21	Timothy my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.
ROM.16.22	I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.
ROM.16.23	Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.
ROM.16.24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
ROM.16.25	Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,
ROM.16.26	But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:
ROM.16.27	To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.
1CO.1.1	Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,
1CO.1.2	Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:
1CO.1.3	Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.1.4	I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;
1CO.1.5	That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;
1CO.1.6	Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
1CO.1.7	So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
1CO.1.8	Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.1.9	God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
1CO.1.10	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
1CO.1.11	For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
1CO.1.12	Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
1CO.1.13	Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
1CO.1.14	I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
1CO.1.15	Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
1CO.1.16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
1CO.1.17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.
1CO.1.18	For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
1CO.1.19	For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
1CO.1.20	Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
1CO.1.21	For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
1CO.1.22	For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
1CO.1.23	But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;
1CO.1.24	But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
1CO.1.25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
1CO.1.26	For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:
1CO.1.27	But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
1CO.1.28	And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:
1CO.1.29	That no flesh should glory in his presence.
1CO.1.30	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
1CO.1.31	That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
1CO.2.1	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.
1CO.2.2	For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
1CO.2.3	And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
1CO.2.4	And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
1CO.2.5	That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
1CO.2.6	Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:
1CO.2.7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:
1CO.2.8	Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
1CO.2.9	But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.
1CO.2.10	But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
1CO.2.11	For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
1CO.2.12	Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
1CO.2.13	Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
1CO.2.14	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
1CO.2.15	But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
1CO.2.16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
1CO.3.1	And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.
1CO.3.2	I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.
1CO.3.3	For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?
1CO.3.4	For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?
1CO.3.5	Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?
1CO.3.6	I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
1CO.3.7	So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
1CO.3.8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
1CO.3.9	For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.
1CO.3.10	According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.
1CO.3.11	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
1CO.3.12	Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
1CO.3.13	Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
1CO.3.14	If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
1CO.3.15	If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.
1CO.3.16	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
1CO.3.17	If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.
1CO.3.18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
1CO.3.19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.
1CO.3.20	And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
1CO.3.21	Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
1CO.3.22	Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;
1CO.3.23	And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
1CO.4.1	Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
1CO.4.2	Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
1CO.4.3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.
1CO.4.4	For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
1CO.4.5	Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.
1CO.4.6	And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.
1CO.4.7	For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?
1CO.4.8	Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
1CO.4.9	For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.
1CO.4.10	We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.
1CO.4.11	Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;
1CO.4.12	And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:
1CO.4.13	Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.
1CO.4.14	I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.
1CO.4.15	For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
1CO.4.16	Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.
1CO.4.17	For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.
1CO.4.18	Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
1CO.4.19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.
1CO.4.20	For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
1CO.4.21	What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?
1CO.5.1	It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.
1CO.5.2	And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.
1CO.5.3	For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,
1CO.5.4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
1CO.5.5	To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
1CO.5.6	Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
1CO.5.7	Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:
1CO.5.8	Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
1CO.5.9	I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
1CO.5.10	Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
1CO.5.11	But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.
1CO.5.12	For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?
1CO.5.13	But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
1CO.6.1	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?
1CO.6.2	Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
1CO.6.3	Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
1CO.6.4	If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.
1CO.6.5	I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?
1CO.6.6	But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
1CO.6.7	Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?
1CO.6.8	Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.
1CO.6.9	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
1CO.6.10	Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
1CO.6.11	And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
1CO.6.12	All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
1CO.6.13	Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
1CO.6.14	And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.
1CO.6.15	Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.
1CO.6.16	What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
1CO.6.17	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
1CO.6.18	Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
1CO.6.19	What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
1CO.6.20	For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
1CO.7.1	Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
1CO.7.2	Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.
1CO.7.3	Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
1CO.7.4	The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.
1CO.7.5	Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.
1CO.7.6	But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.
1CO.7.7	For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.
1CO.7.8	I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.
1CO.7.9	But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
1CO.7.10	And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:
1CO.7.11	But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.
1CO.7.12	But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
1CO.7.13	And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
1CO.7.14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.
1CO.7.15	But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.
1CO.7.16	For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?
1CO.7.17	But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.
1CO.7.18	Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
1CO.7.19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
1CO.7.20	Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
1CO.7.21	Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.
1CO.7.22	For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.
1CO.7.23	Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
1CO.7.24	Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.
1CO.7.25	Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
1CO.7.26	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.
1CO.7.27	Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
1CO.7.28	But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.
1CO.7.29	But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;
1CO.7.30	And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;
1CO.7.31	And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.
1CO.7.32	But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:
1CO.7.33	But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.
1CO.7.34	There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
1CO.7.35	And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
1CO.7.36	But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.
1CO.7.37	Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.
1CO.7.38	So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.
1CO.7.39	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
1CO.7.40	But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.
1CO.8.1	Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.
1CO.8.2	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
1CO.8.3	But if any man love God, the same is known of him.
1CO.8.4	As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.
1CO.8.5	For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)
1CO.8.6	But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.
1CO.8.7	Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
1CO.8.8	But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.
1CO.8.9	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.
1CO.8.10	For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;
1CO.8.11	And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?
1CO.8.12	But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
1CO.8.13	Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.
1CO.9.1	Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?
1CO.9.2	If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.
1CO.9.3	Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,
1CO.9.4	Have we not power to eat and to drink?
1CO.9.5	Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
1CO.9.6	Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?
1CO.9.7	Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
1CO.9.8	Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
1CO.9.9	For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?
1CO.9.10	Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.
1CO.9.11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
1CO.9.12	If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
1CO.9.13	Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
1CO.9.14	Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
1CO.9.15	But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
1CO.9.16	For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!
1CO.9.17	For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.
1CO.9.18	What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.
1CO.9.19	For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.
1CO.9.20	And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;
1CO.9.21	To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.
1CO.9.22	To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.
1CO.9.23	And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.
1CO.9.24	Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
1CO.9.25	And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
1CO.9.26	I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:
1CO.9.27	But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
1CO.10.1	Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
1CO.10.2	And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
1CO.10.3	And did all eat the same spiritual meat;
1CO.10.4	And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.
1CO.10.5	But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
1CO.10.6	Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
1CO.10.7	Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
1CO.10.8	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
1CO.10.9	Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.
1CO.10.10	Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.
1CO.10.11	Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.
1CO.10.12	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
1CO.10.13	There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.
1CO.10.14	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
1CO.10.15	I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
1CO.10.16	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
1CO.10.17	For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.
1CO.10.18	Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
1CO.10.19	What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?
1CO.10.20	But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.
1CO.10.21	Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.
1CO.10.22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
1CO.10.23	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.
1CO.10.24	Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.
1CO.10.25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:
1CO.10.26	For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.
1CO.10.27	If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.
1CO.10.28	But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:
1CO.10.29	Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?
1CO.10.30	For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
1CO.10.31	Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
1CO.10.32	Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:
1CO.10.33	Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.
1CO.11.1	Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.
1CO.11.2	Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.
1CO.11.3	But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
1CO.11.4	Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.
1CO.11.5	But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
1CO.11.6	For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
1CO.11.7	For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
1CO.11.8	For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
1CO.11.9	Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
1CO.11.10	For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.
1CO.11.11	Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
1CO.11.12	For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
1CO.11.13	Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
1CO.11.14	Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
1CO.11.15	But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.
1CO.11.16	But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
1CO.11.17	Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
1CO.11.18	For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
1CO.11.19	For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
1CO.11.20	When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.
1CO.11.21	For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
1CO.11.22	What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
1CO.11.23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:
1CO.11.24	And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, 
1CO.11.25	After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, 
1CO.11.26	For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.
1CO.11.27	Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
1CO.11.28	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.
1CO.11.29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
1CO.11.30	For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
1CO.11.31	For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
1CO.11.32	But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
1CO.11.33	Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.
1CO.11.34	And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
1CO.12.1	Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
1CO.12.2	Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.
1CO.12.3	Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
1CO.12.4	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
1CO.12.5	And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
1CO.12.6	And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.
1CO.12.7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
1CO.12.8	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
1CO.12.9	To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
1CO.12.10	To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
1CO.12.11	But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
1CO.12.12	For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.
1CO.12.13	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
1CO.12.14	For the body is not one member, but many.
1CO.12.15	If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
1CO.12.16	And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
1CO.12.17	If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
1CO.12.18	But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
1CO.12.19	And if they were all one member, where were the body?
1CO.12.20	But now are they many members, yet but one body.
1CO.12.21	And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
1CO.12.22	Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
1CO.12.23	And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.
1CO.12.24	For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:
1CO.12.25	That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
1CO.12.26	And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
1CO.12.27	Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
1CO.12.28	And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
1CO.12.29	Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?
1CO.12.30	Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
1CO.12.31	But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
1CO.13.1	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
1CO.13.2	And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
1CO.13.3	And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
1CO.13.4	Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
1CO.13.5	Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
1CO.13.6	Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
1CO.13.7	Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
1CO.13.8	Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
1CO.13.9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
1CO.13.10	But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
1CO.13.12	For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
1CO.13.13	And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.
1CO.14.1	Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.
1CO.14.2	For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.
1CO.14.3	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.
1CO.14.4	He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
1CO.14.5	I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
1CO.14.6	Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?
1CO.14.7	And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
1CO.14.8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?
1CO.14.9	So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.
1CO.14.10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.
1CO.14.11	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.
1CO.14.12	Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.
1CO.14.13	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.
1CO.14.14	For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
1CO.14.15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
1CO.14.16	Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?
1CO.14.17	For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
1CO.14.18	I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:
1CO.14.19	Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.
1CO.14.20	Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.
1CO.14.21	In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.
1CO.14.22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.
1CO.14.23	If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?
1CO.14.24	But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:
1CO.14.25	And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.
1CO.14.26	How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.
1CO.14.27	If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.
1CO.14.28	But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
1CO.14.29	Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.
1CO.14.30	If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.
1CO.14.31	For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.
1CO.14.32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
1CO.14.33	For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.
1CO.14.34	Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.
1CO.14.35	And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.
1CO.14.36	What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?
1CO.14.37	If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.
1CO.14.38	But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
1CO.14.39	Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
1CO.14.40	Let all things be done decently and in order.
1CO.15.1	Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
1CO.15.2	By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
1CO.15.3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
1CO.15.4	And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
1CO.15.5	And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
1CO.15.6	After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.
1CO.15.7	After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
1CO.15.8	And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
1CO.15.9	For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
1CO.15.10	But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
1CO.15.11	Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
1CO.15.12	Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
1CO.15.13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:
1CO.15.14	And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.
1CO.15.15	Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.
1CO.15.16	For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:
1CO.15.17	And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.
1CO.15.18	Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
1CO.15.19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
1CO.15.20	But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.
1CO.15.21	For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.
1CO.15.22	For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
1CO.15.23	But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.
1CO.15.24	Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.
1CO.15.25	For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
1CO.15.26	The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
1CO.15.27	For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him.
1CO.15.28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
1CO.15.29	Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?
1CO.15.30	And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
1CO.15.31	I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
1CO.15.32	If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.
1CO.15.33	Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
1CO.15.34	Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.
1CO.15.35	But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
1CO.15.36	Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:
1CO.15.37	And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:
1CO.15.38	But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.
1CO.15.39	All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.
1CO.15.40	There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.
1CO.15.41	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.
1CO.15.42	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
1CO.15.43	It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
1CO.15.44	It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
1CO.15.45	And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.
1CO.15.46	Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
1CO.15.47	The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.
1CO.15.48	As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
1CO.15.49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
1CO.15.50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
1CO.15.51	Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
1CO.15.52	In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
1CO.15.53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
1CO.15.54	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
1CO.15.55	O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
1CO.15.56	The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
1CO.15.57	But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.15.58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
1CO.16.1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.
1CO.16.2	Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.
1CO.16.3	And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.
1CO.16.4	And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.
1CO.16.5	Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.
1CO.16.6	And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.
1CO.16.7	For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
1CO.16.8	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
1CO.16.9	For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.
1CO.16.10	Now if Timothy come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.
1CO.16.11	Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.
1CO.16.12	As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.
1CO.16.13	Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
1CO.16.14	Let all your things be done with charity.
1CO.16.15	I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)
1CO.16.16	That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.
1CO.16.17	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
1CO.16.18	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.
1CO.16.19	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
1CO.16.20	All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.
1CO.16.21	The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
1CO.16.22	If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.
1CO.16.23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
1CO.16.24	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2CO.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:
2CO.1.2	Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
2CO.1.3	Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;
2CO.1.4	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
2CO.1.5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.
2CO.1.6	And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.
2CO.1.7	And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.
2CO.1.8	For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:
2CO.1.9	But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:
2CO.1.10	Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;
2CO.1.11	Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.
2CO.1.12	For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.
2CO.1.13	For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;
2CO.1.14	As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
2CO.1.15	And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;
2CO.1.16	And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.
2CO.1.17	When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?
2CO.1.18	But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.
2CO.1.19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.
2CO.1.20	For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.
2CO.1.21	Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;
2CO.1.22	Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
2CO.1.23	Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.
2CO.1.24	Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.
2CO.2.1	But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.
2CO.2.2	For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?
2CO.2.3	And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
2CO.2.4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.
2CO.2.5	But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.
2CO.2.6	Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.
2CO.2.7	So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.
2CO.2.8	Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.
2CO.2.9	For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.
2CO.2.10	To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;
2CO.2.11	Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
2CO.2.12	Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,
2CO.2.13	I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.
2CO.2.14	Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.
2CO.2.15	For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:
2CO.2.16	To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
2CO.2.17	For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
2CO.3.1	Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?
2CO.3.2	Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:
2CO.3.3	Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
2CO.3.4	And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
2CO.3.5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;
2CO.3.6	Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
2CO.3.7	But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:
2CO.3.8	How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
2CO.3.9	For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
2CO.3.10	For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
2CO.3.11	For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.
2CO.3.12	Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
2CO.3.13	And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:
2CO.3.14	But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is done away in Christ.
2CO.3.15	But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.
2CO.3.16	Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.
2CO.3.17	Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
2CO.3.18	But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
2CO.4.1	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;
2CO.4.2	But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
2CO.4.3	But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
2CO.4.4	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
2CO.4.5	For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.
2CO.4.6	For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
2CO.4.7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.
2CO.4.8	We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;
2CO.4.9	Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
2CO.4.10	Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
2CO.4.11	For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
2CO.4.12	So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
2CO.4.13	We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;
2CO.4.14	Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.
2CO.4.15	For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.
2CO.4.16	For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
2CO.4.17	For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;
2CO.4.18	While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.
2CO.5.1	For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
2CO.5.2	For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:
2CO.5.3	If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
2CO.5.4	For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
2CO.5.5	Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
2CO.5.6	Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
2CO.5.7	(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
2CO.5.8	We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
2CO.5.9	Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
2CO.5.10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
2CO.5.11	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.
2CO.5.12	For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.
2CO.5.13	For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.
2CO.5.14	For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:
2CO.5.15	And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.
2CO.5.16	Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.
2CO.5.17	Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.
2CO.5.18	And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
2CO.5.19	To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
2CO.5.20	Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.
2CO.5.21	For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
2CO.6.1	We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
2CO.6.2	(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)
2CO.6.3	Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
2CO.6.4	But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
2CO.6.5	In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;
2CO.6.6	By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
2CO.6.7	By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
2CO.6.8	By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;
2CO.6.9	As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
2CO.6.10	As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
2CO.6.11	O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.
2CO.6.12	Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
2CO.6.13	Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.
2CO.6.14	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?
2CO.6.15	And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
2CO.6.16	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
2CO.6.17	Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,
2CO.6.18	And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
2CO.7.1	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
2CO.7.2	Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.
2CO.7.3	I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.
2CO.7.4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.
2CO.7.5	For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.
2CO.7.6	Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
2CO.7.7	And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.
2CO.7.8	For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.
2CO.7.9	Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.
2CO.7.10	For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
2CO.7.11	For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.
2CO.7.12	Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.
2CO.7.13	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.
2CO.7.14	For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.
2CO.7.15	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
2CO.7.16	I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.
2CO.8.1	Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
2CO.8.2	How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
2CO.8.3	For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;
2CO.8.4	Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
2CO.8.5	And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.
2CO.8.6	Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.
2CO.8.7	Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.
2CO.8.8	I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
2CO.8.9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
2CO.8.10	And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.
2CO.8.11	Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.
2CO.8.12	For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.
2CO.8.13	For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:
2CO.8.14	But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:
2CO.8.15	As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.
2CO.8.16	But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.
2CO.8.17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.
2CO.8.18	And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;
2CO.8.19	And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:
2CO.8.20	Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:
2CO.8.21	Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
2CO.8.22	And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.
2CO.8.23	Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.
2CO.8.24	Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
2CO.9.1	For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
2CO.9.2	For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.
2CO.9.3	Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:
2CO.9.4	Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.
2CO.9.5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.
2CO.9.6	But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
2CO.9.7	Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.
2CO.9.8	And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:
2CO.9.9	(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.
2CO.9.10	Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)
2CO.9.11	Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.
2CO.9.12	For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;
2CO.9.13	Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;
2CO.9.14	And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.
2CO.9.15	Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
2CO.10.1	Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:
2CO.10.2	But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
2CO.10.3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
2CO.10.4	(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)
2CO.10.5	Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
2CO.10.6	And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
2CO.10.7	Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.
2CO.10.8	For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:
2CO.10.9	That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
2CO.10.10	For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.
2CO.10.11	Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.
2CO.10.12	For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
2CO.10.13	But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.
2CO.10.14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:
2CO.10.15	Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,
2CO.10.16	To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.
2CO.10.17	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
2CO.10.18	For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
2CO.11.1	Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.
2CO.11.2	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
2CO.11.3	But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
2CO.11.4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.
2CO.11.5	For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
2CO.11.6	But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things.
2CO.11.7	Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?
2CO.11.8	I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.
2CO.11.9	And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.
2CO.11.10	As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
2CO.11.11	Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
2CO.11.12	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
2CO.11.13	For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
2CO.11.14	And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
2CO.11.15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
2CO.11.16	I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.
2CO.11.17	That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
2CO.11.18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
2CO.11.19	For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.
2CO.11.20	For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.
2CO.11.21	I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.
2CO.11.22	Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.
2CO.11.23	Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.
2CO.11.24	Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.
2CO.11.25	Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
2CO.11.26	In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;
2CO.11.27	In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
2CO.11.28	Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
2CO.11.29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
2CO.11.30	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.
2CO.11.31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.
2CO.11.32	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:
2CO.11.33	And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
2CO.12.1	It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
2CO.12.2	I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
2CO.12.3	And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
2CO.12.4	How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
2CO.12.5	Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.
2CO.12.6	For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.
2CO.12.7	And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
2CO.12.8	For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
2CO.12.9	And he said unto me, 
2CO.12.10	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
2CO.12.11	I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.
2CO.12.12	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
2CO.12.13	For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.
2CO.12.14	Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
2CO.12.15	And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.
2CO.12.16	But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
2CO.12.17	Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
2CO.12.18	I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?
2CO.12.19	Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
2CO.12.20	For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
2CO.12.21	And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
2CO.13.1	This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
2CO.13.2	I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:
2CO.13.3	Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.
2CO.13.4	For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.
2CO.13.5	Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?
2CO.13.6	But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
2CO.13.7	Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.
2CO.13.8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
2CO.13.9	For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.
2CO.13.10	Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.
2CO.13.11	Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
2CO.13.12	Greet one another with an holy kiss.
2CO.13.13	All the saints salute you.
2CO.13.14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.
GAL.1.1	Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)
GAL.1.2	And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:
GAL.1.3	Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
GAL.1.4	Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:
GAL.1.5	To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
GAL.1.6	I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:
GAL.1.7	Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
GAL.1.8	But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
GAL.1.9	As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.
GAL.1.10	For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
GAL.1.11	But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.
GAL.1.12	For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
GAL.1.13	For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:
GAL.1.14	And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
GAL.1.15	But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,
GAL.1.16	To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
GAL.1.17	Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
GAL.1.18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.
GAL.1.19	But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.
GAL.1.20	Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.
GAL.1.21	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
GAL.1.22	And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:
GAL.1.23	But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.
GAL.1.24	And they glorified God in me.
GAL.2.1	Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.
GAL.2.2	And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.
GAL.2.3	But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:
GAL.2.4	And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
GAL.2.5	To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
GAL.2.6	But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:
GAL.2.7	But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;
GAL.2.8	(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)
GAL.2.9	And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.
GAL.2.10	Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.
GAL.2.11	But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.
GAL.2.12	For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.
GAL.2.13	And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
GAL.2.14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
GAL.2.15	We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
GAL.2.16	Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
GAL.2.17	But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.
GAL.2.18	For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.
GAL.2.19	For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.
GAL.2.20	I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
GAL.2.21	I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.
GAL.3.1	O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?
GAL.3.2	This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
GAL.3.3	Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?
GAL.3.4	Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.
GAL.3.5	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
GAL.3.6	Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
GAL.3.7	Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.
GAL.3.8	And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.
GAL.3.9	So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
GAL.3.10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.
GAL.3.11	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.
GAL.3.12	And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.
GAL.3.13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:
GAL.3.14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
GAL.3.15	Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.
GAL.3.16	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
GAL.3.17	And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.
GAL.3.18	For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.
GAL.3.19	Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
GAL.3.20	Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.
GAL.3.21	Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.
GAL.3.22	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
GAL.3.23	But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
GAL.3.24	Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
GAL.3.25	But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.
GAL.3.26	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
GAL.3.27	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
GAL.3.28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
GAL.3.29	And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.
GAL.4.1	Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
GAL.4.2	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.
GAL.4.3	Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:
GAL.4.4	But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
GAL.4.5	To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
GAL.4.6	And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
GAL.4.7	Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
GAL.4.8	Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.
GAL.4.9	But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?
GAL.4.10	Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.
GAL.4.11	I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.
GAL.4.12	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.
GAL.4.13	Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.
GAL.4.14	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
GAL.4.15	Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.
GAL.4.16	Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
GAL.4.17	They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.
GAL.4.18	But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.
GAL.4.19	My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,
GAL.4.20	I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.
GAL.4.21	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
GAL.4.22	For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.
GAL.4.23	But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.
GAL.4.24	Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
GAL.4.25	For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
GAL.4.26	But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
GAL.4.27	For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.
GAL.4.28	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
GAL.4.29	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.
GAL.4.30	Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
GAL.4.31	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
GAL.5.1	Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
GAL.5.2	Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
GAL.5.3	For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
GAL.5.4	Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
GAL.5.5	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
GAL.5.6	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
GAL.5.7	Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
GAL.5.8	This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.
GAL.5.9	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
GAL.5.10	I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
GAL.5.11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.
GAL.5.12	I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
GAL.5.13	For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
GAL.5.14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
GAL.5.15	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
GAL.5.16	This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
GAL.5.17	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
GAL.5.18	But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
GAL.5.19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
GAL.5.20	Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
GAL.5.21	Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
GAL.5.22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
GAL.5.23	Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
GAL.5.24	And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
GAL.5.25	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
GAL.5.26	Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
GAL.6.1	Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
GAL.6.2	Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
GAL.6.3	For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
GAL.6.4	But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
GAL.6.5	For every man shall bear his own burden.
GAL.6.6	Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
GAL.6.7	Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
GAL.6.8	For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
GAL.6.9	And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
GAL.6.10	As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
GAL.6.11	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.
GAL.6.12	As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
GAL.6.13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
GAL.6.14	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
GAL.6.15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
GAL.6.16	And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
GAL.6.17	From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
GAL.6.18	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
EPH.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
EPH.1.2	Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.1.3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:
EPH.1.4	According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:
EPH.1.5	Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
EPH.1.6	To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.
EPH.1.7	In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
EPH.1.8	Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
EPH.1.9	Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:
EPH.1.10	That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:
EPH.1.11	In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:
EPH.1.12	That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.
EPH.1.13	In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
EPH.1.14	Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
EPH.1.15	Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,
EPH.1.16	Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
EPH.1.17	That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:
EPH.1.18	The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
EPH.1.19	And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,
EPH.1.20	Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,
EPH.1.21	Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:
EPH.1.22	And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,
EPH.1.23	Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
EPH.2.1	And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
EPH.2.2	Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
EPH.2.3	Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
EPH.2.4	But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
EPH.2.5	Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
EPH.2.6	And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:
EPH.2.7	That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
EPH.2.8	For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
EPH.2.9	Not of works, lest any man should boast.
EPH.2.10	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
EPH.2.11	Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;
EPH.2.12	That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:
EPH.2.13	But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
EPH.2.14	For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;
EPH.2.15	Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;
EPH.2.16	And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:
EPH.2.17	And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.
EPH.2.18	For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
EPH.2.19	Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;
EPH.2.20	And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;
EPH.2.21	In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:
EPH.2.22	In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
EPH.3.1	For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
EPH.3.2	If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:
EPH.3.3	How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,
EPH.3.4	Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
EPH.3.5	Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
EPH.3.6	That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:
EPH.3.7	Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
EPH.3.8	Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
EPH.3.9	And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
EPH.3.10	To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
EPH.3.11	According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
EPH.3.12	In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
EPH.3.13	Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
EPH.3.14	For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
EPH.3.15	Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
EPH.3.16	That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;
EPH.3.17	That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
EPH.3.18	May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
EPH.3.19	And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.
EPH.3.20	Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
EPH.3.21	Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.
EPH.4.1	I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,
EPH.4.2	With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;
EPH.4.3	Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
EPH.4.4	There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;
EPH.4.5	One Lord, one faith, one baptism,
EPH.4.6	One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.
EPH.4.7	But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
EPH.4.8	Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.
EPH.4.9	(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
EPH.4.10	He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)
EPH.4.11	And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
EPH.4.12	For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
EPH.4.13	Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
EPH.4.14	That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;
EPH.4.15	But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:
EPH.4.16	From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.
EPH.4.17	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,
EPH.4.18	Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:
EPH.4.19	Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
EPH.4.20	But ye have not so learned Christ;
EPH.4.21	If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:
EPH.4.22	That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;
EPH.4.23	And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
EPH.4.24	And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
EPH.4.25	Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.
EPH.4.26	Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:
EPH.4.27	Neither give place to the devil.
EPH.4.28	Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.
EPH.4.29	Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.
EPH.4.30	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.
EPH.4.31	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:
EPH.4.32	And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.
EPH.5.1	Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;
EPH.5.2	And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.
EPH.5.3	But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
EPH.5.4	Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
EPH.5.5	For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
EPH.5.6	Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
EPH.5.7	Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
EPH.5.8	For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:
EPH.5.9	(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
EPH.5.10	Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
EPH.5.11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
EPH.5.12	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
EPH.5.13	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
EPH.5.14	Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
EPH.5.15	See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
EPH.5.16	Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
EPH.5.17	Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.
EPH.5.18	And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
EPH.5.19	Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
EPH.5.20	Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
EPH.5.21	Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
EPH.5.22	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
EPH.5.23	For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.
EPH.5.24	Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.
EPH.5.25	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
EPH.5.26	That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
EPH.5.27	That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
EPH.5.28	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
EPH.5.29	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
EPH.5.30	For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
EPH.5.31	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
EPH.5.32	This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
EPH.5.33	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.
EPH.6.1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
EPH.6.2	Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)
EPH.6.3	That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
EPH.6.4	And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
EPH.6.5	Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;
EPH.6.6	Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
EPH.6.7	With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:
EPH.6.8	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.
EPH.6.9	And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.
EPH.6.10	Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
EPH.6.11	Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
EPH.6.12	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
EPH.6.13	Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
EPH.6.14	Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
EPH.6.15	And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
EPH.6.16	Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
EPH.6.17	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
EPH.6.18	Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
EPH.6.19	And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,
EPH.6.20	For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
EPH.6.21	But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:
EPH.6.22	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.
EPH.6.23	Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.6.24	Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
PHP.1.1	Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
PHP.1.2	Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.3	I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
PHP.1.4	Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,
PHP.1.5	For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
PHP.1.6	Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:
PHP.1.7	Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.
PHP.1.8	For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.9	And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;
PHP.1.10	That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;
PHP.1.11	Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
PHP.1.12	But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;
PHP.1.13	So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;
PHP.1.14	And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
PHP.1.15	Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
PHP.1.16	The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:
PHP.1.17	But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
PHP.1.18	What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
PHP.1.19	For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
PHP.1.20	According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.
PHP.1.21	For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
PHP.1.22	But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
PHP.1.23	For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:
PHP.1.24	Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.
PHP.1.25	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;
PHP.1.26	That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.
PHP.1.27	Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
PHP.1.28	And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.
PHP.1.29	For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;
PHP.1.30	Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
PHP.2.1	If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
PHP.2.2	Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.
PHP.2.3	Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
PHP.2.4	Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
PHP.2.5	Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
PHP.2.6	Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
PHP.2.7	But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
PHP.2.8	And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
PHP.2.9	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
PHP.2.10	That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
PHP.2.11	And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
PHP.2.12	Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
PHP.2.13	For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
PHP.2.14	Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
PHP.2.15	That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;
PHP.2.16	Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.
PHP.2.17	Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
PHP.2.18	For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
PHP.2.19	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
PHP.2.20	For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
PHP.2.21	For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.
PHP.2.22	But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
PHP.2.23	Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
PHP.2.24	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
PHP.2.25	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.
PHP.2.26	For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.
PHP.2.27	For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
PHP.2.28	I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
PHP.2.29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
PHP.2.30	Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
PHP.3.1	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.
PHP.3.2	Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
PHP.3.3	For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
PHP.3.4	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
PHP.3.5	Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
PHP.3.6	Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.
PHP.3.7	But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
PHP.3.8	Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,
PHP.3.9	And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
PHP.3.10	That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;
PHP.3.11	If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
PHP.3.12	Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
PHP.3.13	Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
PHP.3.14	I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
PHP.3.15	Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
PHP.3.16	Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
PHP.3.17	Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an example.
PHP.3.18	(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:
PHP.3.19	Whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)
PHP.3.20	For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
PHP.3.21	Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
PHP.4.1	Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.
PHP.4.2	I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
PHP.4.3	And I entreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.
PHP.4.4	Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.
PHP.4.5	Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
PHP.4.6	Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
PHP.4.7	And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
PHP.4.8	Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
PHP.4.9	Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
PHP.4.10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
PHP.4.11	Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.
PHP.4.12	I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
PHP.4.13	I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
PHP.4.14	Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.
PHP.4.15	Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
PHP.4.16	For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
PHP.4.17	Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
PHP.4.18	But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
PHP.4.19	But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
PHP.4.20	Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
PHP.4.21	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.
PHP.4.22	All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.
PHP.4.23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
COL.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
COL.1.2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
COL.1.3	We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
COL.1.4	Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,
COL.1.5	For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;
COL.1.6	Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:
COL.1.7	As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;
COL.1.8	Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
COL.1.9	For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
COL.1.10	That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
COL.1.11	Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;
COL.1.12	Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
COL.1.13	Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
COL.1.14	In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:
COL.1.15	Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
COL.1.16	For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
COL.1.17	And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
COL.1.18	And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
COL.1.19	For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;
COL.1.20	And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.
COL.1.21	And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
COL.1.22	In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:
COL.1.23	If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;
COL.1.24	Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:
COL.1.25	Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;
COL.1.26	Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:
COL.1.27	To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
COL.1.28	Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:
COL.1.29	Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.
COL.2.1	For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
COL.2.2	That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;
COL.2.3	In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
COL.2.4	And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
COL.2.5	For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.
COL.2.6	As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:
COL.2.7	Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
COL.2.8	Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.
COL.2.9	For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
COL.2.10	And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:
COL.2.11	In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:
COL.2.12	Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.
COL.2.13	And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;
COL.2.14	Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
COL.2.15	And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
COL.2.16	Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:
COL.2.17	Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.
COL.2.18	Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
COL.2.19	And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.
COL.2.20	Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,
COL.2.21	(Touch not; taste not; handle not;
COL.2.22	Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?
COL.2.23	Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.
COL.3.1	If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
COL.3.2	Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
COL.3.3	For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
COL.3.4	When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
COL.3.5	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:
COL.3.6	For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:
COL.3.7	In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.
COL.3.8	But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
COL.3.9	Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;
COL.3.10	And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:
COL.3.11	Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.
COL.3.12	Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
COL.3.13	Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.
COL.3.14	And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.
COL.3.15	And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.
COL.3.16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
COL.3.17	And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
COL.3.18	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.
COL.3.19	Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.
COL.3.20	Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.
COL.3.21	Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.
COL.3.22	Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:
COL.3.23	And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
COL.3.24	Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
COL.3.25	But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
COL.4.1	Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.
COL.4.2	Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;
COL.4.3	Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:
COL.4.4	That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
COL.4.5	Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.
COL.4.6	Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.
COL.4.7	All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:
COL.4.8	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;
COL.4.9	With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.
COL.4.10	Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Mark, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)
COL.4.11	And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.
COL.4.12	Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.
COL.4.13	For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.
COL.4.14	Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.
COL.4.15	Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.
COL.4.16	And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.
COL.4.17	And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.
COL.4.18	The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
1TH.1.1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1TH.1.2	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
1TH.1.3	Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;
1TH.1.4	Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.
1TH.1.5	For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
1TH.1.6	And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:
1TH.1.7	So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
1TH.1.8	For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.
1TH.1.9	For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;
1TH.1.10	And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.
1TH.2.1	For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:
1TH.2.2	But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.
1TH.2.3	For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:
1TH.2.4	But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.
1TH.2.5	For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:
1TH.2.6	Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.
1TH.2.7	But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:
1TH.2.8	So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.
1TH.2.9	For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
1TH.2.10	Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:
1TH.2.11	As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,
1TH.2.12	That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.
1TH.2.13	For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.
1TH.2.14	For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:
1TH.2.15	Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:
1TH.2.16	Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
1TH.2.17	But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.
1TH.2.18	Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.
1TH.2.19	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
1TH.2.20	For ye are our glory and joy.
1TH.3.1	Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;
1TH.3.2	And sent Timothy, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:
1TH.3.3	That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
1TH.3.4	For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
1TH.3.5	For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.
1TH.3.6	But now when Timothy came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:
1TH.3.7	Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:
1TH.3.8	For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
1TH.3.9	For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;
1TH.3.10	Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
1TH.3.11	Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.
1TH.3.12	And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:
1TH.3.13	To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
1TH.4.1	Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.
1TH.4.2	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
1TH.4.3	For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:
1TH.4.4	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;
1TH.4.5	Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:
1TH.4.6	That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.
1TH.4.7	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
1TH.4.8	He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.
1TH.4.9	But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
1TH.4.10	And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;
1TH.4.11	And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
1TH.4.12	That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.
1TH.4.13	But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
1TH.4.14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
1TH.4.15	For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
1TH.4.16	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
1TH.4.17	Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
1TH.4.18	Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
1TH.5.1	But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
1TH.5.2	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
1TH.5.3	For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
1TH.5.4	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
1TH.5.5	Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
1TH.5.6	Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.
1TH.5.7	For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
1TH.5.8	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.
1TH.5.9	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
1TH.5.10	Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
1TH.5.11	Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.
1TH.5.12	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
1TH.5.13	And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.
1TH.5.14	Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.
1TH.5.15	See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.
1TH.5.16	Rejoice evermore.
1TH.5.17	Pray without ceasing.
1TH.5.18	In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
1TH.5.19	Quench not the Spirit.
1TH.5.20	Despise not prophesyings.
1TH.5.21	Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
1TH.5.22	Abstain from all appearance of evil.
1TH.5.23	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1TH.5.24	Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.
1TH.5.25	Brethren, pray for us.
1TH.5.26	Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
1TH.5.27	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.
1TH.5.28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
2TH.1.1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2TH.1.2	Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.1.3	We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;
2TH.1.4	So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:
2TH.1.5	Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
2TH.1.6	Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
2TH.1.7	And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
2TH.1.8	In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
2TH.1.9	Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;
2TH.1.10	When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.
2TH.1.11	Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:
2TH.1.12	That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.1	Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,
2TH.2.2	That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.
2TH.2.3	Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
2TH.2.4	Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.
2TH.2.5	Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
2TH.2.6	And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.
2TH.2.7	For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.
2TH.2.8	And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:
2TH.2.9	Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
2TH.2.10	And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
2TH.2.11	And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:
2TH.2.12	That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
2TH.2.13	But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:
2TH.2.14	Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.15	Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.
2TH.2.16	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,
2TH.2.17	Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.
2TH.3.1	Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:
2TH.3.2	And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.
2TH.3.3	But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.
2TH.3.4	And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.
2TH.3.5	And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.
2TH.3.6	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.
2TH.3.7	For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
2TH.3.8	Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:
2TH.3.9	Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.
2TH.3.10	For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.
2TH.3.11	For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.
2TH.3.12	Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
2TH.3.13	But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
2TH.3.14	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
2TH.3.15	Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
2TH.3.16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.
2TH.3.17	The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.
2TH.3.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
1TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;
1TI.1.2	Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
1TI.1.3	As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
1TI.1.4	Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.
1TI.1.5	Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:
1TI.1.6	From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
1TI.1.7	Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
1TI.1.8	But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;
1TI.1.9	Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
1TI.1.10	For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
1TI.1.11	According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
1TI.1.12	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
1TI.1.13	Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
1TI.1.14	And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
1TI.1.15	This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
1TI.1.16	Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
1TI.1.17	Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
1TI.1.18	This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;
1TI.1.19	Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:
1TI.1.20	Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
1TI.2.1	I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;
1TI.2.2	For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.
1TI.2.3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
1TI.2.4	Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
1TI.2.5	For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
1TI.2.6	Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
1TI.2.7	Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.
1TI.2.8	I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.
1TI.2.9	In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;
1TI.2.10	But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.
1TI.2.11	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
1TI.2.12	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.
1TI.2.13	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
1TI.2.14	And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.
1TI.2.15	Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
1TI.3.1	This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
1TI.3.2	A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
1TI.3.3	Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;
1TI.3.4	One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
1TI.3.5	(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
1TI.3.6	Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
1TI.3.7	Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
1TI.3.8	Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;
1TI.3.9	Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
1TI.3.10	And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.
1TI.3.11	Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.
1TI.3.12	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
1TI.3.13	For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
1TI.3.14	These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:
1TI.3.15	But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
1TI.3.16	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
1TI.4.1	Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;
1TI.4.2	Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
1TI.4.3	Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.
1TI.4.4	For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:
1TI.4.5	For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
1TI.4.6	If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.
1TI.4.7	But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.
1TI.4.8	For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
1TI.4.9	This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
1TI.4.10	For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.
1TI.4.11	These things command and teach.
1TI.4.12	Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
1TI.4.13	Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
1TI.4.14	Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
1TI.4.15	Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
1TI.4.16	Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
1TI.5.1	Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;
1TI.5.2	The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.
1TI.5.3	Honour widows that are widows indeed.
1TI.5.4	But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.
1TI.5.5	Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
1TI.5.6	But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
1TI.5.7	And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.
1TI.5.8	But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
1TI.5.9	Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,
1TI.5.10	Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.
1TI.5.11	But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;
1TI.5.12	Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.
1TI.5.13	And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
1TI.5.14	I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.
1TI.5.15	For some are already turned aside after Satan.
1TI.5.16	If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
1TI.5.17	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.
1TI.5.18	For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, 
1TI.5.19	Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.
1TI.5.20	Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.
1TI.5.21	I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.
1TI.5.22	Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.
1TI.5.23	Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.
1TI.5.24	Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.
1TI.5.25	Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
1TI.6.1	Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.
1TI.6.2	And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.
1TI.6.3	If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;
1TI.6.4	He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
1TI.6.5	Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.
1TI.6.6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.
1TI.6.7	For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
1TI.6.8	And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
1TI.6.9	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.
1TI.6.10	For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
1TI.6.11	But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.
1TI.6.13	I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;
1TI.6.14	That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
1TI.6.15	Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
1TI.6.16	Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.
1TI.6.17	Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
1TI.6.18	That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
1TI.6.19	Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
1TI.6.20	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:
1TI.6.21	Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.
2TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,
2TI.1.2	To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
2TI.1.3	I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;
2TI.1.4	Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
2TI.1.5	When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.
2TI.1.6	Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.
2TI.1.7	For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
2TI.1.8	Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;
2TI.1.9	Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
2TI.1.10	But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:
2TI.1.11	Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
2TI.1.12	For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
2TI.1.13	Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
2TI.1.14	That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.
2TI.1.15	This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
2TI.1.16	The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:
2TI.1.17	But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.
2TI.1.18	The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
2TI.2.1	Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
2TI.2.2	And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
2TI.2.3	Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
2TI.2.4	No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
2TI.2.5	And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.
2TI.2.6	The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.
2TI.2.7	Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
2TI.2.8	Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:
2TI.2.9	Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.
2TI.2.10	Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
2TI.2.11	It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:
2TI.2.12	If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:
2TI.2.13	If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.
2TI.2.14	Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.
2TI.2.15	Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
2TI.2.16	But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.
2TI.2.17	And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
2TI.2.18	Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.
2TI.2.19	Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
2TI.2.20	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
2TI.2.21	If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.
2TI.2.22	Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
2TI.2.23	But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.
2TI.2.24	And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,
2TI.2.25	In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;
2TI.2.26	And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
2TI.3.1	This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
2TI.3.2	For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
2TI.3.3	Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
2TI.3.4	Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
2TI.3.5	Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
2TI.3.6	For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
2TI.3.7	Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
2TI.3.8	Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
2TI.3.9	But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.
2TI.3.10	But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,
2TI.3.11	Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.
2TI.3.12	Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
2TI.3.13	But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
2TI.3.14	But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;
2TI.3.15	And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
2TI.3.16	All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
2TI.3.17	That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.
2TI.4.1	I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
2TI.4.2	Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
2TI.4.3	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;
2TI.4.4	And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
2TI.4.5	But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
2TI.4.6	For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
2TI.4.7	I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:
2TI.4.8	Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.
2TI.4.9	Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:
2TI.4.10	For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.
2TI.4.11	Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.
2TI.4.12	And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
2TI.4.13	The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.
2TI.4.14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:
2TI.4.15	Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
2TI.4.16	At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.
2TI.4.17	Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
2TI.4.18	And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
2TI.4.19	Salute Priscilla and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
2TI.4.20	Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletus sick.
2TI.4.21	Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
2TI.4.22	The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
TIT.1.1	Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
TIT.1.2	In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
TIT.1.3	But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
TIT.1.4	To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
TIT.1.5	For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
TIT.1.6	If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
TIT.1.7	For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
TIT.1.8	But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
TIT.1.9	Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
TIT.1.10	For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
TIT.1.11	Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.
TIT.1.12	One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretans are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.
TIT.1.13	This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
TIT.1.14	Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
TIT.1.15	Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
TIT.1.16	They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
TIT.2.1	But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
TIT.2.2	That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.
TIT.2.3	The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
TIT.2.4	That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,
TIT.2.5	To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
TIT.2.6	Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
TIT.2.7	In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
TIT.2.8	Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
TIT.2.9	Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;
TIT.2.10	Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
TIT.2.11	For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
TIT.2.12	Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;
TIT.2.13	Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
TIT.2.14	Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
TIT.2.15	These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
TIT.3.1	Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,
TIT.3.2	To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.
TIT.3.3	For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
TIT.3.4	But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,
TIT.3.5	Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
TIT.3.6	Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
TIT.3.7	That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
TIT.3.8	This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.
TIT.3.9	But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
TIT.3.10	A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;
TIT.3.11	Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.
TIT.3.12	When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.
TIT.3.13	Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
TIT.3.14	And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
TIT.3.15	All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
PHM.1.1	Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
PHM.1.2	And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:
PHM.1.3	Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHM.1.4	I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
PHM.1.5	Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
PHM.1.6	That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
PHM.1.7	For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
PHM.1.8	Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,
PHM.1.9	Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
PHM.1.10	I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
PHM.1.11	Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:
PHM.1.12	Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
PHM.1.13	Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
PHM.1.14	But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
PHM.1.15	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
PHM.1.16	Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
PHM.1.17	If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
PHM.1.18	If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;
PHM.1.19	I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
PHM.1.20	Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
PHM.1.21	Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
PHM.1.22	But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
PHM.1.23	There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
PHM.1.24	Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellowlabourers.
PHM.1.25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
HEB.1.1	God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
HEB.1.2	Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
HEB.1.3	Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
HEB.1.4	Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.
HEB.1.5	For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
HEB.1.6	And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.
HEB.1.7	And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.
HEB.1.8	But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
HEB.1.9	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
HEB.1.10	And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:
HEB.1.11	They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
HEB.1.12	And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
HEB.1.13	But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?
HEB.1.14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?
HEB.2.1	Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.
HEB.2.2	For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;
HEB.2.3	How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;
HEB.2.4	God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?
HEB.2.5	For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.
HEB.2.6	But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
HEB.2.7	Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:
HEB.2.8	Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
HEB.2.9	But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
HEB.2.10	For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
HEB.2.11	For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
HEB.2.12	Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.
HEB.2.13	And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.
HEB.2.14	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
HEB.2.15	And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
HEB.2.16	For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.
HEB.2.17	Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
HEB.2.18	For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
HEB.3.1	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;
HEB.3.2	Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.
HEB.3.3	For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.
HEB.3.4	For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.
HEB.3.5	And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;
HEB.3.6	But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
HEB.3.7	Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,
HEB.3.8	Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
HEB.3.9	When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
HEB.3.10	Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.
HEB.3.11	So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)
HEB.3.12	Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
HEB.3.13	But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
HEB.3.14	For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;
HEB.3.15	While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
HEB.3.16	For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
HEB.3.17	But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?
HEB.3.18	And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?
HEB.3.19	So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
HEB.4.1	Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
HEB.4.2	For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.
HEB.4.3	For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
HEB.4.4	For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
HEB.4.5	And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.
HEB.4.6	Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:
HEB.4.7	Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
HEB.4.8	For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.
HEB.4.9	There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
HEB.4.10	For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.
HEB.4.11	Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
HEB.4.12	For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
HEB.4.13	Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
HEB.4.14	Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.
HEB.4.15	For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
HEB.4.16	Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
HEB.5.1	For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:
HEB.5.2	Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
HEB.5.3	And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
HEB.5.4	And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.
HEB.5.5	So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.
HEB.5.6	As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
HEB.5.7	Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;
HEB.5.8	Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;
HEB.5.9	And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;
HEB.5.10	Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.
HEB.5.11	Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.
HEB.5.12	For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.
HEB.5.13	For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
HEB.5.14	But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
HEB.6.1	Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
HEB.6.2	Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
HEB.6.3	And this will we do, if God permit.
HEB.6.4	For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
HEB.6.5	And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
HEB.6.6	If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.
HEB.6.7	For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:
HEB.6.8	But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.
HEB.6.9	But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
HEB.6.10	For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
HEB.6.11	And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:
HEB.6.12	That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
HEB.6.13	For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,
HEB.6.14	Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
HEB.6.15	And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
HEB.6.16	For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.
HEB.6.17	Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:
HEB.6.18	That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:
HEB.6.19	Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
HEB.6.20	Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
HEB.7.1	For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
HEB.7.2	To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
HEB.7.3	Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.
HEB.7.4	Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
HEB.7.5	And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
HEB.7.6	But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
HEB.7.7	And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
HEB.7.8	And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
HEB.7.9	And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.
HEB.7.10	For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
HEB.7.11	If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
HEB.7.12	For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
HEB.7.13	For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.
HEB.7.14	For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
HEB.7.15	And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,
HEB.7.16	Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.
HEB.7.17	For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
HEB.7.18	For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
HEB.7.19	For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.
HEB.7.20	And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:
HEB.7.21	(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)
HEB.7.22	By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
HEB.7.23	And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:
HEB.7.24	But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
HEB.7.25	Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
HEB.7.26	For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
HEB.7.27	Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
HEB.7.28	For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
HEB.8.1	Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
HEB.8.2	A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
HEB.8.3	For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
HEB.8.4	For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
HEB.8.5	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
HEB.8.6	But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
HEB.8.7	For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
HEB.8.8	For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
HEB.8.9	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
HEB.8.10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
HEB.8.11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
HEB.8.12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
HEB.8.13	In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.
HEB.9.1	Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
HEB.9.2	For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.
HEB.9.3	And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;
HEB.9.4	Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
HEB.9.5	And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
HEB.9.6	Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.
HEB.9.7	But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:
HEB.9.8	The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:
HEB.9.9	Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
HEB.9.10	Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.
HEB.9.11	But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
HEB.9.12	Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.
HEB.9.13	For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:
HEB.9.14	How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
HEB.9.15	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
HEB.9.16	For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.
HEB.9.17	For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.
HEB.9.18	Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.
HEB.9.19	For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,
HEB.9.20	Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.
HEB.9.21	Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.
HEB.9.22	And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
HEB.9.23	It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
HEB.9.24	For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:
HEB.9.25	Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;
HEB.9.26	For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
HEB.9.27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
HEB.9.28	So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
HEB.10.1	For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
HEB.10.2	For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.
HEB.10.3	But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.
HEB.10.4	For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
HEB.10.5	Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:
HEB.10.6	In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
HEB.10.7	Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
HEB.10.8	Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;
HEB.10.9	Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
HEB.10.10	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
HEB.10.11	And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
HEB.10.12	But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
HEB.10.13	From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
HEB.10.14	For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
HEB.10.15	Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
HEB.10.16	This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
HEB.10.17	And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
HEB.10.18	Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
HEB.10.19	Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
HEB.10.20	By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
HEB.10.21	And having an high priest over the house of God;
HEB.10.22	Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
HEB.10.23	Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)
HEB.10.24	And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:
HEB.10.25	Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
HEB.10.26	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
HEB.10.27	But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
HEB.10.28	He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
HEB.10.29	Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
HEB.10.30	For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
HEB.10.31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
HEB.10.32	But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;
HEB.10.33	Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.
HEB.10.34	For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.
HEB.10.35	Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.
HEB.10.36	For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.
HEB.10.37	For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.
HEB.10.38	Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
HEB.10.39	But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
HEB.11.1	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
HEB.11.2	For by it the elders obtained a good report.
HEB.11.3	Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
HEB.11.4	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.
HEB.11.5	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
HEB.11.6	But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
HEB.11.7	By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
HEB.11.8	By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
HEB.11.9	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
HEB.11.10	For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
HEB.11.11	Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.
HEB.11.12	Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
HEB.11.13	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
HEB.11.14	For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
HEB.11.15	And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
HEB.11.16	But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.
HEB.11.17	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,
HEB.11.18	Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
HEB.11.19	Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.
HEB.11.20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
HEB.11.21	By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.
HEB.11.22	By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
HEB.11.23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.
HEB.11.24	By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
HEB.11.25	Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
HEB.11.26	Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.
HEB.11.27	By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
HEB.11.28	Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
HEB.11.29	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.
HEB.11.30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.
HEB.11.31	By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.
HEB.11.32	And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:
HEB.11.33	Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
HEB.11.34	Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
HEB.11.35	Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
HEB.11.36	And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
HEB.11.37	They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
HEB.11.38	(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.
HEB.11.39	And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:
HEB.11.40	God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
HEB.12.1	Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
HEB.12.2	Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
HEB.12.3	For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.
HEB.12.4	Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.
HEB.12.5	And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:
HEB.12.6	For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
HEB.12.7	If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
HEB.12.8	But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
HEB.12.9	Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
HEB.12.10	For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.
HEB.12.11	Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.
HEB.12.12	Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;
HEB.12.13	And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.
HEB.12.14	Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:
HEB.12.15	Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;
HEB.12.16	Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.
HEB.12.17	For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.
HEB.12.18	For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
HEB.12.19	And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:
HEB.12.20	(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:
HEB.12.21	And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)
HEB.12.22	But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
HEB.12.23	To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
HEB.12.24	And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.
HEB.12.25	See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:
HEB.12.26	Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.
HEB.12.27	And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
HEB.12.28	Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:
HEB.12.29	For our God is a consuming fire.
HEB.13.1	Let brotherly love continue.
HEB.13.2	Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
HEB.13.3	Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.
HEB.13.4	Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
HEB.13.5	Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
HEB.13.6	So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
HEB.13.7	Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.
HEB.13.8	Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
HEB.13.9	Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.
HEB.13.10	We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.
HEB.13.11	For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.
HEB.13.12	Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.
HEB.13.13	Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
HEB.13.14	For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
HEB.13.15	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.
HEB.13.16	But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
HEB.13.17	Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.
HEB.13.18	Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.
HEB.13.19	But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
HEB.13.20	Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
HEB.13.21	Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
HEB.13.22	And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.
HEB.13.23	Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
HEB.13.24	Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.
HEB.13.25	Grace be with you all. Amen.
JAS.1.1	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
JAS.1.2	My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
JAS.1.3	Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
JAS.1.4	But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
JAS.1.5	If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
JAS.1.6	But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
JAS.1.7	For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
JAS.1.8	A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.
JAS.1.9	Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
JAS.1.10	But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
JAS.1.11	For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
JAS.1.12	Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
JAS.1.13	Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
JAS.1.14	But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
JAS.1.15	Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
JAS.1.16	Do not err, my beloved brethren.
JAS.1.17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
JAS.1.18	Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
JAS.1.19	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
JAS.1.20	For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
JAS.1.21	Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
JAS.1.22	But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
JAS.1.23	For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
JAS.1.24	For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
JAS.1.25	But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
JAS.1.26	If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.
JAS.1.27	Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.
JAS.2.1	My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.
JAS.2.2	For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
JAS.2.3	And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
JAS.2.4	Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
JAS.2.5	Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
JAS.2.6	But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
JAS.2.7	Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
JAS.2.8	If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
JAS.2.9	But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
JAS.2.10	For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.
JAS.2.11	For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
JAS.2.12	So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
JAS.2.13	For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
JAS.2.14	What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
JAS.2.15	If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
JAS.2.16	And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?
JAS.2.17	Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
JAS.2.18	Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
JAS.2.19	Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
JAS.2.20	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
JAS.2.21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
JAS.2.22	Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
JAS.2.23	And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
JAS.2.24	Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
JAS.2.25	Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?
JAS.2.26	For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
JAS.3.1	My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
JAS.3.2	For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.
JAS.3.3	Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.
JAS.3.4	Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.
JAS.3.5	Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
JAS.3.6	And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
JAS.3.7	For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:
JAS.3.8	But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
JAS.3.9	Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.
JAS.3.10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
JAS.3.11	Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?
JAS.3.12	Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
JAS.3.13	Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
JAS.3.14	But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
JAS.3.15	This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
JAS.3.16	For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
JAS.3.18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
JAS.4.1	From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?
JAS.4.2	Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.
JAS.4.3	Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.
JAS.4.4	Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
JAS.4.5	Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
JAS.4.6	But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
JAS.4.7	Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
JAS.4.8	Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.
JAS.4.9	Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
JAS.4.10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
JAS.4.11	Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
JAS.4.12	There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?
JAS.4.13	Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:
JAS.4.14	Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
JAS.4.15	For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
JAS.4.16	But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
JAS.4.17	Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
JAS.5.1	Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.
JAS.5.2	Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.
JAS.5.3	Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.
JAS.5.4	Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.
JAS.5.5	Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.
JAS.5.6	Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.
JAS.5.7	Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.
JAS.5.8	Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
JAS.5.9	Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.
JAS.5.10	Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.
JAS.5.11	Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.
JAS.5.12	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.
JAS.5.13	Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
JAS.5.14	Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
JAS.5.15	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
JAS.5.16	Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
JAS.5.17	Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.
JAS.5.18	And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
JAS.5.19	Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;
JAS.5.20	Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.
1PE.1.1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
1PE.1.2	Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
1PE.1.3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
1PE.1.4	To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,
1PE.1.5	Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
1PE.1.6	Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:
1PE.1.7	That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:
1PE.1.8	Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
1PE.1.9	Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.
1PE.1.10	Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:
1PE.1.11	Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.
1PE.1.12	Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.
1PE.1.13	Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
1PE.1.14	As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:
1PE.1.15	But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;
1PE.1.16	Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.
1PE.1.17	And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:
1PE.1.18	Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;
1PE.1.19	But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:
1PE.1.20	Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,
1PE.1.21	Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.
1PE.1.22	Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:
1PE.1.23	Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.
1PE.1.24	For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:
1PE.1.25	But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.
1PE.2.1	Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,
1PE.2.2	As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:
1PE.2.3	If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
1PE.2.4	To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,
1PE.2.5	Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
1PE.2.6	Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.
1PE.2.7	Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,
1PE.2.8	And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.
1PE.2.9	But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:
1PE.2.10	Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
1PE.2.11	Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
1PE.2.12	Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
1PE.2.13	Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;
1PE.2.14	Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.
1PE.2.15	For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
1PE.2.16	As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.
1PE.2.17	Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
1PE.2.18	Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
1PE.2.19	For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
1PE.2.20	For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.
1PE.2.21	For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:
1PE.2.22	Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
1PE.2.23	Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:
1PE.2.24	Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.
1PE.2.25	For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
1PE.3.1	Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;
1PE.3.2	While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.
1PE.3.3	Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;
1PE.3.4	But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.
1PE.3.5	For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:
1PE.3.6	Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.
1PE.3.7	Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.
1PE.3.8	Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:
1PE.3.9	Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.
1PE.3.10	For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:
1PE.3.11	Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.
1PE.3.12	For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.
1PE.3.13	And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?
1PE.3.14	But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;
1PE.3.15	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:
1PE.3.16	Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.
1PE.3.17	For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.
1PE.3.18	For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:
1PE.3.19	By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;
1PE.3.20	Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.
1PE.3.21	The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:
1PE.3.22	Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
1PE.4.1	Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;
1PE.4.2	That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
1PE.4.3	For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:
1PE.4.4	Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:
1PE.4.5	Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.
1PE.4.6	For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
1PE.4.7	But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.
1PE.4.8	And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.
1PE.4.9	Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
1PE.4.10	As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
1PE.4.11	If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
1PE.4.12	Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:
1PE.4.13	But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.
1PE.4.14	If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
1PE.4.15	But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.
1PE.4.16	Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.
1PE.4.17	For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?
1PE.4.18	And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
1PE.4.19	Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.
1PE.5.1	The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
1PE.5.2	Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
1PE.5.3	Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.
1PE.5.4	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.
1PE.5.5	Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
1PE.5.6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
1PE.5.7	Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
1PE.5.8	Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
1PE.5.9	Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.
1PE.5.10	But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.
1PE.5.11	To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
1PE.5.12	By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
1PE.5.13	The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Mark my son.
1PE.5.14	Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2PE.1.1	Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:
2PE.1.2	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
2PE.1.3	According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
2PE.1.4	Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
2PE.1.5	And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
2PE.1.6	And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
2PE.1.7	And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
2PE.1.8	For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.9	But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
2PE.1.10	Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:
2PE.1.11	For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.12	Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.
2PE.1.13	Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;
2PE.1.14	Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.
2PE.1.15	Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.
2PE.1.16	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
2PE.1.17	For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
2PE.1.18	And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.
2PE.1.19	We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
2PE.1.20	Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
2PE.1.21	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
2PE.2.1	But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.
2PE.2.2	And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
2PE.2.3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.
2PE.2.4	For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
2PE.2.5	And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
2PE.2.6	And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;
2PE.2.7	And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:
2PE.2.8	(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)
2PE.2.9	The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:
2PE.2.10	But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.
2PE.2.11	Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.
2PE.2.12	But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;
2PE.2.13	And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;
2PE.2.14	Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:
2PE.2.15	Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
2PE.2.16	But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.
2PE.2.17	These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.
2PE.2.18	For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.
2PE.2.19	While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.
2PE.2.20	For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.
2PE.2.21	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
2PE.2.22	But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.
2PE.3.1	This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:
2PE.3.2	That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:
2PE.3.3	Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
2PE.3.4	And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
2PE.3.5	For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:
2PE.3.6	Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
2PE.3.7	But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
2PE.3.8	But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
2PE.3.9	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
2PE.3.10	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
2PE.3.11	Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,
2PE.3.12	Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
2PE.3.13	Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
2PE.3.14	Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.
2PE.3.15	And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;
2PE.3.16	As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.
2PE.3.17	Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.
2PE.3.18	But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.
1JN.1.1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;
1JN.1.2	(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)
1JN.1.3	That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
1JN.1.4	And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
1JN.1.5	This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
1JN.1.6	If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:
1JN.1.7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
1JN.1.8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
1JN.1.9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
1JN.1.10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
1JN.2.1	My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
1JN.2.2	And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.
1JN.2.3	And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
1JN.2.4	He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
1JN.2.5	But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.
1JN.2.6	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
1JN.2.7	Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.
1JN.2.8	Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.
1JN.2.9	He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.
1JN.2.10	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.
1JN.2.11	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.
1JN.2.12	I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.
1JN.2.13	I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.
1JN.2.14	I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.
1JN.2.15	Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
1JN.2.16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
1JN.2.17	And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
1JN.2.18	Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.
1JN.2.19	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.
1JN.2.20	But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.
1JN.2.21	I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
1JN.2.22	Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.
1JN.2.23	Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.
1JN.2.24	Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.
1JN.2.25	And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.
1JN.2.26	These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.
1JN.2.27	But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.
1JN.2.28	And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
1JN.2.29	If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.
1JN.3.1	Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
1JN.3.2	Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
1JN.3.3	And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
1JN.3.4	Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
1JN.3.5	And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
1JN.3.6	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.
1JN.3.7	Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
1JN.3.8	He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
1JN.3.9	Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
1JN.3.10	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
1JN.3.11	For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
1JN.3.12	Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
1JN.3.13	Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
1JN.3.14	We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.
1JN.3.15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
1JN.3.16	Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
1JN.3.17	But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
1JN.3.18	My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
1JN.3.19	And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
1JN.3.20	For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
1JN.3.21	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.
1JN.3.22	And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
1JN.3.23	And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
1JN.3.24	And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.
1JN.4.1	Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
1JN.4.2	Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
1JN.4.3	And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
1JN.4.4	Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
1JN.4.5	They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.
1JN.4.6	We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
1JN.4.7	Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
1JN.4.8	He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
1JN.4.9	In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
1JN.4.10	Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
1JN.4.11	Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
1JN.4.12	No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
1JN.4.13	Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
1JN.4.14	And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
1JN.4.15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
1JN.4.16	And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
1JN.4.17	Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
1JN.4.18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
1JN.4.19	We love him, because he first loved us.
1JN.4.20	If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
1JN.4.21	And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.
1JN.5.1	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
1JN.5.2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.
1JN.5.3	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
1JN.5.4	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.
1JN.5.5	Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
1JN.5.6	This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.
1JN.5.7	For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
1JN.5.8	And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.
1JN.5.9	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.
1JN.5.10	He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
1JN.5.11	And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
1JN.5.12	He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
1JN.5.13	These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
1JN.5.14	And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:
1JN.5.15	And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.
1JN.5.16	If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.
1JN.5.17	All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
1JN.5.18	We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.
1JN.5.19	And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.
1JN.5.20	And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
1JN.5.21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
2JN.1.1	The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;
2JN.1.2	For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.
2JN.1.3	Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
2JN.1.4	I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.
2JN.1.5	And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
2JN.1.6	And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.
2JN.1.7	For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.
2JN.1.8	Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.
2JN.1.9	Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.
2JN.1.10	If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:
2JN.1.11	For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
2JN.1.12	Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.
2JN.1.13	The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
3JN.1.1	The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
3JN.1.2	Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
3JN.1.3	For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
3JN.1.4	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
3JN.1.5	Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;
3JN.1.6	Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:
3JN.1.7	Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
3JN.1.8	We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.
3JN.1.9	I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
3JN.1.10	Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.
3JN.1.11	Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
3JN.1.12	Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.
3JN.1.13	I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:
3JN.1.14	But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.
JUD.1.1	Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:
JUD.1.2	Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
JUD.1.3	Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.
JUD.1.4	For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
JUD.1.5	I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
JUD.1.6	And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
JUD.1.7	Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
JUD.1.8	Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.
JUD.1.9	Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
JUD.1.10	But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.
JUD.1.11	Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.
JUD.1.12	These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
JUD.1.13	Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.
JUD.1.14	And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,
JUD.1.15	To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
JUD.1.16	These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.
JUD.1.17	But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
JUD.1.18	How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.
JUD.1.19	These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.
JUD.1.20	But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,
JUD.1.21	Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
JUD.1.22	And of some have compassion, making a difference:
JUD.1.23	And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
JUD.1.24	Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,
JUD.1.25	To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.
REV.1.1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:
REV.1.2	Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.
REV.1.3	Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.
REV.1.4	John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
REV.1.5	And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
REV.1.6	And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
REV.1.7	Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.
REV.1.9	I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
REV.1.10	I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,
REV.1.11	Saying, 
REV.1.12	And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
REV.1.13	And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.
REV.1.14	His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;
REV.1.15	And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.
REV.1.16	And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.
REV.1.17	And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, 
REV.4.1	After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.
REV.4.2	And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.
REV.4.3	And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.
REV.4.4	And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.
REV.4.5	And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
REV.4.6	And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.
REV.4.7	And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.
REV.4.8	And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.
REV.4.9	And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,
REV.4.10	The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
REV.4.11	Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
REV.5.1	And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.
REV.5.2	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
REV.5.3	And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.
REV.5.4	And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.
REV.5.5	And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.
REV.5.6	And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
REV.5.7	And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.
REV.5.8	And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.
REV.5.9	And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
REV.5.10	And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.
REV.5.11	And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
REV.5.12	Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.
REV.5.13	And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.
REV.5.14	And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.
REV.6.1	And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.
REV.6.2	And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
REV.6.3	And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.
REV.6.4	And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.
REV.6.5	And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.
REV.6.6	And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
REV.6.7	And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.
REV.6.8	And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.
REV.6.9	And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:
REV.6.10	And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?
REV.6.11	And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.
REV.6.12	And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;
REV.6.13	And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.
REV.6.14	And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
REV.6.15	And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;
REV.6.16	And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
REV.6.17	For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?
REV.7.1	And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
REV.7.2	And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
REV.7.3	Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.
REV.7.4	And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.
REV.7.5	Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.
REV.7.6	Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.
REV.7.7	Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.
REV.7.8	Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.
REV.7.9	After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;
REV.7.10	And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.
REV.7.11	And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,
REV.7.12	Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.
REV.7.13	And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?
REV.7.14	And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
REV.7.15	Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.
REV.7.16	They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.
REV.7.17	For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
REV.8.1	And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.
REV.8.2	And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.
REV.8.3	And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
REV.8.4	And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.
REV.8.5	And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
REV.8.6	And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
REV.8.7	The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
REV.8.8	And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;
REV.8.9	And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
REV.8.10	And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;
REV.8.11	And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
REV.8.12	And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.
REV.8.13	And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!
REV.9.1	And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
REV.9.2	And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
REV.9.3	And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
REV.9.4	And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.
REV.9.5	And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.
REV.9.6	And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
REV.9.7	And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.
REV.9.8	And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.
REV.9.9	And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.
REV.9.10	And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.
REV.9.11	And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.
REV.9.12	One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.
REV.9.13	And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,
REV.9.14	Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.
REV.9.15	And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.
REV.9.16	And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.
REV.9.17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.
REV.9.18	By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.
REV.9.19	For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.
REV.9.20	And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:
REV.9.21	Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
REV.10.1	And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
REV.10.2	And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,
REV.10.3	And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.
REV.10.4	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.
REV.10.5	And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,
REV.10.6	And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:
REV.10.7	But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
REV.10.8	And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.
REV.10.9	And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
REV.10.10	And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
REV.10.11	And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.
REV.11.1	And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.
REV.11.2	But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.
REV.11.3	And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.
REV.11.4	These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.
REV.11.5	And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.
REV.11.6	These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
REV.11.7	And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.
REV.11.8	And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
REV.11.9	And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.
REV.11.10	And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.
REV.11.11	And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.
REV.11.12	And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.
REV.11.13	And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
REV.11.14	The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.
REV.11.15	And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
REV.11.16	And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,
REV.11.17	Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.
REV.11.18	And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.
REV.11.19	And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.
REV.12.1	And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:
REV.12.2	And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
REV.12.3	And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.
REV.12.4	And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.
REV.12.5	And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.
REV.12.6	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.
REV.12.7	And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
REV.12.8	And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
REV.12.9	And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
REV.12.10	And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.
REV.12.11	And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.
REV.12.12	Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.
REV.12.13	And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.
REV.12.14	And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
REV.12.15	And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.
REV.12.16	And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
REV.12.17	And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
REV.13.1	And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.
REV.13.2	And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.
REV.13.3	And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.
REV.13.4	And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?
REV.13.5	And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.
REV.13.6	And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
REV.13.7	And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.
REV.13.8	And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
REV.13.9	If any man have an ear, let him hear.
REV.13.10	He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
REV.13.11	And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
REV.13.12	And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
REV.13.13	And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,
REV.13.14	And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
REV.13.15	And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
REV.13.16	And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
REV.13.17	And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
REV.13.18	Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.
REV.14.1	And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.
REV.14.2	And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:
REV.14.3	And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.
REV.14.4	These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.
REV.14.5	And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.
REV.14.6	And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,
REV.14.7	Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
REV.14.8	And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
REV.14.9	And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
REV.14.10	The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
REV.14.11	And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
REV.14.12	Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
REV.14.13	And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.
REV.14.14	And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
REV.14.15	And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
REV.14.16	And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.
REV.14.17	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
REV.14.18	And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.
REV.14.19	And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
REV.14.20	And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.
REV.15.1	And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.
REV.15.2	And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.
REV.15.3	And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.
REV.15.4	Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.
REV.15.5	And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:
REV.15.6	And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.
REV.15.7	And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
REV.15.8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.
REV.16.1	And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
REV.16.2	And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.
REV.16.3	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.
REV.16.4	And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.
REV.16.5	And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.
REV.16.6	For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.
REV.16.7	And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.
REV.16.8	And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.
REV.16.9	And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.
REV.16.10	And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,
REV.16.11	And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.
REV.16.12	And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.
REV.16.13	And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
REV.16.14	For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
REV.16.16	And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.
REV.16.17	And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.
REV.16.18	And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.
REV.16.19	And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
REV.16.20	And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
REV.16.21	And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.
REV.17.1	And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:
REV.17.2	With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
REV.17.3	So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
REV.17.4	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:
REV.17.5	And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
REV.17.6	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.
REV.17.7	And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.
REV.17.8	The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
REV.17.9	And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.
REV.17.10	And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.
REV.17.11	And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.
REV.17.12	And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.
REV.17.13	These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.
REV.17.14	These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.
REV.17.15	And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
REV.17.16	And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.
REV.17.17	For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
REV.17.18	And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.
REV.18.1	And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.
REV.18.2	And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.
REV.18.3	For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
REV.18.4	And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
REV.18.5	For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.
REV.18.6	Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.
REV.18.7	How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
REV.18.8	Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.
REV.18.9	And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
REV.18.10	Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
REV.18.11	And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:
REV.18.12	The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,
REV.18.13	And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.
REV.18.14	And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.
REV.18.15	The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
REV.18.16	And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!
REV.18.17	For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,
REV.18.18	And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!
REV.18.19	And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.
REV.18.20	Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.
REV.18.21	And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
REV.18.22	And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;
REV.18.23	And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
REV.18.24	And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.
REV.19.1	And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:
REV.19.2	For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
REV.19.3	And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.
REV.19.4	And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.
REV.19.5	And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.
REV.19.6	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.
REV.19.7	Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
REV.19.8	And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
REV.19.9	And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.
REV.19.10	And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
REV.19.11	And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
REV.19.12	His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
REV.19.13	And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
REV.19.14	And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
REV.19.15	And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
REV.19.16	And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND 
REV.19.17	And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;
REV.19.18	That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.
REV.19.19	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
REV.19.20	And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
REV.19.21	And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.
REV.20.1	And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
REV.20.2	And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
REV.20.3	And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.
REV.20.4	And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
REV.20.5	But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
REV.20.6	Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
REV.20.7	And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
REV.20.8	And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
REV.20.9	And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
REV.20.10	And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
REV.20.11	And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
REV.20.12	And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
REV.20.13	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
REV.20.14	And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
REV.20.15	And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
REV.21.1	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
REV.21.2	And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
REV.21.3	And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.
REV.21.4	And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
REV.21.5	And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
REV.21.6	And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
REV.21.7	He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
REV.21.8	But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
REV.21.9	And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.
REV.21.10	And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,
REV.21.11	Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
REV.21.12	And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
REV.21.13	On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
REV.21.14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
REV.21.15	And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
REV.21.16	And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
REV.21.17	And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
REV.21.18	And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.
REV.21.19	And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;
REV.21.20	The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
REV.21.21	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.
REV.21.22	And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
REV.21.23	And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.
REV.21.24	And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.
REV.21.25	And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
REV.21.26	And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.
REV.21.27	And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.
REV.22.1	And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
REV.22.2	In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
REV.22.3	And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:
REV.22.4	And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.
REV.22.5	And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
REV.22.6	And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.
REV.22.8	And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things.
REV.22.9	Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.
REV.22.10	And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.
REV.22.11	He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
REV.22.14	Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.
REV.22.15	For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.
REV.22.17	And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
REV.22.18	For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:
REV.22.19	And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.
REV.22.20	He which testifieth these things saith, 
REV.22.21	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
