PSA.23.1	The Rai, mi-Duvvel is my bokkengro. He dels mandi all I need. 
PSA.23.2	He kers mandi to atch in green puvs. He kurs me alongside shukar pani. 
PSA.23.3	He kers mandi kushti. He brings me along the kushti drom, and everyone dels him a kushti nav. 
PSA.23.4	I jel down between the mountains where mullering hangs over the tan like a cloud, but I ain't trashed of no wafedipen, because tutti's adoi with mandi. With a tikni kosh and a bori kosh, you make me feel safe. 
PSA.23.5	You ker hobben for mandi even when our enemies are dikking us. You ker my bal rinkeni with oil and del mandi more to pi than I can kur in my dui-dass. 
PSA.23.6	Tatchipen, I shall get komoben and kushtipen sor the divvuses 'dre my jivapen. I shall atch in mi Duvvel's ker forever.
PSA.34.10	The foki that roder the Rai mi-Duvvel, won't have to go without any kushti kovvel.
PSA.62.8	Put your trust in lesti sor the chairus.
PSA.79.13	Then we are tutti's foki, the flock from tutti's bokro-puv. “Parika tut”, we pukker. “Parika tut for ever.” Dadrus and dai sor amendi, will pukker to their chavvies, and teh chavvies will pukker to their kokkero chavvies: “How kushti is mi-Duvvel.”
PSA.95.6+PSA.95.7	Vel akai, let us worship and bow down and kneel before the Rai who kerred us; we are the foki of his bokro-puv, the bokros under his vast.
PSA.100.3	Shun-ta! mi-Duvvel is the Rai. He kerred us. We are lesti's. We are the bukros in his puv.
PSA.119.176	I've prastered avri like a nasherdi bokro but mandi's still tutti's gero: av to dik for mandi because I won't bister what tutti's pukkered us to ker.
ISA.40.11	The Rai, mi-Duvvel will del his flock hobben like a bokkengro. He'll lel the tikno bokros with his vasters, and carry them agen his kokkero. And he'll bring along the bori bokries, that's going to have tiknies, he'll bring them along most shukarly.
ISA.53.6	We've all prastered off like a load of bokros. We've jelled off down our own drom. But the Rai has kurred sor our wafedipen on lesti.
ISA.55.6	Dik for the Rai karna you can latcher him. Pukker to lesti karna he's posh o tutti.
EZK.34.6	My bokros jelled all over the mountains and opre the hills. My bokros prastered all over the tem. Kekomoni dikked for them, and there was never a mush to roder them. 
EZK.34.11	So the Rai, mi-Duvvel rokkered: “Dik-ai! I will jell and dik for my bokros my kokkero. A bokkengro jels to dik for his bokros when they're nashered, and I'm jelling to dik for my bokros. 
EZK.34.12	They nashered avri one divvus when there was clouds and bori kaulipen; but I will lel them kushti from their bokki tans. 
EZK.34.15	I will be mandi's bokros' bokkengro mi-kokkero and ker them to besh alé shukarly.”
MAT.9.36	When Jesus dikked sor teh foki he felt sorry for them, because they'd been harassed and there was kekomoni to del them a vast. They were like bokros with no bokkengro.
MAT.11.28	Av to mandi your weary foki been buti-ing too hard, and I will ker tutti tgo besh ale shukarly.
MRK.6.34	Jesus dikked a lot of foki and he felt sorry for them because they were like bokros with no bokkengro. He jelled over to teach them a lot of kushti lavs.
LUK.15.3	Jesus pukkered them this parable: 
LUK.15.4	“Suppose tutti's got a hundred bokros and yek of them's nasherdi. Is there a mush among the lot of you as would not muk the wavver ninety-nine in the bokros-puv and jel after the nasherdi bokro till he latchers it? 
LUK.15.5	Karna he's latchered it he riggers it on his dummer, well-pleased he is. 
LUK.15.6	Karna he jels home he pukkers his friends and all the fokji around: ‘Be happy with mandi, because I've found my nasherdi bokro.’”
LUK.19.10	Jesus penned: The Chal velled to roder the nasherdi foki and ker them kushti.
JHN.6.37	If a geri avs to mandi, I will not kur him avri.
JHN.10.1	“Tatchipen, I pen tutti: if an a mush don't jel adre the bokros' tan through the woodar, but over the fence, that mush is a chorer. 
JHN.10.2	Tatchipen, the mush who jels into the bokros' tan by the woodar is the tatchi bokkengro. 
JHN.10.3	The mush who atches opre by the woodar will always muk the tatchi bokkengro adre. The bokros shun lesti, he pukkers their navs, the ones that belong to him, and leads them avri. 
JHN.10.4	When he's kurred sor his kokkero bokros avri, he jels ahead of them and they jel after him, because they jin his rokkeripen. 
JHN.10.5	They won't jel after a wavver mush: they's praster off because they wouldn't jin a wavver mush's rokkeripen.” 
JHN.10.6	When Jesus penned these lavs, the foki didn't jin what he was on about. 
JHN.10.7	So Jesus pukkered them again: “Tatchipen, mandi pukkers tutti, I am the woodar of the bokros' tan. 
JHN.10.8	Tatchipen, the wavver mushes, that pukkered to the bokros before, are bori blaggards and chorers, but them bokros didn't jin what they was rokkering. 
JHN.10.9	I am the woodar mi-kokkero. If anyone jels in by mandi they'll be kushti, they'll jell adoi and asa and find chaw to hal. 
JHN.10.10	The chorer only vells to chore and muller and pogger. I velled to del them jivaben, dosta, dosta jivaben.”
JHN.10.11	“I am the kusti bokkengro. The kushti bokkengro dels his meripen for the bokros. 
JHN.10.12	A mush who's just been bunged a few bar to watch them for a bit, he won't protect them from the wolf, like the tatchi bokkengro would. He'll shav off on his kokkero and muk the bokros behind. The wolf'll lel one or two and the wavvers'll praster. 
JHN.10.13	The mush who's just buti-ing for a guvnor don't care what happenss to the bokros.
JHN.10.14	“I am the kushti bokkengro. I jin mandi's kushti bokros, and my kokkero bokros jin mandi. 
JHN.10.15	In the same way our Dadrus jins mandi, and I jin our Dadrus. I del my meripen for my bokros. 
JHN.10.16	And I've got wavver bokros in wavver borko-tans. I must kur them along too, and they will shun my rokkeripen. So there will be one lot of bokros and one bokkengro. 
JHN.10.17	Our Dadrus koms mandi because I del my meripen so as to lel it aglé. 
JHN.10.18	Kekomoni lels my meripen from mandi: I del it my kokkero. I can del it avri and I can lel it aglé. This is what my Dadrus pukkered mandi to ker.”
JHN.10.27	“Mandi's bokros shun my rokkeripen, and I jin them, and they av pala mandi. 
JHN.10.28	I ker their jivapen to last forever, and they never shall muller. Kekomoni shall lel them from my vast. 
JHN.10.29	My Dadrus delled them to mandi. He is the bori Rai of them all. Kekomoni can lel them avri from my Dadrus' vast. 
JHN.10.30	I and my Dadrus are yek.”
ROM.5.6	Karna there was kekomoni to del us a vast, Christ mullered for foki that didn't kom mi-Duvvel. He mullered for us just as the right chairus. 
ROM.5.8	Mi-Duvvel sikkered how he kommed us. Karna we were still kerring wafedes, Christ mullered for us.
2TI.3.14	Jel on kerring what you've learned and jin to be tatchi, because you jin who taught you them kovvels.
HEB.13.20+HEB.13.21	Akno, remember the Duvvel who kers peace. Our Rai Jesus, the bori bokkengro was mullered, and mi-Duvvel kerred him jivdi again. Mi-Duvvel will del you everything kushti, so that tutti can ker what he koms tutti to ker. Mi-Duvvel will ker you kushti for him to dik, because of what Jesus Christ kerred for us. So, glory to Jesus throughout sor the chairus.
1PE.1.7+1PE.1.8	Jesus Christ: you never dikked him, still you kom lesti.
1PE.2.21	Christ had it waffedi on account of tutti. But tutti can be like him, and jel the same drom he jelled.
1PE.2.25	Yekorus you nashed avri like bokros, but akno you've jelled palé to the bokkengro who keeps your spirit kushti.
1JN.4.19	We kom lesti because he kommed us anglé.
REV.4.11	Mi-Duvvel, tutti kerred so the kovvels that be. Tutti kommed them to be and kerred them your kokkero.
