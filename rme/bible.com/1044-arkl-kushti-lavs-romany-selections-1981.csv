MRK.1.40	A leper (a nafli mush) jelled up to Jesus,
MRK.1.40	knelt down,
MRK.1.40	and putched him to help.
MRK.1.40	“If you want,” the mush pukkered,
MRK.1.40	“you can make me kushti again.”
MRK.1.41	Jesus felt sorry for him
MRK.1.41	and reached out his vast
MRK.1.41	to touch him.
MRK.1.41	“I'll ker it for tuti,” he answered.
MRK.1.41	“Av kushti!”
MRK.1.42	Straightaway the naflipen mukked the mush
MRK.1.42	and he was kushti again.
MRK.1.43	Then Jesus bitchered him away,
MRK.1.43	and rokkered him, very strict,
MRK.1.44	“Shun-ta,” he pukkered,
MRK.1.44	“don't pukker no-one what's happened.
MRK.1.44	Jell straight to the rashai,
MRK.1.44	let him dick you,
MRK.1.44	then jell and muller an animal
MRK.1.44	for a sacrifice
MRK.1.44	according to the laws of Moses,
MRK.1.44	to sikker everyone you're kushti again.”
MRK.1.45	But the man jelled off
MRK.1.45	and pukkered what had happened
MRK.1.45	to everyone he dicked.
MRK.1.45	He rokkered that much,
MRK.1.45	Jesus could not jell into a gav
MRK.1.45	where foki could dick him.
MRK.1.45	They gave him no peace,
MRK.1.45	so he atched out on his kokero
MRK.1.45	in lonely places,
MRK.1.45	but the foki still jelled
MRK.1.45	to dick him from all over.
MRK.12.41	Jesus beshed adre the tan
MRK.12.41	where the kongeri
MRK.12.41	kept their lovva.
MRK.12.41	He dicked all the foki
MRK.12.41	delling their lovva.
MRK.12.41	Rich foki jelled by
MRK.12.41	and delled a lot of lovva,
MRK.12.41	buti lovva, yek bar,
MRK.12.41	dui bar, even a jacks.
MRK.12.42	Then a poor widow-woman
MRK.12.42	jelled by and only kurred
MRK.12.42	a couple of farthings in.
MRK.12.43	But Jesus called
MRK.12.43	his mushes together
MRK.12.43	and pukkered them,
MRK.12.43	“I pen tuti,
MRK.12.43	this poor widow-woman
MRK.12.43	delled more for the kongeri
MRK.12.43	than all the waver foki.
MRK.12.44	The waver foki delled some lovva
MRK.12.44	but they still had plenty more.
MRK.12.44	She had nixes
MRK.12.44	but she gave everything she had.
MRK.12.44	She even delled them
MRK.12.44	her bread money,
MRK.12.44	the little bit of lovva
MRK.12.44	she needed to kin moro.”
LUK.4.16	Jesus jelled up to Nazareth
LUK.4.16	where he atched
LUK.4.16	when he was a chavvi.
LUK.4.16	He jelled to the kongeri
LUK.4.16	same as usual,
LUK.4.16	on the Sabbath day.
LUK.4.16	And he stood up
LUK.4.16	to read Mi-Duvvel's lil to them,
LUK.4.17	and they putched him to read
LUK.4.17	from the book of Isaiah.
LUK.4.17	He opened the lil
LUK.4.17	where it pukkers,
LUK.4.18	“Mi-Duvvel's mullo is adre mandi,
LUK.4.18	because he has kurred mandi
LUK.4.18	to rokker kushti lavs
LUK.4.18	to poor foki.
LUK.4.18	He has bitchered mandi
LUK.4.18	to kur them out of stirapen
LUK.4.18	and to kur blind foki
LUK.4.18	to dick again,
LUK.4.18	stop the harassment of foki
LUK.4.18	that have been poggered
LUK.4.18	and kerred right up
LUK.4.19	and pukker
LUK.4.19	when the time is ready
LUK.4.19	for Mi-Duvvel's buti.”
LUK.8.22	One day Jesus jelled into a boat
LUK.8.22	with his mushes,
LUK.8.22	and rokkered to them,
LUK.8.22	“Let's jell over the pani.”
LUK.8.22	So they atched out across the pani.
LUK.8.23	While the boat was jelling
LUK.8.23	over the pani,
LUK.8.23	Jesus fell a-suty.
LUK.8.23	A bori wind kurred down on the pani,
LUK.8.23	and the pani got into the boat,
LUK.8.23	trashing them half to death.
LUK.8.24	So the mushes jelled to Jesus
LUK.8.24	and atched him up, rokkering,
LUK.8.24	“Raia, Raia, we're all
LUK.8.24	about to be mullered!”
LUK.8.24	Jesus stood up
LUK.8.24	and pukkered the wind
LUK.8.24	and the storm-pani,
LUK.8.24	“Kakka, Kakka, besh alay.”
LUK.8.24	And all the godeli stopped,
LUK.8.24	and the storm quietened down.
LUK.8.25	Then Jesus pukkered
LUK.8.25	to his mushes,
LUK.8.25	“Didn't you jin mi-Duvvel
LUK.8.25	would look after you?”
LUK.8.25	But they were amazed
LUK.8.25	and trashed and rokkered
LUK.8.25	to each other,
LUK.8.25	“Who is this rai?
LUK.8.25	He pukkers the wind and the pani
LUK.8.25	what to do,
LUK.8.25	and they ker what he rokkers them.”
LUK.15.1	Then sor the dickengros and wafodi mushes jelled posho Jesus to shoon lesti. 
LUK.15.2	And the rashais and jinimengros rokkered shukarly to ledee's kokoro. They penned: “Duva mush beshes along of mokardi mushes, and hals with them.” 
LUK.15.3	Then Jesus rokkered dula lavs to them:
LUK.15.4	“Suppose yek of you mushes had a shel bokros, and yek of them nashed away. He'd ker what sor of you would. He'd muk the wavver ninety-nine and jel-to roder duva tickno bokro that's nashered. And he'd jel on dicking, till he latchered it. 
LUK.15.5	And kana the mush latchers his bokro, he riggers it on his dumo, and feels right losheno. 
LUK.15.6	And kana he's jelling back to his tan, he's savving sor the drom. He putches sor his kushti pals kitanay adre his tan, and sor the foki that were atching posho lesti, and pens: ‘Be losho along of mandi, pals, because mandi's latchered miro bokro that nashed away.’ ” 
LUK.15.7	And Jesus penned: “Mandi's pukkering sor of you the self-same kovel. Kana yek mush pens he's tatcherly ladged, tuti'll dick more pasta adre my Duvel's-tan-opre about lesti, than about ninety-nine that never did chikachi to be ladged about.”
LUK.15.8	Jesus penned: “Suppose a juvel's got desh ruppeni koronas, and yek pers telay. Won't she dooder a mumeli, and yusser all round the ker, ta roder tradderly till she latchers it? 
LUK.15.9	And kana it's latchered, she putches sor her foki kitanay adre her tan, and pens: ‘Be losho along of mandi, because mandi's latchered the ruppeni korona that perred telay.’ ” 
LUK.15.10	And Jesus penned: “Mandi's pukkering you, my Duvel's chavvies are losheno in the same way over just yek wafodi that becomes tatcherly tugno about the wafodipen he's kerred.”
LUK.15.11	Then Jesus penned them a wavver story: “A mush had dui chavvies. 
LUK.15.12	And the tarno one putched his dadrus: ‘Dad, del mandi miri noko lovva out of tuti's kovels.’ So lesti's dadrus delled the lovva to the dui prals. 
LUK.15.13	Kek būt divvuses afterwards, the tarno rackelo got sor his kovels kitanay, ta jelled avri to a duro tem, ta kana he was adoi, he pestered it all out on wafodi jivaben. 
LUK.15.14	Then, kana sor his lovva had gone, a boro bokolipen velled adre duva tem. Sig the mush didn't have chikachi. 
LUK.15.15	So, lesti jelled to buti for a rai who jibbed adre the gav. This rai bitchered him adre a puv to del hobben to the balos. 
LUK.15.16	And the chavvi got that bokolo, he would have even halled the balos' hobben, because kekomeni would del chikachi to lesti to hal.”
LUK.15.17	“And when he dicked mengi, he penned to his kokoro: ‘Sar kisi butiengries adre miro dadrus’ ker have dosta moro to hal, while mandi's mullering of bokolipen akai. Mandi'll atch opre to jel to my dadrus. 
LUK.15.18	I'll putch lesti: ‘Dad, mandi's kerred būt wafodipen aglal my Duvel, ta aglal tuti. 
LUK.15.19	Mandi's kek to be miloed tiro tatcho chavvi any more. Muk mandi be yek of tuti's butiengries.’ 
LUK.15.20	And the tarno chavvi did atch opre, and jelled home to his dadrus.”
LUK.15.20	“But he was still a boro drom avri from the ker, kana lesti's dadrus dicked lesti. His dadrus was dosta tugno, ta prastered avri to rokker with him. And kana he jelled up to him, he delled him a bori chuma. 
LUK.15.21	Then the chavvi pukkered leskro dadrus: ‘Dad, mandi's kerred būt wafodipen aglal my Duvel ta aglal tuti, and mandi's kek to be miloed tiro tatcho chavvi.’ ”
LUK.15.22	“But his dadrus pukkered the butiengries. ‘Rigger the best jeffro and del it to lesti to riv, ta chiv a jangustri opre lesti's vast, and ker chokkas on his piris. 
LUK.15.23	Ta lel the tulli gruvni and mor it, and muk us hal ta sor be losho. 
LUK.15.24	Because, you jin, mandi's chavvi was mulo, and akno he's jivdo again. Lesti was lost and akno he's latchered.’ And ledee were sor losho.”
LUK.15.25	“But sor dula cherus, the puro chavvi sas avri, adre the puv. Kana lesti jelled posho the ker, he shooned gillying and kelling. 
LUK.15.26	So he rokkered to yek of the butiengries, ta putched lesti: ‘What's going on?’ 
LUK.15.27	Ta the gero pukkered lesti: ‘Tiro pral's akai, so your dadrus has mored a tulli tickni gruvni because he's avved back kushti ta sasteem.’ ”
LUK.15.28	“Then the puro chavvi was būt kino, and wouldn't jel adre the ker. So his dadrus avved avri to rokker to him and putch him to jel adre the ker. 
LUK.15.29	But the puro chavvi pukkered his dadrus: ‘Dickai! I've butied for tuti sor these bershes and never kerred kakka bongo, but in sor that cherus tuti never delled mandi as much as a biti bokro to hal with my pals. 
LUK.15.30	Sor your jivaben tuti's butied for the vongar that duva wavver chavvi's gone and delled to lubenis. But as sig as he's velled akai, tuti's mored a tulli gruvni for lesti.’ 
LUK.15.31	‘But his dadrus penned: “My chavvi, tuti's with mandi sor the cherus, and tuti can have sor of my kovels. 
LUK.15.32	So it was kushti for us to be losheno, because tiro pral was mulo, ta he's jivdo again. Lesti shavved, but akno he's latchered.” ’ ”
LUK.16.19	There was a rich mush,
LUK.16.19	with kushti-dicking purple togs.
LUK.16.19	Every divvus
LUK.16.19	his hobben was kushti.
LUK.16.20	By his jigger
LUK.16.20	suttied a poor mush called Lazarus.
LUK.16.20	Lazarus dicked wafedi,
LUK.16.20	riffly as a juk.
LUK.16.21	He was ready to scran anything
LUK.16.21	he could get his vasters on
LUK.16.21	or kur it from the rich mush's table.
LUK.16.21	The jukels jassed up
LUK.16.21	to lick his riffly skin.
LUK.16.22	One divvus he mullered
LUK.16.22	and angels kurred him
LUK.16.22	opre to besh by Abraham in heaven.
LUK.16.22	The rich mush mullered too
LUK.16.23	and was buried.
LUK.16.23	From the mullo-tan
LUK.16.23	it was so wafedi,
LUK.16.23	he dicked up to Abraham,
LUK.16.23	a long way away,
LUK.16.23	with Lazarus by him.
LUK.16.24	So he pukkered,
LUK.16.24	“Father Abraham,
LUK.16.24	have mercy on mandi.
LUK.16.24	Putch Lazarus
LUK.16.24	to kur pani on his vaster
LUK.16.24	and put it on my mui,
LUK.16.24	this yog akai is too tatto for mandi.”
LUK.16.25	But Abraham rokkered,
LUK.16.25	“Chavvi, remember
LUK.16.25	when you were alive,
LUK.16.25	you had the kushti kovels
LUK.16.25	and Lazarus had the wafedi kovels.
LUK.16.25	Now he's got it kushti akai
LUK.16.25	and you've got it wafedi.
LUK.16.26	What's more,
LUK.16.26	a bori canyon has been kurred
LUK.16.26	between you and us,
LUK.16.26	and no one can jell across it.”
LUK.16.27	So he putched Abraham,
LUK.16.27	“I'm monging you, Father Abraham,
LUK.16.27	send Lazarus to my daddrus' ker.
LUK.16.28	I've got five brothers,
LUK.16.28	he could pukker them
LUK.16.28	so they don't have to come
LUK.16.28	to this wafedi mullo-tan.”
LUK.16.29	But Abraham rokkered,
LUK.16.29	“Your brothers can read Moses
LUK.16.29	and the old rashais' lils,
LUK.16.29	let them shun their lavs.”
LUK.16.30	Lazarus rokkered,
LUK.16.30	“Kak, Father Abraham,
LUK.16.30	but if a mullo jells to them,
LUK.16.30	they'll change their ways.”
LUK.16.31	But Abraham penned lesti,
LUK.16.31	“If they can't shun the lavs of Moses
LUK.16.31	and the old rashais' lils
LUK.16.31	they won't believe
LUK.16.31	even if they shun a mullo.”
LUK.17.11	While Jesus was on the drom
LUK.17.11	opre Jerusalem,
LUK.17.11	he jelled from Samaria to Galilee.
LUK.17.12	While he was jelling up to a gav,
LUK.17.12	he dicked ten riffli nafli mushes.
LUK.17.12	They atched
LUK.17.12	a little way away from him
LUK.17.13	and kicked up a godeli, rokkering,
LUK.17.13	“Jesus, Raia, have mercy on us!”
LUK.17.14	When Jesus dicked them,
LUK.17.14	he pukkered,
LUK.17.14	“Jell and show your kokero
LUK.17.14	to the rashais.”
LUK.17.14	While they were on their drom
LUK.17.14	their riffli naflipen mukked them.
LUK.17.14	They dicked they were kushti again.
LUK.17.15	One of the mushes
LUK.17.15	avved back to Jesus,
LUK.17.15	with a bori godeli
LUK.17.15	praising Mi-Duvvel.
LUK.17.16	He fell on his mui
LUK.17.16	in the chik of the puv before Jesus,
LUK.17.16	rokkering,
LUK.17.16	“Thank you Jesus, parika tut.”
LUK.17.16	This mush was a foreigner
LUK.17.16	from Samaria.
LUK.17.17	Jesus putched lesti,
LUK.17.17	“Weren't there ten wafedi mushes
LUK.17.17	made kushti?
LUK.17.17	Where's the wavver nine?
LUK.17.18	Isn't anybody going to av back
LUK.17.18	to praise Mi-Duvvel
LUK.17.18	for what he's kerred,
LUK.17.18	except this foreign mush
LUK.17.18	from Samaria?”
LUK.17.19	And he pukkered the mush,
LUK.17.19	“Atch opre and jell on your drom.
LUK.17.19	It is your faith
LUK.17.19	that has kerred tutti kushti again.”
LUK.23.32	Two villains were kurred out
LUK.23.32	with Jesus
LUK.23.32	to be mullered.
LUK.23.33	They avved to a tan
LUK.23.33	called “The Skull”.
LUK.23.33	The kullies crucified Jesus
LUK.23.33	with the villains posh o lesti.
LUK.23.34	But Jesus rokkered,
LUK.23.34	“Dadrus, forgive them,
LUK.23.34	they don't jin what they're kerring.”
LUK.23.34	Then the kullies tossed a coin
LUK.23.34	to dick who'd kur his bits of things.
LUK.23.35	The foki atched and dicked
LUK.23.35	while the bori rais savved at Jesus, rokkering,
LUK.23.35	“He saved wavver foki,
LUK.23.35	let's dick if he can save himself,
LUK.23.35	if he's Mi-Duvvel's tatcho chavvi,
LUK.23.35	the mush Mi-Duvvel bitchered.”
LUK.23.36	The kullies also savved at him
LUK.23.36	and gave him vinegar.
LUK.23.37	They pukkered,
LUK.23.37	“If tutti's the king of the Jews,
LUK.23.37	why can't you kur yourself
LUK.23.37	out of here?”
LUK.23.38	There was a notice above his sherro pukkering,
LUK.23.38	“THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
LUK.23.39	One of the villains
LUK.23.39	rokkered narkeri lavs to him,
LUK.23.39	“Are you pukkering us tutti's
LUK.23.39	the mush Mi-Duvvel bitchered?
LUK.23.39	Why don't you kur us all
LUK.23.39	out of here?”
LUK.23.40	But the other villain pukkered him,
LUK.23.40	“Ain't you trashed of Mi-Duvvel?
LUK.23.40	We're getting mullered, same as him.
LUK.23.41	We're getting what we deserve
LUK.23.41	but he never kerred anything bangli in his life.”
LUK.23.42	Then he putched Jesus,
LUK.23.42	“Jesus, kek bister mandi
LUK.23.42	when you jell back
LUK.23.42	to the tan where you're the Rai.”
LUK.23.43	And Jesus pukkered
LUK.23.43	“Tatchipen, tatchipen,
LUK.23.43	to-divvus as ever is,
LUK.23.43	tutti will besh by mandi
LUK.23.43	in Mi-Duvvel's tan.”
