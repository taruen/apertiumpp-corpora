LUK.12.4	Jesus pukkered: “Mandi pens tuttis, kakka be trashed of the foki that'll muller tuttis. After they mullered you they can't ker no more wafedes. 
LUK.12.5	I'll pukker tuttis who to be atrashed of. After tuttis mullered, there's a mush can lel tuttis to the Bengesko tan. Ourli, mandi pukkers tuttis, av atrashed of lesti.”
LUK.15.11	A mush had dui chavvies. 
LUK.15.12	Ta the tawno yek putched his dadrus: “Dad, del mandi miro kokkero lovva out of tutti's kovvas.” So lesti's dadrus delled the lovva to the dui prals. 
LUK.15.13	Na kek boot divvuses apauli, the tawno chavvi lelled sor his kovvas kitanay, ta jelled avri to a duro tem. Kanna he was adoi, he mukked his lovva to jell on wafedi jivapen.
LUK.15.14	Kanna sor the tawno chavvi's lovva had jelled, a bori bokkolipen velled adre duvva tem. Soon the mush had chichi. 
LUK.15.15	So, lesti jelled to buti for a rai who jivved adre the tem. Duvva rai bitchered him adre a puv to del hobben to the baulos. 
LUK.15.16	And the chavvi got that bokkolo that he even would have halled the baulos' hobben, because kekkomeni would del chichi to lesti the hall.
LUK.15.17	Eventually he dikked what a dinilo he'd been. He penned: “Sor duvva buti-mushes adre miroo dadrus' ker have dosta moro to hall, while mandi's mullering of bokkolipen akai. Mandi'll vell opre. Mandi'll jell to mo dadrus. 
LUK.15.18	Mandi'll pukker lesti: ‘Dad, mandi's kerred boot wafedipen against mo-Duvvel, and against tutti. 
LUK.15.19	Mandi's kek to be navved tutti's tatcho chavvi any more. 
LUK.15.20	Muk mandi be yek of tutti's buti-mushes.’ ”
LUK.15.20	The tawno chavvi did vell opre and jell home to his dadrus. Kanna lesti was still a duro drom avri from the ker, leskero dadrus dikked lesti. Leskero dadrus felt boro komoben adre lesti's jeelo. He prastered avri and lelled his vast and delled him a bori chuma.
LUK.15.21	The chavvi pukkered leskero dadrus: “Dad, mandi's kerred boot wafedipen against mo-Duvvel, and against tutti. Mandi's kek to be navved tutti's tatcho chavvi.” 
LUK.15.22	But his dadrus pukkered the buti-mushes: “Lel the kushtiest chouka and del it to lesti. Chiv a vangustri opre lesti's vast and chi chokkas opre lesti's peeris. 
LUK.15.23	Lel the tulli tawni gruvni. Mor it and ker us a bori kushti feast with booti hobben. 
LUK.15.24	Because tutti's jin mandi's chavvi was mullo, and akana he's got a nevi jivapen.”
JHN.3.16	Mo-Duvvel kommed foki so much that he delled his kokkero yek chavvi. He delled lesti so that sor foki, that pen lesti's the tatchipen, shall never be mullered but jiv forever.
ROM.3.23	Sor foki have kerred their kokkeros mochadi aglal mo-Duvvel's rinkeno zor.
ROM.6.23	Kerring wafedipen lels our meripen avri. But mo-Duvvel's kushti to del us to jiv forever adre Christ Jesus our boro rai.
ROM.10.9	If you can pen the lavs from mui “Jesus is the boro rai” and if you jin in your zee that mo-Duvvel kerred Jesus jivving again after he's been mullered, then tutti'll be kerred kushti.
ROM.10.10	The jinapen's avs adre tutti's zee. Adoi in tutti's zee, you're wooshered from mochadipen. Then your mui can pukker the lavs that sikker you've been kerred kushti.
1TI.2.3	Mo-Duvvel kers us kushti. 
1TI.2.4	Mo-Duvvel koms to ker sor foki kushti. Mo-Duvvel sor foki to av to jin the tatchipen.
